0,MAN," For over a century, I have lived in secret; hiding in the shadows, alone in the world. Until now. I am a vampire. And this is my story."
1,MAN," An hour's drive to hear that crap. You know, it wasn't even a band. A guy with a guitar. An hour each way."
2,GIRL, He wasn't that bad.
3,MAN, He sounded like James Blunt.
4,GIRL, What's wrong with that?
5,MAN, We already have a James Blunt. One's all we need.
6,GIRL, So why did you come?
7,MAN, Because I love you.
8,GIRL, Nicely done. What's with all the fog?
9,MAN, It'll clear in a second.
10,GIRL, Watch out!
11,MAN, Are you ok?!
12,GIRL," We just hit someone! Oh, my god!"
13,MAN, Call for help.
14,GIRL," Come on, come on! "
15,MAN," Please be alive! Oh, my god."
16,GIRL, There's no signal! Darren! Darren?
17,STEFAN, I shouldn't have come home. I know the risk. But I had no choice. I have to know her.
18,ELENA," Dear diary, today will be different. It has to be. I will smile, and it will be believable. My smile was saying ""I'm fine, thank you."" ""Yes, I feel much better."" I will no longer be the sad little girl who lost her parents. I will start fresh, be someone new. It's the only way I'll make it through."
19,JENNA, Toast. I can make toast.
20,ELENA," It's all about the coffee, aunt Jenna."
21,JEREMY, Is there coffee?
22,JENNA, Your first day of school and I'm totally unprepared. Lunch money?
23,ELENA, I'm good.
24,JENNA, Anything else? A number two pencil? What am I missing?
25,ELENA, Don't you have a big presentation today?
26,JENNA, I'm meeting with my thesis advisor at...now. Crap!
27,ELENA, Then go. We'll be fine. You ok?
28,JEREMY, Don't start.
29,BONNIE," So grams is telling me I'm psychic. Our ancestors were from salem, which isn't all that, I know, crazy, but she's going on and on about it, and I'm like, put this woman in a home already! But then I started thinking, I predicted Obama and I predicted Heath Ledger, and I still think Florida will break off and turn into little resort islands... Elena! Back in the car."
30,ELENA," I did it again, didn't I? I--I'm sorry, Bonnie. You were telling me that..."
31,BONNIE, That I'm psychic now.
32,ELENA," Right. Ok, then predict something. About me."
33,BONNIE, I see...
34,BONNIE," What was that?! Oh, my god! Elena, are you ok?"
35,ELENA, It's ok. I'm fine.
36,BONNIE, It was like a bird or something. It came out of nowhere.
37,ELENA," Really, I can't be freaked out by cars for the rest of my life."
38,BONNIE, I predict this year is going to be kick ass. And I predict all the sad and dark times are over and you are going to be beyond happy.
39,BONNIE," Major lack of male real estate. Look at the shower curtain on Kelly bitch. She looks a hot-- Can I still say ""tr*nny mess""?"
40,ELENA," No, that's over."
41,BONNIE," Ahh, find a man, coin a phrase. It's a busy year."
42,ELENA, He hates me.
43,BONNIE," That's not hate. That's ""you dumped me, but I'm too cool to show it, but secretly I'm listening to air supply's greatest hits."""
44,CAROLINE," Elena. Oh, my god. How are you? Oh, it's so good to see you. How is she? Is she good?"
45,ELENA ," Caroline, I'm right here. And I'm fine. Thank you."
46,CAROLINE, Really?
47,ELENA, Yes. Much better.
48,CAROLINE," Oh, you poor thing."
49,ELENA," Ok, Caroline."
50,CAROLINE," Oh! Ok, see you guys later?"
51,BONNIE, Ok! Bye.
52,ELENA, No comment.
53,BONNIE, I'm not going to say anything.
54,JEREMY, Don't take more than two in a six-Hour window.
55,TYLER," Hey, Vicki. I knew I'd find you here with the crackheads."
56,VICKI, Hey.
57,TYLER," Hey, Pete Wentz called. He wants his nail polish back."
58,JEREMY," Pete Wentz, huh? How old school T.R.L. of you. Carson Daly fan?"
59,VICKI," Oh, Ty, be nice. Be nice. That's Elena's little brother."
60,TYLER, I know who he is. I'll still kick his ass.
61,BONNIE, Hold up. Who's this?
62,ELENA, All I see is back.
63,BONNIE, It's a hot back.
64,SECRETARY," your records are incomplete. You're missing immunization records, and we do insist on transcripts."
65,STEFAN, Please look again. I'm sure everything you need is there.
66,SECRETARY," Well, you're right. So it is."
67,BONNIE," I'm sensing seattle, and he plays the guitar."
68,ELENA," You're really going to run this whole psychic thing into the ground, huh?"
69,BONNIE, Pretty much.
70,MAN," Jeremy, good batch, man."
71,ELENA, I'll be right back.
72,BONNIE, Please be hot.
73,BOY," Whoa! Pants down, chick!"
74,ELENA, Great. It's the first day of school and you're stoned.
75,JEREMY," No, I'm not. "
76,ELENA, Where is it? Is it on you?
77,JEREMY," Stop, all right?! You need to chill yourself, all right?"
78,ELENA," Chill myself? What is that, Stoner talk? Dude, you are so cool."
79,JEREMY," Look, stop! I don't have anything on me. Are you crazy?"
80,ELENA," You haven't seen crazy, Jeremy! I gave you a summer pass, but I am done watching you destroy yourself. No, no, no, you know what? Go ahead. Keep it up. But just know that I am going to be there to ruin your buzz every time, you got it? Jeremy, I know who you are. And it's not this person. So don't be this person."
81,JEREMY, I don't need this.
82,STEFAN, Thank you.
83,SECRETARY, You're welcome.
84,STEFAN," Uh, pardon me. Um... Is this the men's room?"
85,ELENA," Yes. Um, I was just, Um--I was just-- It's a long story. Just... Thank you."
86,TEACHER," Once our home state of virginia joined confederacy in 1861, it created a tremendous amount of tension within the state. People in virginia's northwest region Had different ideals than those from the traditional deep south. Then Virginia divided in 1863 with the northwest region joining the union."
87,Texto to Bonnie from Elena , HAWT-E. STARING @ U.
88,ELENA," Dear diary, I made it through the day. I must have said, ""I'm fine, thanks,"" at least 37 times. And I didn't mean it once. But no one noticed. When someone asks, ""how are you?"" They really don't want an answer."
89,ELENA," Ok. Hi, bird. That's not creepy or anything. Shoo! That's what I thought."
90,ELENA, Ahh!
91,STEFAN, You ok?
92,ELENA, Were you following me?
93,STEFAN," No, I, uh, I just-- I saw you fall."
94,ELENA," Uh-Huh, and you just happened to be hanging out in a cemetery."
95,STEFAN, I'm visiting. I have family here.
96,ELENA," Oh. Wow. Tactless. I'm sorry. It's the fog, It's making me foggy. And then back there, there was this bird, and it was all very hitchcock for a second. That is the bird movie, right, the hitchcock? I'm Elena."
97,STEFAN, I'm Stefan.
98,ELENA, I know. We have history together.
99,STEFAN, And english and french.
100,ELENA, Right.
101,STEFAN, Oh.
102,ELENA, Thanks. Nice ring.
103,STEFAN," Oh. Um, It's a family ring, yeah. I'm kinda stuck with it. It's weird, huh?"
104,ELENA," No, no. It's just, I mean, there are rings and then there's that."
105,STEFAN, Did you hurt yourself?
106,ELENA, Hmm? 
107,STEFAN, Did you hurt yourself?
108,ELENA," Oh, uh, I don't know. Oh! Look at that. That is not pretty. You ok?"
109,STEFAN, You should go. Take care of that.
110,ELENA," Really, it's nothing."
111,STEFAN, I lost control today. Everything I've kept buried inside came rushing to the surface. I'm simply not able to resist her.
112,JEREMY, Hey.
113,VICKI, Working.
114,MATT," Thanks, vick."
115,VICKI, Do you need another refill?
116,TYLER, I'd love one.
117,MATT, Please tell me you're not hooking up with my sister.
118,TYLER, I'm not hooking up with your sister.
119,MATT, You're such a dick.
120,JEREMY," Hey, what's your deal? I mean, summer you act one way and then school starts and you can't be bothered."
121,VICKI," Look, Jeremy, I really appreciate all the pharmaceuticals, but you can't keep following me around like a lost puppy."
122,JEREMY, When's the last time you had sex with a puppy?
123,VICKI," Hey, keep it down. I don't want to tell the whole world I deflowered Elena's kid brother."
124,JEREMY," Yeah, and deflowered and deflowered."
125,VICKI, We hooked up a few times in a drug haze. It's over. You gotta back off between you ruin things between me and Tyler.
126,JEREMY," Oh, come on, the guy's a total douche. He only wants you for your ass."
127,VICKI, Yeah? What do you want me for?
128,CAROLINE," His name is Stefan Salvatore. He lives with uncle up at the old Salvatore boarding house. He hasn't lived here since he was a kid. Military family, so they moved around a lot. He's a gemini, and his favorite color is blue."
129,BONNIE, You got all of that in one day?
130,CAROLINE," Oh, please, I got all that between third and fourth period. We're planning a june wedding."
131,ELENA, I'm meeting Bonnie at the grill.
132,JENNA," Ok, have fun. Wait, I got this. Don't stay out late, it's a school night."
133,ELENA," Well done, aunt Jenna."
134,ELENA, Oh.
135,STEFAN," Sorry, I was about to knock. I wanted to apologize for my disappearing act earlier. I know it was... Strange."
136,ELENA," No worries. I get it, bl*od makes you squeamish."
137,STEFAN," Um, something like that. How's your leg?"
138,ELENA," Oh, it's fine. Just a scratch, barely. How did you know where I lived?"
139,STEFAN," It's a small town. I asked the first person I saw. Um, I thought you might want this back."
140,ELENA," Oh, I must have dropped it. I-- Thank you."
141,STEFAN," Don't worry, I didn't...read it."
142,ELENA, No? Why not? Most people would have.
143,STEFAN," Well, I wouldn't want anyone to read mine."
144,ELENA, You keep a journal?
145,STEFAN," Yeah, if I don't write it down, I forget it. Memories are too important."
146,ELENA," Yeah. I'm just gonna, Um, you don't have to stay out there."
147,STEFAN," I'm fine. Sorry, were you going somewhere?"
148,ELENA," Yeah, I'm meeting a friend. Do you want to come?"
149,MATTt,How's Elena doing?
150,BONNIE," Her mom and dad died. How do you think? She's putting on a good face, but it's only been four months."
151,MATT, Has she said anything about me?
152,BONNIE," Oh, no. So not getting in the middle. You pick up the phone and call her."
153,MATT, I feel weird calling her. She broke up with me.
154,BONNIE," Give it more time, Matt."
155,MATT," More time, huh?"
156,MATT," Hey, I'm Matt, nice to meet you."
157,STEFAN, Hi. Stefan.
158,ELENA, Hey.
159,MATT, Hey.
160,CAROLINE," So, you were born in mystic falls?"
161,STEFAN, Mm-Hmm. And moved when I was still young.
162,BONNIE, Parents?
163,STEFAN, My parents passed away.
164,ELENA, I'm sorry. Any siblings?
165,STEFAN, None that I talk to. I live with my uncle.
166,CAROLINE," So, Stefan, if you're new, then you don't know about the party tomorrow. "
167,BONNIE, It's a back to school thing at the falls.
168,STEFAN (to Elena), Are you going?
169,BONNIE, Of course she is.
170,ZACH, You promised. 
171,STEFAN, This was an animal attack. 
172,ZACH," Don't give me that. I know the game. You tear them up enough, they always suspect an animal attack. You said you had it under control."
173,STEFAN, And I do.
174,ZACH," Please, uncle Stefan. Mystic Falls is a different place now. It's been quiet for years, but there are people who still remember. And you being here, It's just going to stir things up."
175,STEFAN, It's not my intention.
176,ZACH," Then what is? Why did you come back? After all this time, why now?"
177,STEFAN, I don't have to explain myself.
178,ZACH, I know that you can't change what you are. But you don't belong here anymore.
179,STEFAN, Where do I belong?
180,ZACH, I can't tell you what to do. But coming back here was a mistake.
181,TEACHER, The battle of willow creek took place right at the end of the w*r in our very own Mystic Falls. How many casualties resulted in this battle? Ms. Bennett?
182,BONNIE, Um...a lot? I'm not sure. Like a whole lot.
183,TEACHER," Cute becomes dumb in an instant, Ms. Bennett. Mr. Donovan. Would you like to take this opportunity to overcome your embedded jock stereotype?"
184,MATT," It's ok, Mr Tanner, I'm cool with it."
185,TANNER, Hmm. Elena? Surely you can enlighten us about one of the town's most significantly historical events?
186,ELENA," I'm sorry, I-- I don't know."
187,TANNER,"I was willing to be lenient last year for obvious reasons, Elena. But the personal excuses ended with summer break."
188,STEFAN," There were 346 casualties, Unless you're counting local civilians."
189,TANNER, That's correct. Mister... 
190,STEFAN, Salvatore.
191,TANNER, Salvatore. Any relation to the original settlers here at mystic falls?
192,STEFAN, Distant.
193,TANNER," Well, very good. Except, of course, there were no civilian casualties in this battle."
194,STEFAN," Actually, there were 27, sir. Confederate soldiers, they fired on the church, believing it to be housing w*apon. They were wrong. It was a night of great loss. The founder's archives are, uh, stored in civil hall if you'd like to brush up on your facts. Mr. Tanner."
195,TANNER, hmm.
196,ELENA, People look up to me. I have to set an example.
197,BONNIE," Just admit it, Elena."
198,ELENA," Oh, ok, so he's a little pretty."
199,BONNIE, He has that romance novel stare. 
200,ELENA," Stefan looked deep into her eyes, piercing her very soul."
201,CAROLINE, Hey! You made it!
202,STEFAN, I did.
203,CAROLINE," Well, let's get you a drink."
204,STEFAN," Well, I'm--"
205,CAROLINE," Oh, come on."
206,BONNIE, So where is he?
207,ELENA," I don't know. You tell me, you're the psychic one."
208,BONNIE," Right, I forgot. Ok, so give me a sec. Grams says I have to concentrate."
209,ELENA," Wait, you need a crystal ball."
210,BONNIE, Ahh.
211,ELENA, What?
212,BONNIE," That was weird. When I touched you, I saw a crow."
213,ELENA, What?
214,BONNIE," A crow. There was fog, a man. I'm drunk. It's the drinking. There's nothing psychic about it. Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna get a refill."
215,ELENA, Ok. Bonnie!
216,STEFAN, Hi.
217,ELENA, Hi.
218,STEFAN," I did it again, didn't it?"
219,ELENA, Yeah.
220,STEFAN, I'm sorry. You're upset about something.
221,ELENA," Oh, uh, no, it's Bonnie. She's... You know what? Never mind. You're...here."
222,STEFAN, I'm here.
223,ELENA," You know, you're kind of the talk of the town."
224,STEFAN, Am I?
225,ELENA," Mm-Hmm. Mysterious new guy, oh, yeah."
226,STEFAN," Well, you have the mysterious thing going, too. Twinged in sadness."
227,ELENA, What makes you think that I'm sad?
228,STEFAN," Well, we did meet in a graveyard."
229,ELENA," Right. Well, no, technically we met in the men's room. You don't want to know, it's... It's not exactly party chit-Chat."
230,STEFAN," Well, I've never really been very good at, uh, Chit-chat."
231,ELENA," Last spring... My parents' car drove off of a bridge into the lake. And I was in the backseat and I survived, but... They didn't. So that's my story."
232,STEFAN," You won't be sad forever, Elena."
233,VICKI," No, Ty. I'm not having sex against a tree."
234,TYLER," Oh, come on, it would be hot."
235,VICKI," For who? No, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen, not here, not like this. No. I said no. I said no! Ow, that hurts!"
236,JEREMY," Hey, leave her alone."
237,TYLER," You know, you're starting to get on my nerves, Gilbert."
238,VICKI," Just go, Tyler, get the hell away from me."
239,TYLER, Wow. Vicki donovan says no. That's a first.
240,VICKI, I didn't need your help.
241,JEREMY, It seems like you did.
242,VICKI, He was just drunk. 
243,JEREMY, I'm drunk. Am I throwing myself at you?
244,VICKI," No, you're worse. You want to talk to me, get to know me, see into my soul and screw and screw and screw until you're done with me."
245,JEREMY, Is that what you think?
246,VICKI, That's what I know.
247,STEFAN," I like Bonnie, she seems like a good friend."
248,ELENA, Best friend in the world.
249,STEFAN," And Matt, he can't seem to, uh, take his eyes off of us."
250,ELENA, Matt's that friend since childhood that you start dating because you owe it to yourselves to see if you can be more.
251,STEFAN, And?
252,ELENA," And then my parents died, and everything changes. Anyway, Matt and I, together we just, I don't know, It wasn't, um... It wasn't..."
253,STEFAN, Passionate.
254,ELENA," No. No, it wasn't passionate... Hey, um, are you ok? Um, Your eye, it just, it's--"
255,STEFAN," Oh, um... Yeah, no. It's, um, it's nothing. Um, are you thirsty? I'm gonna get us a drink."
256,VICKI, Jeremy? Is that you? Jeremy? 
257,MATT, Looking for someone?
258,ELENA, Hey. 
259,MATT," When you broke up with me, you said it was because you needed some time alone. You don't look so alone to me."
260,ELENA," Matt, you don't understand. It's--"
261,MATT," That's ok, Elena. You do what you have to do. I just want to let you know that... I still believe in us. And I'm not giving up on that."
262,ELENA, Matt...
263,CAROLINE, Hey! There you are. Have you been down to the falls yet? Because they are really cool at night. And I can show you. If you want.
264,STEFAN, I think you've had too much to drink.
265,CAROLINE," Well, of course I have. So--"
266,STEFAN," Caroline. You and me, it's not gonna happen. Sorry."
267,ELENA," I was wondering who abducted you, but now I know."
268,STEFAN," Is she like that with, uh, all the guys?"
269,ELENA," No. You're fresh meat. She'll back off eventually. Hmm. God, you gotta be kidding me!"
270,STEFAN, What is it?
271,ELENA, My brother.
272,STEFAN, The drunk one?
273,ELENA, That would be the one. Excuse me.
274,STEFAN, Need some help?
275,ELENA," Trust me, you're not going to want to witness this. Jeremy! Jeremy!"
276,ELENA," Jeremy, where the hell are you going?"
277,JEREMY, I don't want to hear it!
278,ELENA," Yeah, well, too bad!"
279,JEREMY," Vicki? No! Oh, my god, it's Vicki!"
280,ELENA," Oh, my god!"
281,JEREMY, No!
282,ELENA, Somebody help!
283,MATT," Vicki? Vicki, what the hell?!"
284,TYLER, What happened to her?
285,MATT," Somebody, call an ambulance!"
286,TYLER," Everybody back up, give her some space!"
287,ELENA, It's her neck. Something bit her. She's losing a lot of bl*od.
288,SOMEONE, Put this on her neck.
289,MATT," Vicki, Vicki, come on, open your eyes, look at me."
290,ZACH, What's going on?
291,STEFAN," Someone else was attacked tonight, Zach, and it wasn't me."
292,STEFAN, Damon.
293,DAMON," Hello, brother."
294,STEFAN," Crow's a bit much, don't you think?"
295,DAMON, Wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
296,STEFAN, When'd you get here?
297,DAMON," Well, I couldn't miss your first day at school. Your hair's different. I like it."
298,STEFAN," It's been 15 years, Damon."
299,DAMON," Thank god. I couldn't take another day of the nineties. That horrible grunge look? Did not suit you. Remember, Stefan, it's important to stay away from fads."
300,STEFAN, Why are you here?
301,DAMON, I miss my little brother.
302,STEFAN, You hate small towns. It's boring. There's nothing for you to do.
303,DAMON, I've managed to keep myself busy. 
304,STEFAN," You know, you left that girl alive tonight. That's very clumsy of you."
305,DAMON, Ah. That can be a problem... for you.
306,STEFAN, Why are you here now?
307,DAMON," I could ask you the same question. However, I'm fairly certain your answer can be summed up all into one little word... Elena."
308,BONNIE," Hey. We're gonna go mainline coffee, wait for news."
309,ELENA, I gotta take Jeremy home.
310,BONNIE," Elena, there's no way I'm psychic. I know that. But whatever I saw, or I think I saw, I have this feeling..."
311,ELENA," Bonnie, what?"
312,BONNIE, That it's just the beginning.
313,DAMON," She took my breath away. Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine. Is it working, Stefan? Being around her, being in her world? Does it make you feel alive?"
314,STEFAN, She's not Katherine.
315,DAMON," Well, let's hope not. We both know how that ended. Tell me something, when's the last time you had something stronger than a squirrel?"
316,STEFAN," I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work."
317,DAMON, Yeah? Come on. Don't you crave a little?
318,STEFAN, Stop it.
319,DAMON," Let's do it. Together. I saw a couple girls out there. Or just, let's just cut to the chase, let's just go straight for Elena!"
320,STEFAN, Stop it!
321,DAMON, Imagine what her bl*od tastes like!
322,DAMON, I can.
323,STEFAN, I said stop!
324,DAMON," I was impressed. I give it a six. Missing style, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very good with the whole face--- thing. It was good."
325,STEFAN," You know, it's all fun and games, Damon, huh? But wherever you go, people die."
326,DAMON, That's a given.
327,STEFAN, Not here. I won't allow it.
328,DAMON, I take that as an invitation.
329,STEFAN," Damon, please. After all these years, can't we just give it a rest? "
330,DAMON," I promised you an eternity of misery, so I'm just keeping my word."
331,STEFAN, Just stay away from Elena.
332,DAMON," Where's your ring? Oh, yeah, sun's coming up in a couple of hours, and, poof, ashes to ashes. Relax. It's right here."
333,DAMON," You should know better than to think you're stronger than me. You lost that fight when you stopped feeding on people. I wouldn't try it again. I think we woke Zach up. Hmm. Sorry, Zach."
334,ELENA," You ok? I called Jenna, she's on her way. Those people in uniforms, last time I checked, they're the police."
335,ELENA," People are going to stop giving you breaks, Jer. They just don't care anymore. They don't remember that our parents are dead, because they've got their own lives to deal with. The rest of the world has moved on. You should try, too."
336,JEREMY, I've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary. Is that--Is that supposed to be you moving on?
337,ELENA, Mom and dad wouldn't have wanted this.
338,BONNIE, Are you sober yet?
339,CAROLINE, No. 
340,BONNIE, Keep drinking. I gotta get you home. I gotta get me home.
341,CAROLINE," Why didn't he go for me? You know, how come the guys that I want never want me?"
342,BONNIE, I'm not touching that.
343,CAROLINE," I'm inappropriate. I always say the wrong thing. And... Elena always says the right thing. She doesn't even try! And he just picks her. And she's always the one that everyone picks, for everything. And I try so hard, and... I'm never the one."
344,BONNIE," It's not a competition, Caroline."
345,CAROLINE," Yeah, it is."
346,MATT," Vicki... Hey. Hey, it's ok. You're gonna be ok."
347,VICKI, Matt--
348,MATT," Hey, don't try to talk, ok? You're fine."
349,VICKI, Vampire.
350,ELENA," Dear diary, I couldn't have been more wrong. I thought that I could smile, nod my way through it; pretend like it would all be ok."
351,STEFAN," I had a plan. I wanted to change who I was; create a life as someone new, someone without the past."
352,ELENA, Without the pain.
353,ELENA & STEFAN, Someone alive.
354,ELENA, But it's not that easy. The bad things stay with you.
355,STEFAN, They follow you.
356,STEFAN," You can't escape them, as much as you want to."
357,ELENA," All you can do is be ready for the good. So when it comes, you invite it in, because you need it. I need it."
358,STEFAN," I know it's late. But, uh... I needed to know that you were ok."
359,ELENA," You know, for months, that's all anyone's wondered about me. If I'll be ok."
360,STEFAN, What do you tell them?
361,ELENA, That I'll be fine.
362,STEFAN, Do you ever mean it?
363,ELENA, Ask me tomorrow. It's warmer in the house. We can talk. Would you like to come in?
364,STEFAN, Yes.
365,GIRL, Hey. Did you hear that?
366,BOY, Hear what?
367,GIRL, I heard thunder.
368,BOY, There's no thunder.
369,GIRL," Are you sure? Because if it rains, then we won't be able to see the comet."
370,BOY," It's not gonna rain. Listen, i... Got you a little something. It's back in the car. Don't you move."
371,GIRL, Stay dry.
372,BOY, It's not gonna rain.
373,GIRL, I knew it! I told you it was gonna rain!
374,GIRL, Open! No! Please!
375,ELENA," Dear diary, this morning is... different. There is change. I can sense it, feel it."
376,STEFAN," I'm awake. For the first time in a long time, I feel completely and undeniably wide awake. "
377,ELENA," For once, I don't regret the day before it begins."
378,STEFAN, I welcome the day...
379,STEFAN/ELENA, Because I know...
380,STEFAN, I will see her again.
381,ELENA," I will see him again. For the first time in a long time, I feel good."
382,JENNA, Do I look adult? As in respectfully parental?
383,ELENA, Depends where you're going.
384,JENNA, Jeremy's parent-teacher conference. Hair up or down?
385,ELENA, Sexy stewardess. Boozy housewife.
386,JENNA, Up it is. You're feisty today.
387,ELENA," I feel good, which is rare. So I've decided to go with it. Fly free, walk on sunshine, and all that stuff. Where is Jeremy?"
388,JENNA," He left early. Something about getting to wood shop early to finish a birdhouse. There is no wood shop, is there?"
389,ELENA, No.
390,JENNA, Yeah.
391,NURSE," You can't be in here, hon. Visiting hours don't start till 9:00."
392,JEREMY, I just... How is she?
393,NURSE, She's lost a lot of bl*od.
394,JEREMY," Yeah, but she's gonna be ok, right?"
395,NURSE, She needs her rest. So you come back later. Come on.
396,TANNER," Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago, it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years. Now, the comet will be its brightest right after dusk during tomorrow's celebration. Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore? Ms. Gilbert?"
397,STEFAN, I brought it. Told you.
398,ELENA," ""Wuthering Heights"" by Ellis Bell. You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name."
399,STEFAN, All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms. It was the time. Female writers weren't very accepted then.
400,ELENA, Where did you get it?
401,STEFAN," Uh, it was passed down. Through the family."
402,ELENA, Ah.
403,STEFAN, I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.
404,ELENA," Oh, no. I... But I would like to read it again. I promise I'll give it back."
405,STEFAN, Ok.
406,CAROLINE, I'm confused. Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
407,BONNIE," Technically, grams says I'm a witch. My ancestors were these really cool Salem witch chicks or something.Grams tried to explain it all, but she was looped on the liquor so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes. Witches? I don't think so."
408,CAROLINE," Yeah, well, feel free to conjure up the name and number of that guy from last night."
409,BONNIE," I didn't see him, you did. Why didn't you just talk to him?"
410,CAROLINE, I don't know. I was drunk.
411,JEREMY," Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just wondering how Vicki's doing, since you guys are so close. Is she ok?"
412,TYLER, She's fine. Now get out of here.
413,JEREMY, How bad is she? Do they know what attacked her? Is she going to make a full recovery? Was she happy to see you? What room number was she in?
414,TYLER, I'm going to kick your ass.
415,JEREMY," Yeah, you keep saying that, but when are you actually going to do it? Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now."
416,TYLER," Walk away, Gilbert. It's your final warning."
417,JEREMY," No, this is your final warning, dick. I'm sick of watching you play Vicki. You hurt herne more time, I swear to God, I will k*ll you. "
418,TYLER," Damn, that was like a death threat. Did you hear that?"
419,MATT," They're keeping her overnight to make sure there's no infection, but she should be able to come home tomorrow."
420,ELENA, That's good news.
421,MATT, Yeah.
422,ELENA, Did you get in touch with your mom?
423,MATT," Called and left a message. She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend, so... we'll see how long it takes her to come rushing home."
424,ELENA, Vicki's lucky that she's ok.
425,MATT," I know, and now there's talk of some missing campers."
426,ELENA, Did she say what kind of animal it was that attacked her?
427,MATT, She said it was a vampire.
428,ELENA, What?
429,MATT," Yeah, she wakes up last night and mutters ""vampire"" and then passes out."
430,ELENA," Ok, that is weird."
431,MATT, I think she was drunk. So what's up with you and the new guy?
432,ELENA," Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you."
433,MATT," You know, I'm... I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital. I want to be there when Vickie wakes up, get the real story about last night."
434,ELENA, Ok.
435,TANNER," As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned. All right? It's the third day of school and he's skipped six of his classes."
436,JENNA," Mr. Tanner, are you aware that Jeremy and Elena's parents died?"
437,TANNER," Four months ago, a great loss. Car accident. Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly. And you're related to the family how? The, uh, mother's kid sister?"
438,JENNA, Younger sister.
439,TANNER, Right.
440,JENNA," Yes. Six classes? Are you sure? I mean, that's kind of hard to do."
441,TANNER," Not when you're on drugs. It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Summers. And the signs are there. He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative, hungover. Are there any other relatives in the picture?"
442,JENNA, I'm their sole guardian.
443,TANNER, Uh-huh. Could there be?
444,JENNA," What are you suggesting, exactly?"
445,TANNER," It's an impossible job, isn't it, raising two teens?"
446,JENNA," It's been tough, but, no, it's not."
447,TANNER," Wrong answer. It is an extremely impossible job, and anything less and you're not doing it properly."
448,MATT," Whoa! Vick. Vicki, hey. Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?"
449,VICKI, No! No! Get off! No! No! No!
450,STEFAN, It was an animal that attacked you. It came out of the night and jumped you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
451,VICKI, It's all I remember.
452,STEFAN, An animal attacked you. You blacked out. It's all you remember. It's all I remember.
453,MATT, Nurse! I need help! It's my sister.
454,NURSE, She seems fine.
455,BONNIE," Well, I was talking to grams, and she said the comet is a sign of impending doom. The last time it passed over Mystic Falls, there was lots of death. So much bl*od and carnage, it created a bed of paranormal activity."
456,CAROLINE," Yeah, and then you poured grams another sh*t and she told you about the aliens. So then what?"
457,ELENA, So then nothing.
458,CAROLINE, You and Stefan talked all night? There was no sloppy first kiss or touchy feely of any kind?
459,ELENA, Nope. We didn't go there.
460,CAROLINE," Not even a handshake? I mean, Elena, we are your friends. Ok? You are supposed to share the smut."
461,ELENA, We just talked for hours.
462,CAROLINE," Ok, what is with the blockage? Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, sex."
463,ELENA, Profound.
464,BONNIE, Where are you going?
465,ELENA," Caroline's right. It is easy. If I sit here long enough, I'll end up talking myself out of it instead of doing what I started the day saying I was going to do."
466,JENNA, I picked up dinner. Tacos. I had an urge for guacamole.
467,JEREMY," No, I'm good, thanks."
468,JENNA," Eat anyway. It's a ruse. I want to talk. Hey, you! Come. Sit. Back in school, freshman year, I could eat my weight in nachos, with extra cheese. It was my munchie food whenever I got stoned."
469,JEREMY, You get high?
470,JENNA," Did. Past tense. But, yeah. Loved it. Anything to get a little distraction from life... reality. And it worked. For a while. Never lasts, though. Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't love to rail back and kick it, but with a thesis looming and a waistline expanding..."
471,MATT, What the... 
472,VICKI, Finally you're awake.
473,MATT, Hey. How are you feeling? You look better. I was worried before. You really had me freaked out with all that screaming.
474,VICKI," Wait, what are you talking about?"
475,MATT, You don't remember?
476,VICKI, I feel fine.
477,MATT," Good, good. Doctor said you could come home tomorrow. Vick, what attacked you in the woods?"
478,VICKI, An animal. What else could it have been?
479,JEREMY, Hey. How do you feel?
480,VICKI, I'm ok.
481,MATT," I... I'm gonna... I'm gonna go grab a coffee. Hey, Jer."
482,VICKI, Why are you here?
483,JEREMY, I just wanted to see how you were doing.
484,VICKI," Did you see that look on Matt's face? That was suspicion. I don't want people to find out about us, Jeremy."
485,JEREMY," Well, you gotta get over that."
486,VICKI, Tyler is finally showing some interest.
487,JEREMY," You have to get over that, too. Do you see Mr. Concerned? Tyler? Are you under there? No."
488,VICKI," It's not cool for people to know. Ok? I'm older than you, and Matt and Elena would freak."
489,JEREMY," No one's going to suspect anything. Why wouldn't I check on you? I mean, I'm the one who found you."
490,VICKI, You are?
491,JEREMY," Yeah, I carried you out of the woods."
492,VICKI, Thank you.
493,JEREMY," Yeah, you're welcome."
494,ELENA, Stefan? Stefan?
495,ELENA, I... I'm sorry for barging in. The door was... Open.
496,DAMON," You must be Elena. I'm Damon, Stefan's brother."
497,ELENA, He didn't tell me he had a brother.
498,DAMON," Well, Stefan's not one to brag. Please, come. I'm sure Stefan will be along any second."
499,ELENA, Wow. This is your living room?
500,DAMON," Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction. It's a little kitschy for my taste. I see why my brother's so smitten. It's about time. For a while there, I never thought he'd get over the last one. Nearly destroyed him."
501,ELENA, The last one?
502,DAMON," Yeah. Katherine, his girlfriend? Oh, you two haven't had the awkward exes conversation yet."
503,ELENA, Nope.
504,DAMON," Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now. Or maybe he didn't want to tell you because he didn't want you to think he was on the rebound. We all know how those relationships end. "
505,ELENA, You say it like every relationship is doomed to end.
506,DAMON," I'm a fatalist. Hello, Stefan."
507,STEFAN, Elena. I didn't know you were coming over.
508,ELENA," I know. I should have called, I just... "
509,DAMON," Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time. Isn't she, Stefan? You know, I should break out the family photo albums or some home movies. But... I have to warn you. He wasn't always such a looker."
510,STEFAN," Thank you for stopping by, Elena. Nice to see you."
511,ELENA," Yeah, I should probably go. It was nice to meet you, Damon."
512,DAMON," Great meeting you, too, Elena."
513,ELENA, Stefan? Stefan?
514,DAMON," Great gal. Whoo. She's got spunk. You, on the other hand, look pooped. Did you over-exert yourself today? Let me guess... hospital."
515,STEFAN, Someone had to clean up your mess.
516,DAMON," Well, were you successful? Did the powers of persuasion work? Remember, if you don't feed properly, none of those little tricks work right."
517,STEFAN, How long was Elena here?
518,DAMON," Were you worried, Stefan? Scared we may be doomed to repeat the past? Isn't that why you play your little game, ""I'm a high school human""?"
519,STEFAN, I'm not playing any game.
520,DAMON, Of course you are. We both know the closest you'll ever get to humanity is when you rip it open and feed on it.
521,STEFAN, What kind of game are you playing... Damon?
522,DAMON," Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?"
523,ELENA, He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.
524,JENNA," Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend. Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues or cheating issues. Or amphetamine issues. Jeremy? Jeremy, where were you?"
525,JEREMY," More stoner stories? Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool. And so that's... that's cool."
526,JENNA," Oh, no, no, no!"
527,JEREMY, Ow! Why? Why... why did you do that? 
528,JENNA, Listen up! Quit ditching class or you're grounded. No discussion.
529,JEREMY," Parental authority, I like it. Sleep tight."
530,VICKI, Matt. Mattie?
531,BONNIE," Tonight, night of the comet. "
532,ELENA, Would you like a program? 
533,BONNIE," He didn't call, huh?"
534,ELENA, Or text. But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff. We've never gotten to the texting part.
535,BONNIE, That's an important milestone in any relationship.
536,ELENA," Isn't it? The timing is wrong, anyway."
537,BONNIE, When is it ever right?
538,ELENA," I'm not ready, Bonnie."
539,BONNIE, Who is?
540,ELENA, At least I put myself out there.
541,BONNIE, Is that what you're calling it?
542,ELENA, What do you mean?
543,BONNIE, All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.
544,ZACH, What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?
545,STEFAN, 'Cause I came home. He wants to make my life miserable. That's how he enjoys his.
546,ZACH," Well, he's putting us all at risk. This girl in the hospital could talk."
547,STEFAN, She won't. I took care of her.
548,ZACH, You're sure?
549,STEFAN," I'm not sure, Zach. I don't know how well it worked. I'm not as strong as Damon."
550,ZACH, So what happens if it doesn't work?
551,STEFAN, I don't know. I'll deal with it.
552,ZACH," Is she worth it? Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for."
553,JEREMY," Vicki, what are you doing here?"
554,VICKI, Fighting with Robert about my schedule. You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal would merit an extra sick day. 
555,JEREMY, Are you feeling ok?
556,VICKI, I hurt.
557,JEREMY," Well, the doctor gave you something, right?"
558,VICKI," The kid stuff. Nothing with an ""o"" in it. I think they were onto me."
559,JEREMY," Here. Knock yourself out, literally."
560,VICKI," Thanks, Jer."
561,JEREMY," So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?"
562,VICKI, I hadn't really thought about it. But I could be talked into it. I'll meet you out there in a few.
563,TYLER," Hey, Vick. How you feeling?"
564,VICKI, Like you care.
565,TYLER," What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?"
566,CAROLINE," Hey, I got some candles."
567,ELENA, Hi. Hey.
568,MATT, Hey.
569,ELENA, Thank you.
570,MATT, You're welcome.
571,STEFAN, Thank you.
572,STEFAN, Hi.
573,ELENA, Hi.
574,STEFAN," You know, that comet... it's been traveling across space for thousands of years. All alone."
575,ELENA," Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil."
576,STEFAN," I think it's just a ball of... snow and ice, trapped on a path that it can't escape. And once every 145 years, it gets to come home. I'm sorry about yesterday. I wasn't myself."
577,ELENA, You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.
578,STEFAN," Well, I have a lot to apologize for. Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?"
579,ELENA, You didn't tell me that you had a brother.
580,STEFAN," We're not close. It's, uh... it's complicated."
581,ELENA," Always. He told me about your ex, Katherine."
582,STEFAN, What did he say?
583,ELENA, That she broke your heart.
584,STEFAN, That was a long time ago.
585,ELENA," When you lose someone, it stays with you, always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt."
586,STEFAN, Elena...
587,ELENA," It's ok, Stefan. I get it. You have no idea how much I get it. Complicated brother? Check. Complicated ex? Check. Too complicated to even contemplate dating, double check. It's ok. We met, and we talked, and it was epic, but... then the sun came up and reality set in so..."
588,VICKI, I know you.
589,DAMON," Well, that's unfortunate."
590,VICKI," Um... I don't... I don't know how, but... your face. Excuse me. Sorry."
591,JEREMY," Hey, has anyone seen Vickie?"
592,TYLER, You're her stalker. You tell us.
593,JEREMY, I can't find her.
594,TYLER," She probably found somebody else to party with. Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced."
595,ELENA, What's with the pill pusher?
596,TYLER, Ask him. 
597,JEREMY, You wanna do this right now?
598,ELENA, Are you dealing?
599,TYLER, She's never gonna go for you.
600,JEREMY, She already did. Over and over and over again.
601,TYLER," Yeah, right."
602,CAROLINE," You slept with Vickie Donovan? I mean, Vickie Donovan slept with you?"
603,TYLER, There's no way.
604,JEREMY, And I didn't even have to force her into it.
605,MATT," What the hell is he talking about, Todd?"
606,TYLER," Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk."
607,MATT," You know what, how about all of you shut up and help me find my sister?"
608,BONNIE, We'll check the back.
609,MATT, I'll check the square.
610,JEREMY, I'll come with you.
611,ELENA," Oh, no, no, no. You are coming with me. So that's your game now, dealing?"
612,JEREMY, I'm not dealing.
613,ELENA," Look, I'm sick of the tough love speech, Jer. It's really having no impact."
614,JEREMY," You and Jenna, between the two of you..."
615,ELENA, We can stop if you want. Send you to a therapist where you'll be forced to deal with it or to rehab where you'll sit in group and tell some stranger how you let your life fall apart. Or you could talk to me.
616,JEREMY, I vote for none of the above.
617,MATT, Hey.
618,STEFAN, Hey.
619,MATT, Have you seen my sister?
620,STEFAN," No, sorry. "
621,MATT, I can't find her. She's missing.
622,STEFAN, I'll keep an eye out for her.
623,MATT, Hey. I saw you at the hospital yesterday.
624,STEFAN, Did you?
625,MATT, What were you doing there?
626,STEFAN, Visiting.
627,MATT," Visiting? You know, Elena and I, we've known each other for a long time. We might not be together right now, but I look out for her. And I'll always look out for her."
628,DAMON, You really have to stop screaming.
629,VICKI," No, please, stop. Don't... Shh. I got you."
630,STEFAN, Excuse me.
631,VICKI, No! No!
632,DAMON, I gotta do it. I'm not gonna drop you. Not bad. Have you been eating bunnies?
633,STEFAN, Let her go.
634,DAMON, Shh. really? Ok.
635,VICKI," No! No, no, no!"
636,DAMON, Uhh! Relax.
637,VICKI, What's happening?
638,DAMON," I don't need her to be dead, but... you might. What attacked you the other night?"
639,VICKI, I don't know. An animal.
640,DAMON, Are you sure about that? Think. Think about it. Think really hard. What attacked you?
641,VICKI, A vampire.
642,DAMON, Who did this to you?
643,VICKI, You did!
644,DAMON, Wrong!
645,STEFAN, Don't.
646,DAMON, It was Stefan. 
647,STEFAN, Don't.
648,DAMON, Come here. Stefan Salvatore did this to you.
649,VICKI, Stefan Salvatore did this to me.
650,DAMON," He's a vampire. A vicious, m*rder monster."
651,STEFAN," Please, Damon. Please don't do this."
652,DAMON," If you couldn't fix it before, I don't know what you can do now."
653,VICKI, Aah! 
654,DAMON," Uhh! Your choice of lifestyle has made you weak. A couple of vampire parlor tricks is nothing compared to the power that you cod have, that you now need. But you can change that. Human bl*od gives you that."
655,VICKI, No!
656,DAMON," You have two choices. You can feed and make her forget. Or you can let her run, screaming ""vampire"" through the town square."
657,STEFAN, That's what this is about? You want to expose me?
658,DAMON, No! I want you to remember who you are!
659,STEFAN," Why? So what, so I'll feed? So I'll k*ll? So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again? You know what, let her go. Let her tell everyone that vampires have returned to Mystic Falls. Let them chain me up, and let them drive a stake through my heart, because at least I'll be free of you."
660,DAMON," Huh. Huh. Wow. Come here, sweetheart."
661,VICKI, No!
662,DAMON, It's ok.
663,VICKI," What happened? Where am I? Oh, I ripped my stitches open. Ah..."
664,STEFAN, You ok?
665,VICKI," I took some pills, man. I'm good."
666,DAMON," It's good to be home. Think I might stay a while. This town could use a bit of a wake-up call, don't you think?"
667,STEFAN," What are you up to, Damon?"
668,DAMON, That's for me to know and for you to... dot dot dot. Give Elena my best.
669,MATT, She said you found her wandering around.
670,STEFAN, Yeah.
671,MATT," So, um, thanks."
672,CAROLINE," Uhh, it's just so much drama. Ever notice how the druggies are the biggest attention whores?"
673,BONNIE, Yeah.
674,STEFAN, Excuse me. hi.
675,BONNIE, Hi. 
676,STEFAN," Um, have you guys seen Elena?"
677,BONNIE," I think she went home. I'm gonna give you Elena's cell number and her email. She is big on texting, and you can tell her... ""I said so""."
678,STEFAN, Thank you.
679,STEFAN, You ok?
680,BONNIE, What happened to you? That's so rude. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
681,CAROLINE," Yeah, she kind of wigs out. It's like her thing."
682,ELENA, Jer?
683,JENNA," No, it's me, the hypocrite patrol."
684,ELENA, What are you doing?
685,JENNA, I've become my worst nightmare. The authority figure who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy. Jackpot. I see the hiding places ven't gotten any more creative.
686,ELENA, What brought this on?
687,JENNA, Your ass-hat of a history teacher shamed me good yesterday.
688,ELENA, You got tannered. Been there.
689,JENNA," ""Discover the impossible, Ms. Summers."" Got it. Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up."
690,ELENA," You're not screwing up, aunt Jenna."
691,JENNA," Yes, I am. You know why? Because I'm not her. She made everything look so easy. You know, high school, marriage, having you. I can't do it. I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing, and he's gonna get worse, and it's gonna be my fault. It's impossible."
692,ELENA," This is just the fear talking. You're a little scared, that's all. We all are. I have to go do something. But are you going to be ok?"
693,CAROLINE, Oh... whoo.
694,DAMON, Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
695,CAROLINE," No, it's fine. Um... I was hoping I'd see you again."
696,DAMON, I know.
697,CAROLINE, Cocky much?
698,DAMON, Very much.
699,STEFAN, Hi.
700,ELENA, Hey.
701,STEFAN, Would you like to come in?
702,ELENA, The comet's actually this way. Sorry for barging in. Especially after earlier.
703,STEFAN," No, no. I'm glad you're here. The way we left things... I didn't like it."
704,ELENA," See, the thing is, I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do, write in my diary, like I have been since my mom gave me one when I was 10. It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling. It all goes in this little book that I hide on the second shelf behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid. But then I realized that I'd just be writing things that I should probably be telling you."
705,STEFAN, What would you write?
706,ELENA," I would write... ""Dear diary, today I convinced myself it was ok to give up. Don't take risks. Stick with the status quo. No drama, now is just not the time. But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses. All I'm doing is hiding from the truth, and the truth is that..."" I'm scared, Stefan. I'm scared that if I let myself be happy for even one moment that... the world's just going to come crashing down, and I... I don't know if I can survive that."
707,STEFAN," Do you want to know what I would write? ""I met a girl. We talked. It was epic. But then the sun came up and reality set in. Well, this is reality.Right here."""
708,CAROLINE, Aah!
709,DAMON, Good morning.
710,CAROLINE, Please... Don't.
711,DAMON," Don't do that. Ah, ah, ah."
712,CAROLINE, No! No! No! Get away from me! No!
713,DAMON, This could have gone a completely different way.
714,BONNIE, I'm not saying don't date the guy. I'm just saying take it slow.
715,ELENA, You were the one who said to go for it.
716,BONNIE, Now I'm saying take it slow.
717,ELENA, Why the about-face?
718,BONNIE, It's not an about-face. You're single for the first time in your entire high school career. It's the perfect time to play the field.
719,ELENA," Oh, because I'm so that girl. Seriously, what are you not saying?"
720,BONNIE, It's stupid.
721,ELENA, Bonnie...
722,BONNIE, What?
723,ELENA, Spit it out.
724,BONNIE, I accidentally touched Stefan. And got a really bad feeling.
725,ELENA, Is that it? Bonnie.
726,BONNIE, It was bad bad!
727,ELENA, Is the whole witch mojo thing again?
728,BONNIE, You know what? I'm just concerned. This is me expressing concern about my best friend's new boyfriend.
729,ELENA," And I love you for it, I do. But I feel good. It's been a hard year, and I'm starting to kind of feel like things are getting back to normal again. And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that."
730,VICKI, I rock. I scored 2 tickets to the Posers Saturday night. They're playing at the Rat.
731,JEREMY, You and Tyler have fun.
732,VICKI, Don't be like that. Come on. I want you to go.
733,JEREMY," You're not worried everyone's going to know you're screwing the stoner geek? Oh, wait... everyone already knows."
734,VICKI," Yeah. But it's not like that anymore, so now we can be friends and just hang."
735,JEREMY," Tell me something, was it the drugs? Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?"
736,VICKI, Screw you.
737,JEREMY," No, if there's another reason, please, I'm all ears."
738,STEFAN," Good morning, Elena. Good morning, Bonnie."
739,BONNIE," Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline. She's not answering her phone. So I'll see you guys later."
740,ELENA," Bonnie, wait..."
741,STEFAN, She doesn't like me very much.
742,ELENA," She doesn't know you. She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me. But when she does, she will love you."
743,TYLER," Look... there's Elena and her new boyfriend. Now, what are they doing? Oh, they're walking, walking, walking. Yep. Right into the sunset."
744,MATT, You're a dick.
745,TYLER, While you just stand there looking like one of those little yard trolls.
746,MATT, Gnomes.
747,ELENA, Here's what we're going to do. Are you free tonight?
748,STEFAN, Yes.
749,ELENA," Perfect. Dinner, my house. 8:00. You, me, and Bonnie. You two will spend some quality time and she'll get to see what a great guy you are. Mission accomplished."
750,MATT," Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty? She made her choice."
751,TYLER, Let her know she made the wrong one.
752,MATT," What are you doing? Ty, don't. Ty, don't! Ty! Don't!"
753,ELENA, That throw was insane. I didn't know you played football.
754,STEFAN, I used to. It was a long time ago.
755,ELENA, So why don't you try out for the team?
756,STEFAN," Yeah, I don't think so."
757,ELENA, So you don't like football?
758,STEFAN," No, I love football. I think it's a great sport. But in this case, I don't think football likes me. You saw Tyler over there, and we both know how Matt feels."
759,ELENA," They don't know you. To them, you're mysterious loner guy. Wouldn't hurt to be part of. Make some friends. "
760,STEFAN, Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
761,ELENA," Hey, come on. There's more to me than just gloomy graveyard girl. There's a whole other Elena that you have yet to meet. She was into everything, very busy."
762,STEFAN," Well, I look forward to meeting her. And when will that be?"
763,ELENA, Soon. She's working on it.
764,TANNER, World w*r II ended in... Anyone got anything? Miss Juan? 1945.
765,ELENA, Psst. Fyi... Our team sucks. They could use you.
766,STEFAN, Can't.
767,TANNER, Pearl Harbor.
768,STEFAN, I'm a loner.
769,TANNER, Miss Gilbert?
770,ELENA, Hmm? Pearl Harbor?
771,TANNER, Um...
772,STEFAN," December 7, 1941."
773,TANNER," Thank you, Miss Gilbert. "
774,STEFAN, Anytime. 
775,TANNER, Very well. The fall of the Berlin wall.
776,STEFAN," 1989. I'm good with dates, sir."
777,TANNER, Are you? How good? Keep it to the year. Civil Rights Act.
778,STEFAN, 1964.
779,TANNER, John F. Kennedy assassination.
780,STEFAN, 1963.
781,TANNER, Martin luther King.
782,STEFAN, '68.
783,TANNER, Lincoln.
784,STEFAN, 1865.
785,TANNER, Roe vs. Wade.
786,STEFAN, 1973.
787,TANNER, Brown vs. Board.
788,STEFAN, 1954.
789,TANNER, The battle of Gettysburg.
790,STEFAN, 1863.
791,TANNER, Korean w*r.
792,STEFAN, 1950 to 1953.
793,TANNER, Ha! It ended in '52.
794,STEFAN," Uh, actually, sir, it was '53."
795,TANNER," Look it up, somebody. Quickly."
796,STUDENT, It was 19... 53.
797,ELENA, How did you know all of that?
798,STEFAN, Years and years of crossword puzzles. It's a loner thing.
799,MATT, Nice job! Nice job!
800,TANNER," Mr. Lockwood, is there anything you're good at? 'Cause it isn't history, and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!"
801,TYLER," Yes, coach."
802,TANNER, Now do it again!
803,BONNIE," Oh, my God! You're here!"
804,ELENA," Yep. I can't be sad girl forever. The only way to get things back to the way they were are to do things that were. Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight."
805,BONNIE, I am?
806,ELENA," Mm-hmm. You, me and Stefan. You have to give him a chance."
807,BONNIE, Tonight's no good. Have you seen Caroline? I texted her like a hundred times.
808,ELENA," Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett. You're going to be there."
809,BONNIE, Fine. I'll go.
810,ELENA, Good.
811,TANNER," Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore."
812,STEFAN," I wasn't here then, sir."
813,TANNER," And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned."
814,STEFAN," Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I didn't get off to the best start, And I want to apologize for that. I've played football before. Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good."
815,TANNER," Well, I won't be asking you who won the super bowl in '71."
816,STEFAN," '71 was the... Sorry. I... I understand that, sir."
817,TANNER, Just to see you get knocked on your ass. Borrow some gear. Go! Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!
818,MATT," First my girlfriend, now the team?"
819,TYLER," Dude, this is an opportunity. Football's a contact sport. Sometimes people get hurt. Whoo! Ha ha!"
820,BONNIE," Seriously, where is Caroline?"
821,ELENA, I don't know. It's not like her. Try her again.
822,ELENA, Uh...
823,BONNIE," Oh, my God. That must be the mystery guy from the grill."
824,ELENA, That's not a mystery guy. That's Damon Salvatore.
825,BONNIE," Salvatore, as in Stefan?"
826,CAROLINE," I got the other brother. Hope you don't mind. Sorry I'm late, girls. I, uh, was busy. All right, let's start with the double pike herkey hurdler, what do you say? And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today? Ok? Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top. And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8."
827,MATT," Blue lady! Blue lady! Set, hut! Go! Come on, Tyler, cover it! Let's do it."
828,TANNER, Get it.
829,MATT, Line up!
830,MATT," I hate to say it, but he's got k*ll."
831,TYLER, I think he needs a buddy pass.
832,MATT, Really? You don't get to walk on the field and act like you own the place after 5 minutes.
833,TYLER, Just hang one up there and I'll take care of the rest.
834,TANNER, Do it again.
835,MATT," All right, let's huddle up. Set, hut!"
836,TYLER," Oh! Whoo! Welcome to the team, buddy."
837,TANNER," You gonna live, Salvatore?"
838,STEFAN, Yeah.
839,TANNER," Walk it off, son."
840,MATT, Hey. That was my bad.
841,STEFAN, It's all right.
842,MATT, Hey.
843,TANNER, All right.
844,DAMON," How were tryouts? Did you make the team? Very Emerson, the way you reveal your soul with so many... Adjectives."
845,STEFAN, What are you doing here?
846,DAMON," I've come to apologize. I've been doing some thinking, some soul searching, and... I want us to start over. We need to put the past behind us. You're my little brother, and if you want to live a normal, happy human life, then I want that for you. Maybe I can do it, too. That I can learn to be a non-living living person. Maybe there's hope for both of us."
847,STEFAN," You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon."
848,DAMON," Of course it doesn't. I saw Elena today, btw. That means ""by the way."" She was at cheerleading practice. She looked so perky in her little short shorts. Just... simmer down, I didn't even go near her. I've got my own cheerleader now. Ooh, that reminds me... I gotta run. I have a date. Sweaty palms. Wish me luck."
849,BONNIE," You explain it. Last night, I'm watching Nine-o, a commercial breaks come on and I'm like, I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough, it's that guy and the girl with the bench, he flies to Paris and he flies back. They take a picture. "
850,ELENA," Oh, come on. That commercial's on a constant loop."
851,BONNIE," Fine. Well, how about this? Today I'm obsessed with numbers. 3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22. How weird is that?"
852,ELENA, Maybe we should play the lottery. Have you talked to your grams?
853,BONNIE, She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch. I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?
854,ELENA, I don't want to be a witch.
855,BONNIE, And putting it in a nice bowl isn't fooling anybody.
856,ELENA," Ok, serving spoons. Where are the serving spoons?"
857,BONNIE, Little drawer on your left.
858,ELENA," Ok, so you've been in this kitchen like a thousand times."
859,BONNIE," Yeah, that's it."
860,ELENA," Ok, he's here. Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self."
861,BONNIE, Birthday candles.
862,ELENA, Did Tanner give you a hard time today?
863,STEFAN," Well, he let me on the team, so I must have done something right."
864,ELENA," Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today. Tyler threw a ball right at him, and... "
865,BONNIE," Yeah, I heard."
866,ELENA, Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?
867,BONNIE," Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad. Hmm."
868,ELENA," No, about the witches. Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches. It's really cool."
869,BONNIE, Cool isn't the word I'd use.
870,STEFAN," Well, it's certainly interesting. I'm not too versed, but I do know that there's a history of celtic druids that migrated here in the 1800s."
871,BONNIE, My family came by way of Salem.
872,STEFAN, Really? Salem witches?
873,BONNIE, Yeah.
874,STEFAN, I would say that's pretty cool.
875,BONNIE, Really? Why?
876,STEFAN, Salem witches are heroic examples of individualism and nonconformity.
877,BONNIE," Yeah, they are."
878,ELENA, I wonder who that could be.
879,CAROLINE," Surprise! Bonnie said you were doing dinner, so we brought dessert."
880,ELENA, Oh. 
881,DAMON, Hope you don't mind.
882,STEFAN, What are you doing here?
883,DAMON, Waiting for Elena to invite me in.
884,ELENA," Oh, yeah, you can... "
885,STEFAN," No, no, no. He can't, uh... he can't stay. Can you, Damon? "
886,CAROLINE, Get in here. 
887,STEFAN, We're just... finishing up.
888,ELENA, It's fine. Just come on in.
889,DAMON," You have a beautiful home, Elena."
890,ELENA, Thank you.
891,CAROLINE, I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team. Tyler must be ceiling. But good for you. Go for it.
892,DAMON, That's what I always tell him. You have to engage. You can't just sit there and wait for life to come to you. You have to go get it.
893,CAROLINE," Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today. It's only because you missed summer camp. God, I don't know how you're ever going to learn the routines."
894,BONNIE, I'll work with her. She'll get it.
895,CAROLINE, I guess we can put her in the back.
896,DAMON," You know, you don't seem like the cheerleader type, Elena."
897,CAROLINE," Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died. Yeah, I mean, she's just totally going through a blah phase. She used to be way more fun. And I say that with complete sensitivity."
898,DAMON," I'm sorry, Elena. I know what it's like to lose both your parents. In fact, Stefan and I have watched almost every single person we've ever cared about die."
899,STEFAN," We don't need to get into that right now, Damon."
900,DAMON," Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up. Mmm."
901,VICKI, Don't do that. Not while I'm working. I'll see you later. 
902,TYLER, I'll be right back.
903,MATT," She's my sister and I love her, but sometimes she can really make you work for it."
904,JEREMY, I find it pretty easy.
905,JERMEY," All right, I get it. Hitting me to impress her. That's... That's real nice."
906,TYLER, I don't need to impress her. I already won. Now you're dead.
907,JEREMY, Am I? 'Cause it seems like I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.
908,MATT," Ty, don't!"
909,TYLER," The next time I see you, Gilbert..."
910,JEREMY," No, next time I see you."
911,MATT," What are you doin', Vick?"
912,DAMON, One more.
913,ELENA," Oh, thank you. Nice save."
914,DAMON," I like you. You know how to laugh. And you make Stefan smile, which is something I haven't seen in a very long time."
915,ELENA," Earlier, did you mean... Katherine?"
916,DAMON, Mm-hmm.
917,ELENA, How did she die?
918,DAMON, In a fire. Tragic fire.
919,ELENA, Recently?
920,DAMON," Well, it seems like it was yesterday."
921,ELENA, What was she like? 
922,DAMON," She was beautiful. A lot like you in that department. She was just very complicated and selfish and at times not very kind, but very sexy and seductive."
923,ELENA, So which one of you dated her first?
924,DAMON, Nicely deduced. Ask Stefan. I'm sure his answer differs from mine. I'd quit cheerleading if I were you. 
925,ELENA, Why do you say that?
926,DAMON," Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable."
927,ELENA, You saw that?
928,DAMON, Uh-huh.
929,ELENA, I used to love it. It was fun. Things are different this year. Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.
930,DAMON," So don't let it. Quit, move on. Problem solved. Ta-da."
931,ELENA, Some things could matter again.
932,DAMON, Maybe. But... seems a little unrealistic to me.
933,ELENA," I'm sorry. About Katherine. You lost her, too."
934,BONNIE, Hey. Need some help?
935,DAMON," Sure, why not?"
936,CAROLINE," Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time. You have to understand that they were each other's first. You know, like, from the sandbox."
937,STEFAN, That's a really nice scarf.
938,CAROLINE," Mm. Thank you, it's new."
939,STEFAN," Can I see it? I mean, would you mind taking it off?"
940,CAROLINE," Oh, I can't."
941,STEFAN, Why not? You ok?
942,CAROLINE, Um... All I know is that I can't take it off.
943,DAMON, What are you two kids talking about?
944,STEFAN, I was just commenting on her scarf.
945,DAMON," Hmm. Hey, you know, um, Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes. Why don't you go see if you can help?"
946,CAROLINE, Does it look like I do dishes?
947,DAMON, For me?
948,CAROLINE, Hmm... I don't think so.
949,DAMON, Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.
950,CAROLINE, You know what? I'm gonna go see if Elena needs some help in the kitchen.
951,DAMON, Great.
952,STEFAN," They are people, Damon. She's not a puppet. She doesn't exist for your amusement, for you to feed on whenever you want to."
953,DAMON, Sure she does. They all do. They're whatever I want them to be. They're mine for the taking.
954,STEFAN," All right, you've had your fun. You used Caroline, you got to me and Elena, good for you. Now it's time for you to go."
955,DAMON," That's not a problem. Because... I've been invited in, and I'll come back tomorrow night and the following night and I'll do with your little cheerleader whatever I want to do. Because that is what is normal to me. "
956,ELENA, Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.
957,STEFAN, Hmm. That makes one of us.
958,ELENA, Come on. Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...
959,STEFAN, There must be a shred of humanity left inside my brother. Somewhere. I keep hoping. But how do I make him see it? And how do I protect her?
960,ELENA, Ooh. Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.
961,STEFAN, What happened? No more cheerleader?
962,ELENA, I quit. I'm a quitter.
963,STEFAN," No, hey, you're not a quitter. You suffered a great loss. You're not the same person. You should be looking ahead. You should be starting over. Ok? I hope you don't think this is too soon or too weird, but... I, uh, I wanted you to have this."
964,ELENA," Oh, my God, it's beautiful."
965,STEFAN," It's something that I've had forever, and, uh, I've never wanted to give it to anyone until now. I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me, for... good luck."
966,ELENA, Is that rose that I smell?
967,STEFAN," No, it's, uh... it's an herb. It's nice, huh?"
968,ELENA, I love it.
969,STEFAN," And, uh, I wanted to thank you for pushing me to try out for the team. It feels really good."
970,ELENA," We're a pair. I quit, you start."
971,STEFAN, Right. We're a work in progress. We'll figure it out.
972,CAROLINE, And you're not in uniform because...
973,TANNER," Wait, wait, wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Let's be honest here. In the past, we used to let other teams come into our town and roll right over us! But that is about to change. We've got some great new talent tonight starting on the offensive line, and I'm gonna tell you right now, it has been a long time since I have seen a kid like this with hands like these. "
974,TYLER, This blows. He can't start the guy. He just got here.
975,TANNER," That have been waiting for us to put a check in the win column, I have only one thing to say to you... Your Timberwolves are hungry."
976,VICKI," Hey, you. What's wrong?"
977,TYLER, Nothing. 
978,TANNER, And the central high lions are what's for dinner!
979,TYLER, Is that Jeremy?
980,VICKI," Wait, no! Ty! No."
981,TYLER," Oh, what do you care? Don't look so down. You can have her when I'm done."
982,VICKI," Tyler, stop it! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Stop it! Stop, you're hurting him! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Tyler! Stop it! Tyler, stop!"
983,STEFAN," Hey, he's down! Enough!"
984,ELENA," Jeremy, no!"
985,MATT, Get off me! Stop!
986,ELENA," What the hell, Jeremy? Put your head up, you're bleeding."
987,JEREMY, I'm fine!
988,ELENA," Yeah, you smell fine."
989,JEREMY," Just stop, ok?"
990,MATT," Come on, man. Come on."
991,ELENA," Oh, my God, your hand."
992,STEFAN," No, no, no, it's fine."
993,ELENA, Is it deep? How bad is it? Come on!
994,ELENA," But... I saw it, it was... "
995,STEFAN, He missed. It's not my bl*od. See? I'm fine.
996,ELENA," No, no, no. I... I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was... "
997,STEFAN," It's ok. I'm ok. It's almost kick-off time, all right? So, um, I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game."
998,CAROLINE," Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly. Can you stand straight, please? Could someone please help Tiki?"
999,BONNIE, Hey! Where you been?
1000,ELENA, Can I ask you a question and you give me a really serious no-joke response?
1001,BONNIE, Of course. What is it?
1002,ELENA, The bad mojo. When you touched Stefan and you had that reaction...
1003,BONNIE," You know what, forget I said that. Your little dinner party plot totally won me over."
1004,ELENA," No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it? Did you see something, Or..."
1005,BONNIE," It wasn't clear like a picture. Like today, I keep seeing those same numbers I told you about... 8, 14, 22. "
1006,ELENA, Yeah? 
1007,BONNIE," When I touched Stefan, it was a feeling. And it vibrated through me, and it was cold, and it... "
1008,ELENA, And what?
1009,BONNIE, It was death. It's what I imagine death to be like.
1010,ELENA, You scared me. What are you doing here?
1011,DAMON, I'm hiding from Caroline.
1012,ELENA, And why is that?
1013,DAMON, I needed a break. She talks more than I can listen.
1014,ELENA, That could be a sign.
1015,DAMON," Well, she's awfully young."
1016,ELENA, Not much younger than you are.
1017,DAMON, I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture. I think she'd drive me crazy.
1018,ELENA," Caroline does have some really annoying traits, but we've been friends since the first grade and that means something to me."
1019,DAMON, Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. That's not my intention.
1020,ELENA," Yes, it is. Otherwise you wouldn't put an alternate meaning behind everything you say."
1021,DAMON," You're right. I do have other intentions, but so do you."
1022,ELENA, Really?
1023,DAMON, Mm-hmm. I see 'em. You want me.
1024,ELENA, Excuse me?
1025,DAMON, I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me. You think about me even when you don't want to think about me. I bet you even dreamed about me. And right now... You want to kiss me.
1026,ELENA," What the hell? I don't know what game you're trying to play with Stefan here, but I don't want to be part of it. And I don't know what happened in the past, but let's get one thing straight... I am not Katherine."
1027,MATT, You gonna be able to play?
1028,STEFAN," Oh, yeah, I'm good."
1029,MATT," Uh, what you did back there... you had Jeremy's back."
1030,STEFAN," Ah, he's a messed-up kid. Somebody's gotta look out for him."
1031,MATT, I know. This week at practice I was a dick. 
1032,STEFAN, Had your reasons.
1033,MATT, No excuse. Good luck tonight. We're lucky to have you.
1034,DAMON," Isn't that nice? Stefan joins a team, makes a friend. It's all so, ""rah, rah, go team, yeah!"""
1035,STEFAN, Not tonight. I'm done with you.
1036,DAMON," Nice trick with Elena. Let me guess... vervain in the necklace? I admit, I was a bit surprised. It's been a while since anyone could resist my compulsion. Where'd you get it?"
1037,STEFAN, Does it matter?
1038,DAMON, Guess I could just seduce her the old-fashioned way. Or I could just... eat her.
1039,STEFAN," No. You're not gonna hurt her, Damon."
1040,DAMON, No?
1041,STEFAN," Because deep down inside, there is a part of you that feels for her. I was worried that you had no humanity left inside of you, that you may have actually become the monster that you pretend to be."
1042,DAMON, Who's pretending?
1043,STEFAN, Then k*ll me.
1044,DAMON," Well, I'm... I'm tempted."
1045,STEFAN," No, you're not. You've had lifetimes to do it, and yet, here I am. I'm still alive. And there you are. You're still haunting me. After 145 years. Katherine is dead. And you hate me because you loved her, and you torture me because you still do. And that, my brother, is your humanity."
1046,TANNER, Salvatore! What the hell? We've got a game to play!
1047,DAMON, If that's my humanity... then what's this?
1048,TANNER, Aah!
1049,STEFAN, No!
1050,DAMON," Anyone, anytime, any place."
1051,TYLER, Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.
1052,MATT," Don't talk to me right now, all right? I'm pissed at you."
1053,TYLER, What's your problem?
1054,MATT," What's my... You're my problem, all right? You're a bully. A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man. And I'm sick of it. I mean, what was that about tonight? What's b*at up the new guy going to prove? Or screwing with my sister or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother."
1055,TYLER," Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but she dumped your ass. Are you for real?! You want to hit me? I'm on your team."
1056,MATT, This was over the line. Even for you.
1057,MATT, Somebody help!
1058,VICKI, It wasn't just for the drugs.
1059,ELENA, What kind of animal could be doing all this? Why would it come out of the woods and attack someone in the middle of town?
1060,STEFAN, I don't know. I don't know.
1061,ELENA, I was so sure that you cut your hand. I saw it.
1062,STEFAN," I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine, ok? We're fine. That's what matters."
1063,STEFAN," I thought there was hope that somewhere deep inside, something in Damon was still human, normal. But I was wrong. There's nothing human left in Damon. No good, no kindness. No love. Only a monster Who must be stopped."
1064,ELENA, Hello? Jeremy? Hello?
1065,MAN ON TV," This is Logan Fell coming to you live from the streets of Mystic Falls with breaking news of another deadly animal attack. The wild animal terrorizing the citizens of Mystic Falls has claimed another v*ctim, local high school student Elena Gilbert. Police are certain that forensic eviden will confirm that this is the same animal responsible for recent attacks."
1066,DAMON, You know it's coming next.
1067,STEFAN, Ah!
1068,DAMON, Bad dream?
1069,STEFAN, Ah.
1070,DAMON, Do you know how easy it was to get into your head just now? You really need some human bl*od. It might even the playing field. Football reference. Too soon.
1071,DAMON," All right, I deserved that. But I just wanted to let you know, they caught the culprit. The animal responsible for k*ll coach tanner and all those people."
1072,STEFAN, What are you talking about?
1073,DAMON," It was a mountain lion. Really big one. It attacked a hunter this morning. It's all over the news. ""Deadly beast captured. All's well in Mystic Falls."""
1074,STEFAN, Why would you cover your tracks?
1075,DAMON, I've decided to stay a while. I'm just having way too much fun here with you and Elena.
1076,STEFAN, Can't touch her now.
1077,DAMON," Well, the vervain keeps me out of her head. Maybe that's not my target. Believe it or not, Stefan, some girls don't need my persuasion. Some girls just can't resist my good looks, my style and my charm and my unflinching ability to listen to Taylor Swift."
1078,DAMON," This is John Varvatos, dude. Dick move."
1079,SHERIF ON TV, I can confirm that a 12-Foot puma mountain lion attacked a hunter and was subsequently sh*t and k*ll. The hunter is in stable condition. 
1080,STEFAN," The real animal is still out there, waiting for me, challenging me to fight back, to stop him. But how do I stop a monster without becoming one myself?"
1081,MAN ON TV," To repeat, the animal terrorizing Mystic Falls has been caught."
1082,JENNA, Scum ball. Scum bucket.
1083,ELENA, Who are you talking to?
1084,JENNA," Him. The news guy, also known as Logan ""Scum"" Fell. Did your mom ever tell you why I moved away from Mystic Falls?"
1085,ELENA," Oh, no way. You and him? He's cute."
1086,JENNA, He is not cute. There's nothing cute about him. What are you doing with that?
1087,ELENA, I went yesterday and got it from the safe deposit box. Mom had told Mrs. Lockwood she would loan it to the founder's council for their heritage display. Is that grandma beth's wedding ring?
1088,ELENA, Originally it was great-Great-Grandma mary's wedding ring.
1089,JEREMY," How much do you think this stuff is worth? You know, like on ebay?"
1090,ELENA, You're not gonna find out.
1091,JEREMY, That stuff is mom and dad's. You can't just give it away.
1092,ELENA," I'm not giving it away. It's called a loan, Jeremy."
1093,STEFAN, Hi.
1094,ELENA, Hi.
1095,ELENA, Are you ok?
1096,STEFAN, I'm good. Sorry.
1097,ELENA, Maybe we should press pause.
1098,STEFAN," Yeah, you're probably right. That was getting a bit..."
1099,ELENA, Yeah.
1100,STEFAN, Yeah.
1101,ELENA, How do you look in a suit?
1102,STEFAN, I can pull one off.
1103,ELENA, How about tomorrow night? Will you be my date to the founder's party?
1104,STEFAN, They still do that?
1105,ELENA, Have you been before?
1106,STEFAN," No, the Salvatores don't get invited anymore."
1107,ELENA," Well, this year, there's this heritage project that meant a lot to my mom. She was really involved in the founder's council, and it was her favorite party. I know it sounds really boring, but--"
1108,STEFAN," I would be honored to accompany you, Miss Gilbert."
1109,ELENA," The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Salvatore."
1110,DAMON, No yellow. Jaundice. Go for the blue.
1111,CAROLINE, I don't like the blue.
1112,DAMON," Well, I do. And if I'm gonna be your date-- "
1113,CAROLINE," You cannot be my date. My mother is going to be there, and she is a very proud g*n owner."
1114,DAMON, I went through a lot of trouble to make sure this party wasn't cancelled. It's very important I be there. Please take me.
1115,CAROLINE, You should come to the founder's party with me.
1116,DAMON, Not if you're wearing that dress. At's so special about this Bella girl? Edward's so whipped.
1117,CAROLINE, You gotta read the first book first. It won't make sense if you don't.
1118,DAMON," Ah, I miss Anne Rice. She was so on it."
1119,CAROLINE, How come you don't sparkle?
1120,DAMON," Because I live in the real world, where vampires burn in the sun."
1121,CAROLINE," Yeah, but you go in the sun."
1122,DAMON, I have a ring. It protects me. Long story.
1123,CAROLINE, These bites turn me into a vampire?
1124,DAMON," It's more complicated than that. You'd have to feed on my bl*od, then die, then feed on a human's, whole ordeal. This book, by thwawa has it all wrong."
1125,CAROLINE, You can be very sweet when you want to be.
1126,DAMON," Yes, I can be sweet. "
1127,CAROLINE, Are you going to k*ll me?
1128,DAMON, Mm-Hmm. But not yet.
1129,CAROLINE, Why not?
1130,DAMON, Because there's something I need you to do for me.
1131,CAROLINE, Anything.
1132,DAMON, How good are you at getting this little nose Where it doesn't belong?
1133,CAROLINE," Oh, I'm excellent."
1134,DAMON, Mmm.
1135,MR LOCKWOOD, So what happens with the season? One big forfeit? Are they looking for a new coach?
1136,TYLER," I don't know, dad. I doubt anybody's thinking about that right now."
1137,MRS LOCKWOOD," Charles, founder's party, focus."
1138,VICKI, How are y'all doing over here?
1139,MR LOCKWOOD," Ah, we're doing great, sweetheart."
1140,VICKI, Is there anything else I can get you?
1141,TYLER," We're fine, thanks."
1142,MR LOCKWOOD," Just the check, honey."
1143,VICKI," Here you go, Mayor Lockwood."
1144,MR LOCKWOOD, Thanks.
1145,BONNIE, You're taking Damon to the founder's party? What about me?
1146,CAROLINE, Go with Elena.
1147,BONNIE, She's asking Stefan.
1148,CAROLINE," Ok, go by yourself."
1149,BONNIE," Gee, thanks. What about your mom? Is she ok with you bringing Damon?"
1150,CAROLINE, And I'm supposed to care why?
1151,BONNIE, He's older sexy danger guy.
1152,CAROLINE, Older sexy danger guy? Is that an official witch twitter tweet?
1153,BONNIE," No more witch jokes, ok? At whole Mr. Tanner prediction thing has me freaked."
1154,CAROLINE," Ok. And Damon's not dangerous. You know, he just has a lot of issues with his brother. You know, like major, deep-Rooted drama."
1155,BONNIE, Like...?
1156,CAROLINE, I'm not really supposed to say anything.
1157,BONNIE," Caroline Forbes, when have you ever kept a secret in your life?"
1158,CAROLINE, Ok. But you can't tell Elena.
1159,BONNIE, No.
1160,TYLER, So what you gonna buy me?
1161,VICKI," Ugh, some class. Oh, your parents are gone. I guess can bebclose now."
1162,TYLER, What the hell does that mean?
1163,VICKI, You treat me like trash. I'm sick of it.
1164,TYLER, I don't think you're trash.
1165,VICKI, Really? Then who are you taking to the founder's party?
1166,TYLER, Vicki Donovan. Do you want me to ask you to the founder's party?
1167,VICKI, No. It'll be stupid and lame.
1168,TYLER, True. But it'll be less stupid and lame if you were there.
1169,JEREMY," You realize you had to ask him to ask you, right? You figure if you dress up like a respectable young lady, he'll finally treat you like one?"
1170,VICKI," Screw you, jeremy."
1171,JEREMY," You know you're making the wrong choice, yet you make it anyway. It's sad."
1172,ZACH, I didn't know you were here.
1173,DAMON," Just going through Stefan's homework. Boy, this country sure has dumbed down in the last hundred years. Why he wants to go to high school is beyond me. I mean, in the seventies, he went Ivy League. Harvard, I understood. Actually, no. I didn't get that either. Go ahead, purge. Get it out. What's on your mind?"
1174,ZACH," Why are you here, Damon?"
1175,DAMON," To spend time with you, Zach. Family's important."
1176,ZACH," I know you. You always have a motive. So tell me, what is it this time?"
1177,DAMON, You are in no position to question me.
1178,ZACH, I didn't mean to upset you.
1179,DAMON," This is not upset, Zach."
1180,STEFAN, What's going on?
1181,DAMON," Having a family moment, Stefan. Spending some quality time."
1182,STEFAN," Hey, are you ok?"
1183,ZACH," No, I'm not. And neither are you. How many more people have to die before you see that?"
1184,STEFAN," I see it. All right, Zach, I see it."
1185,ZACH, Then why aren't you doing anything about it?
1186,STEFAN," I can't, Zach. I can't. It would take human bl*od. It's the only way that I could stop him, and I can't do that."
1187,ZACH, The vervain could weaken him if he ingested it. It would help get you the upper hand.
1188,STEFAN," Vervain hasn't grown here since 1865. Damon saw to that. The little I had, I gave to Elena. What?"
1189,STEFAN, You've been growing it.
1190,ZACH, It's just something that's been passed down through the generations. bl*od only runs so deep when you're related to vampires. Damon would k*ll me if he knew that I had it.
1191,STEFAN, But you're telling me. Why?
1192,ZACH, Because I trust you. And you're gonna need it if you want to get rid of him.
1193,TYLER, I'm here for my mom. I was supposed to pick up a box of stuff.
1194,ELENA, Right here. Please be careful.
1195,JEREMY," Yeah, careful with it, dick."
1196,ELENA," Hey! Not now, ok, guys? Please?"
1197,TYLER, I'm fine. He's just being a punk.
1198,JEREMY, I got your punk.
1199,ELENA," Look, Tyler, maybe you should go. Tell your mom that I'll see her tonight."
1200,TYLER, Hey. Would it make a difference if I told you I actually like Vicki?
1201,JEREMY, Not even if you meant it.
1202,BONNIE, Delicate flower vs. Naughty vixen. 
1203,ELENA, Tough call. Can we mix them?
1204,BONNIE," Look at you, getting all pretty for your date. You seem happy-Ish."
1205,ELENA, I am...ish. Tonight's going to be a good night. But don't let that stop you from telling me whatever it is you wanted to tell me as soon as you walked in the door.
1206,BONNIE, What if I tell you in the morning? I don't want to ruin the night.
1207,ELENA," Bonnie, out with it."
1208,BONNIE," Ok, but it has to go in the vault, because Caroline will k*ll me if it gets back to Damon that she squealed. Apparently Stefan has a very interesting back story."
1209,ELENA, Uh-Huh.
1210,BONNIE, Do you know what happened with his ex-girlfriend Katherine?
1211,ELENA, I know that they both dated her and that's why they have issues.
1212,BONNIE," Yeah, they both dated her, only she chose Damon. And that drove Stefan mad, he did horrible things to try and break them up. He manipulated Katherine. He filled her head with all these lies until finally it worked, and she turned against Damon."
1213,ELENA," That sounds like one person's side of the story, meaning Damon's."
1214,BONNIE, I just wanted you to know.
1215,ELENA," Anyway, his past relationships are none of my business."
1216,BONNIE," Unless he's a calculating, manipulative liar. That is your business."
1217,ELENA, Stefan is none of those things.
1218,BONNIE, Yeah? How do you know?
1219,DAMON, Do they still wear ties at this thing?
1220,STEFAN, Why are you even going?
1221,DAMON," It's only fitting. We were at the very first one, remember?"
1222,STEFAN, I think it's better if we don't draw attention to ourselves.
1223,DAMON, So you should stay here. I'll see to it Elena has a good time.
1224,STEFAN," My goodness, I've driven you to drink. Can't seem to rid myself of you. What else am I supposed to do, besides go about living my life?"
1225,DAMON," Go about living my life. See, therein lies your eternal struggle. You're dead, dude. Get over it."
1226,STEFAN, What do you think?
1227,ELENA," Hello? Hi, Mrs Lockwood. What do you mean? It is? Are you sure? 'Cause I saw it. Let me check. Mm-Hmm. I will find it and bring it. Ok. Bye."
1228,BONNIE, What's wrong?
1229,JEREMY," Ahh! God, what now? "
1230,ELENA, The pocket watch. Where is it?
1231,JEREMY, What watch?
1232,ELENA," The one you stole from mom's box. Look, Mrs Lockwood just called me, freaking out. It was on the list, Jeremy. And she can't find it, and she thinks she's the one who lost it."
1233,JEREMY, Maybe she did. Maybe Tyler took it.
1234,ELENA," Don't even play that card. Jeremy, you took it. If I go online, am I going to find it on ebay? Is that how you pay for your pot?"
1235,JEREMY," Screw you. I would never sell this, ok?"
1236,ELENA, Then why did you take it?
1237,JEREMY," Because it's supposed to be mine. Dad said it goes to the firstborn son. His father gave it to him, and now what?"
1238,ELENA, And he was going to give it to you.
1239,JEREMY, Yeah.
1240,ELENA," Look, Jeremy, it's still yours, ok? Mom promised Mrs Lockwood. What do you want me to do?"
1241,JEREMY, Just take it and get out.
1242,DAMON, It's cool not growing old. I like being the eternal stud.
1243,STEFAN," Yes, being a 150-Year-Old teenager Has been the height of my happiness."
1244,DAMON," You cracked a funny, Stefan. I should have a drink to celebrate. 1864. You and Katherine were the perfect couple. It was hell watching you dance with her."
1245,STEFAN," My happiness was short-Lived, as you well know."
1246,DAMON," I remember. I left the party early, I was waiting for her. The night you dropped her off, I was waiting just inside. You were such a gentleman, gave her a kiss on the cheek. And what she really wanted was... Oh, well. Here's to history repeating itself, huh?"
1247,DAMON," I admire your effort, Stefan. Pouring yourself a drink then spiking the bottle with vervain."
1248,STEFAN, I'm not some drunk sorority chick. You can't roofie me. But I can't help but feel a little used. I thought we were having a moment. I have to go to the party angry. Who knows what I'll do?
1249,VICKI, Hi. How are you?
1250,TYLER," Uh, let's go this way."
1251,VICKI, Why?
1252,TYLER," Line's too long. We can go around back. Come on, party's in the back."
1253,ZACH," That was his favorite scotch. I'm sorry, I thought it would work."
1254,STEFAN, I wasn't counting on it.
1255,ZACH, You knew it would fail?
1256,STEFAN, Did what I wanted. It lowered his guard. You won't expect me to try again so soon.
1257,ZACH, I doubled what I put in the scotch.
1258,MRS LOCKWOOD, Caroline! You look smashing.
1259,CAROLINE," Thank you, Mrs Lockwood. This is my boyfriend Damon."
1260,MRS LOCKWOOD," Oh, well, come on in."
1261,DAMON, Lovely to meet you. I've been looking forward to this party for quite a while.
1262,MRS LOCKWOOD," Well, enjoy."
1263,CAROLINE, Wait here.
1264,CAROLINE," Really, you couldn't even change out of the badge for this?"
1265,SHERIF FORBES," I'm working, honey. Who's the date you just tried to sneak past me?"
1266,CAROLINE, Just some guy.
1267,SHERIF FORBES," He's a little old for you, don't you think?"
1268,CAROLINE," Oh, 'cause otherwise you'd approve. Yeah, I doubt that."
1269,ELENA," Hi, mayor Lockwood."
1270,MR LOCKWOOD," Hey. Hey, guys, on in."
1271,STEFAN, Thank you.
1272,SHERIF FORBES, Where's your dad?
1273,CAROLINE, Memphis.
1274,SHERIF FORBES, Good. 
1275,CAROLINE, With Stephen.
1276,STEFAN, Your parents?
1277,ELENA, There's a lot of history here.
1278,LOGAN, Jenna.
1279,JENNA, Hello Logan.
1280,LOGAN, It's good to see you.
1281,JENNA, I thought I might see you here.
1282,LOGAN, You knew it.
1283,JENNA, I dreaded.
1284,LOGAN, But were secretely hoping.
1285,JENNA, And now that I have...
1286,LOGAN," Whoa, hey, not so fast. I know you. You have a lot more insults in you, I can tell."
1287,JENNA, Your hairline's receding.
1288,LOGAN," No, it's not. You want to have lunch?"
1289,JENNA, Nope.
1290,LOGAN, You haven't changed a bit.
1291,JENNA," Oh, yes, I have. I'm meaner now."
1292,ELENA," ""The founding families in Mystic Falls welcomes you to the inaugural founder's council celebration."" Wow, look, it's the original guest registry. Look at all these familiar names-- Sheriff William Forbes, Mayor Benjamin lockwood. Is that Damon Salvatore? And, look, Stefan Salvatore."
1293,DAMON," The original Salvatore brothers. Our ancestors. Tragic story, actually."
1294,STEFAN, We don't need to bore them with stories of the past.
1295,ELENA," It's not boring, Stefan. I'd love to hear more about your family."
1296,CAROLINE," Well, I'm bored. I want to dance. And Damon won't dance with me."
1297,DAMON, Mm-Mmm.
1298,CAROLINE, Could I just borrow your date?
1299,ELENA," Oh, uh..."
1300,STEFAN, I don't really dance.
1301,DAMON," Oh, sure he does. You should see him. Waltz, the jitterbug, the moonwalk. He does it all. "
1302,CAROLINE," You wouldn't mind, would you, Elena?"
1303,ELENA, It's up to Stefan.
1304,DAMON," I want to apologize to you for being such a world-Class jerk the other night when I tried to kiss you. There's no excuse. My therapist says I'm... Acting out, trying to punish Stefan."
1305,ELENA, For what?
1306,DAMON, It's all in the past. I don't even want to bring it up. Let's just say that the men in the Salvatore family have been cursed with sibling rivalry. And it all started with the original Salvatore brothers.
1307,STEFAN, Damon told you to ask me to dance. Didn't he?
1308,CAROLINE, Now why would he do that?
1309,STEFAN, Would you like one?
1310,CAROLINE," Ok, just tell me if you see my mom."
1311,DAMON, The Salvatore name was practically royalty in this town. Until the w*r. There was a battle here--
1312,ELENA, The battle of willow creek.
1313,DAMON, Right. 
1314,ELENA," I know, we talked about it in class. Confederate soldiers fired on a church with civilians inside."
1315,DAMON," What the history books left out was the people that were k*ll. They weren't there by accident. They were believed to be union sympathizers. So some of the founders on the confederacy side back then wanted them rounded up and b*rned alive. Stefan and Damon had someone they loved very much in that church. And when they went to rescue them, they were sh*t. m*rder in cold bl*od."
1316,ELENA, Who was in the church that they wanted to save?
1317,DAMON," A woman, I guess. Doesn't it always come down to the love of a woman?"
1318,ELENA," Look, I'm sorry that you and Stefan have this thing between you, but I can't get in the middle of it, Damon. I just... I hope you two can work it out."
1319,DAMON," I hope so, too."
1320,VICKI, So you want to dance?
1321,TYLER, Me dancing? Not pretty.
1322,VICKI," Maybe you could show me around. I mean, this place is amazing."
1323,TYLER," Yeah, if you like living in a museum."
1324,VICKI, Maybe I should just strip naked and give pastor bill
1325,TYLER, I don't care about what they think.
1326,VICKI, Great. Let's go say hi.
1327,TYLER," Knock it off, vick."
1328,VICKI," Or we could just, you know, sneak up to your bedroom. As long as nobody sees us, right?"
1329,TYLER," Vicki, I swear..."
1330,VICKI," What's a matter, Ty? You scared to stand up to your mommy? It's pretty pathetic."
1331,TYLER, Let go!
1332,MRS LOCKWOOD," Tyler... We didn't get a chance to say hello earlier. It's Vicki, right? Matt's sister."
1333,VICKI," Yes, madame."
1334,MRS LOCKWOOD, You'll have to forgive my son's rudeness. He gets it from his father.
1335,VICKI," Well, that's ok, Mrs Lockwood. Tyler and I were just saying good night."
1336,MRS LOCKWOOD, That's what you get when you bring the trash into the party.
1337,DAMON, What'd we miss?
1338,CAROLINE, We were just chatting.
1339,STEFAN," Drink, Damon?"
1340,DAMON," No, thanks, I'll pass."
1341,ELENA," Stefan, do you have another dance in you?"
1342,STEFAN, Absolutely.
1343,CAROLINE, They look so cute together.
1344,DAMON," Don't talk, please."
1345,LOGAN, Don't sh**t! I'm going to need a refill.
1346,JENNA, sh**ting implies caring.
1347,LOGAN, Feigned indifference. I like it.
1348,JENNA," I'm over the banter, Logan. I'd really rather you just left me alone."
1349,LOGAN," I'm sorry, Jenna. About your sister."
1350,JENNA, Thank you.
1351,LOGAN, Came to the funeral.
1352,JENNA, I know. I saw you.
1353,LOGAN," Yeah, I didn't want to push my way in, but I wanted to be there for you. And when I heard you were staying in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe... Well, maybe I could have a second chance to make things right."
1354,JENNA," Her name was Monica, wasn't it?"
1355,STEFAN, I hope Damon didn't drive you too crazy.
1356,ELENA," No, actually, he was on good behavior. He even apologized and explained why he is the way he is. And it all goes back to Katherine."
1357,STEFAN, Hmm.
1358,ELENA, So tell me about her. What happened?
1359,STEFAN, It's not something I like to talk about.
1360,ELENA," I get that. I do. I just want you to know that you can. I mean, I burden you with all of my drama, and I want you to do the same."
1361,STEFAN, I know. Thank you.
1362,ELENA," The truth is, Stefan... I don't really know that much about you, and I'd really love it if you would open up to me."
1363,STEFAN," Damon said something, didn't he? He likes to play games and cause trouble, Elena."
1364,ELENA," This isn't about Damon, it's about me trying to get to know you. Look, you're the mystery guy, and I like that. But with mystery comes secrets, and this thing with Katherine."
1365,STEFAN, Let it go. I don't want to talk about it.
1366,ELENA," Well, then, say something about yourself. Anything. Otherwise, I'm left with nothing but what other people tell me."
1367,STEFAN, Don't you see what Damon has done here? He's trying to get you to turn against me.
1368,ELENA," Well, then I guess it's working."
1369,BONNIE, This is my fault. I planted doubt. I'm a doubt planter.
1370,ELENA," It's not your fault. I just-- I feel terrible because I said that I wouldn't get in the middle of it, and that's exactly what I did. I got all snotty."
1371,MRS LOCKWOOD," Elena, honey, there you are. I notice the watch still isn't in the collection."
1372,ELENA," Oh, um, I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood. I, um, I couldn't find it. I guess it's still packed up in my parents' stuff somewhere."
1373,MRS LOCKWOOD," I see. Well, please let me know if you do find it."
1374,ELENA, Ok.
1375,CAROLINE, Where have you been?
1376,DAMON, Ah. Looking for you.
1377,CAROLINE, Your brother barely danced with me for five minutes--
1378,DAMON," Ok, just a minute. Stand right...there."
1379,CAROLINE," Um, you're not supposed to touch. What is that?"
1380,DAMON, It's a very important crystal.
1381,CAROLINE," Well, how did you know that it was there?"
1382,DAMON, Because I put it there.
1383,CAROLINE, When?
1384,DAMON," A long time ago. Tonight, I'm taking it back, thanks to you."
1385,CAROLINE," Well, what's it for?"
1386,DAMON, Never you mind.
1387,CAROLINE, You can't just steal it.
1388,DAMON, It's not stealing if it's mine. Come on. Well...
1389,LOGAN," Vodka tonic. Ok, I know that this is probably going to be strike 3, but I hope you can see it for what it is."
1390,JENNA, And what is it?
1391,LOGAN," Persistence. Groveling, commitment. Take your pick."
1392,JENNA, I fled town because of you. Fled.
1393,LOGAN," I was young and stupid, and then things changed. Life got...real. You'd know that better than anyone."
1394,JENNA," Hypothetically speaking, if allowed, how would you make things right?"
1395,LOGAN," Well, more groveling, of course. A recap of the past few years spent soul searching. Cheese fries."
1396,JENNA, Obvious.
1397,LOGAN, I know my audience.
1398,JENNA, Yes to lunch. Call me.
1399,MRS LOCKWOOD," Look around. What's missing? The flames, the candles. Why aren't they lit? There's matches in the kitchen."
1400,BONNIE, Bitch.
1401,ELENA, Hey.
1402,CAROLINE, Hey. So how are things with Stefan?
1403,ELENA, Great. Just great.
1404,CAROLINE," Really? Well, my radar must be off, 'cause I was getting all sorts of other vibes..."
1405,ELENA, What is that?
1406,CAROLINE, Hmm? Don't!
1407,ELENA," Oh god, Caroline, what happened?"
1408,CAROLINE," Nothing, ok?! That is nothing."
1409,ELENA, Did somebody hurt you?
1410,CAROLINE," No, ok, nothing. It just... My mom would k*ll me."
1411,ELENA, Did Damon hurt you?
1412,CAROLINE," No! Of course not! Just leave me alone, ok, Elena?!"
1413,ELENA," God! There is something seriously wrong with you. You stay away from Caroline or I will go straight to her mother, the sheriff. You got it? Stay away from her."
1414,ELENA, I'm sorry. I take it all back. You're completely right about Damon.
1415,STEFAN, What did he do?
1416,ELENA," There are bruises all over Caroline's body. Bite marks, and he has her all confused and messed up in the head. You don't look surprised."
1417,STEFAN, Um... I'm handling it.
1418,ELENA," Handling it? Stefan, you should be having him arrested."
1419,STEFAN," Elena, please. I... I don't expect you to understand."
1420,ELENA," I don't understand anything, Stefan. So why don't you just clear it up for me?"
1421,STEFAN," Look, there are things that you don't know, ok? Things that I want to tell you, but I can't. And I may never be able to. And I just need you to trust me."
1422,ELENA, Trust is earned. I can't justagically hand it over.
1423,STEFAN, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
1424,JEREMY, You look amazing. What are you doing here?
1425,VICKI, I was thinking maybe I could make one more wrong choice today. I still have 17 minutes.
1426,CAROLINE," Don't! She took it off and I got flustered, ok?! I didn't know what to say. But I swear, ok, I did not tell her. I just told her that you didn't mean to hurt me."
1427,DAMON," You make me crazy, you know that?"
1428,CAROLINE, It's ok. I forgive you. I swear I didn't say--
1429,DAMON," Shh, shh, shh. Unfortunately... I am so over you now."
1430,DAMON, What the hell?
1431,STEFAN," You know, I couldn't spike your drink... So I spiked hers."
1432,ELENA, Caroline? There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Are you ok?
1433,CAROLINE, Yeah. I'm fine.
1434,ELENA," Caroline, what happened?"
1435,CAROLINE, I'm fine.
1436,ELENA, No. You're shaking. Caroline--What-- 
1437,CAROLINE, I'm fine!
1438,ELENA," Caroline, come here, come here."
1439,STEFAN," I did what I had to do... To protect Elena, to protect everyone. Yes, Damon, the headline reads ""Deadly beast captured. All is well in Mystic Falls."""
1440,MR LOCKWOOD, Thank you for staying so late.
1441,SHERIF FORBES, Did you get the Gilbert watch?
1442,MRS LOCKWOOD, She claims it's packed away in her parents' things.
1443,LOGAN, I can get it.
1444,SHERIF FORBES, Good. We're going to need it.
1445,MR LOCKWOOD, Are you sure?
1446,SHERIF FORBES, 5 bodies all drained of bl*od? I'm certain. 
1447,LOGAN, They've come back.
1448,DAMON, Where is my ring?
1449,STEFAN, Won't be needing it anymore.
1450,DAMON, How long have I been here?
1451,STEFAN, Three days. 
1452,DAMON, What are you doing?
1453,STEFAN," During the dark ages when a vampire's actions threatened to expose or bring harm upon the entire race, they would face judgment. They sought to reeducate them rather than to punish them. "
1454,DAMON, You know what will happen if i don't... Feed on bl*od.
1455,STEFAN," You'll grow weaker and weaker. Eventually you won't be able to move or speak. In a week your skin will desiccate, and you'll mummify. A living corpse. Unable to hurt anyone. Ever."
1456,DAMON," So what, you're just going to leave me in the basement, forever?"
1457,STEFAN," I've injected you with enough vervain to keep you weak. Once your circulation stops, I'll move you to the family crypt, and then in 50 years, we can reevaluate."
1458,DAMON, I'm stronger than you think.
1459,STEFAN, You always have been. But you're not stronger than the vervain. And we both know it. I'm sorry. Didn't have to be this way.
1460,VICKI," I--i'm sorry, i'm almost done."
1461,ELENA, It's--it's ok. Take your time.
1462,VICKI, I think you might be in trouble.
1463,JEREMY, What did you do?
1464,VICKI," Oh, she saw me."
1465,JEREMY, I'm a drug-using delinquent. A girl in bed doesn't really rank.
1466,ELENA, Jenna! Are you aware of what's going on upstairs?
1467,JENNA, Uh-huh.
1468,ELENA, And you have no objection?
1469,JENNA," He could be craftier about it, at least make an effort to sneak her in and out. Oh, and just so you know, I won't be home for dinner."
1470,ELENA," Oh, so you're actually going to do it. You're gonna go out with Logan."
1471,JENNA," I'm going to show up and torture him, yes. And have you heard from Stefan?"
1472,ELENA," Not since that very vague message three days ago. ""Hi, um, Elena, I, um, have something I have to do. I'll, uh, explain in a few days."""
1473,JENNA, Haven't you called him?
1474,ELENA," Nope. Not going to, either."
1475,JENNA, And you're ok with everything?
1476,ELENA," No, I'm not ok with any of it. But I'm not gonna cry about it, either. You know, I was going to write in my diary this morning and then I thought, what am I going to write? Honestly, i'm not gonna be onee of those pathetic girls whose world stops spinning because of some guy."
1477,JENNA," Ok, then."
1478,ELENA, I'll be fine.
1479,STEFAN," He's awake. He's aweak, but it's probably best to stay out of the basement. He's Damon. I'm not sure how dangerous he still might be. "
1480,ZACH, You're going to school?
1481,STEFAN," Came here to live a life. It's about time i get back to that. And Elena, if she's still speaking to me."
1482,ZACH, Why haven't you called her?
1483,STEFAN," Am suppose to do, feed her another lie? I hate lying to her, Zach. I'm not good at it. She already thinks I'm hiding something."
1484,ZACH, What choice do you have? You came here because you wanted to live as normal a life as you could. You knew this was going to be a part of it.
1485,CAROLINE," I remember the party. Damon came up behind me, and he was kissing my neck, or biting my neck. I passed out. It's like there's holes in my memory lately. It's just weird. Maybe I let him bite me."
1486,BONNIE, Why would you do that?
1487,CAROLINE," Can we just not talk about it, ok? Don't want to talk about Damon. I don't want to talk about any of it. Just want to go back to normal. What are you doing with that candle?"
1488,BONNIE, Um... Nothing. What's this?
1489,CAROLINE," Damon gave it to me. Or he was going to give it to me. All i know is, it's mine now."
1490,BONNIE, It's ugly.
1491,CAROLINE," Well, get your hands off it."
1492,CAROLINE," The sexy suds car wash is tomorrow. The football team and the band have committed. Well, not all the band. Just the ones who could pull off the bikini. I want, in your face, sexy. I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake."
1493,ELENA, Unbelievable. It's like nothing happened.
1494,BONNIE, Lies and denial.
1495,STEFAN, Hey.
1496,BONNIE," Hey. You know, I gotta go. Be somewhere right now."
1497,STEFAN, I'm so sorry I haven't called.
1498,ELENA, No worries. I'll live.
1499,STEFAN, I was dealing with Damon.
1500,ELENA, And did you... deal with Damon?
1501,STEFAN, Yes. Yeah.
1502,ELENA, For four days?
1503,STEFAN, You have every right to be upset with me. But can I explain it all to you? Please.
1504,ELENA, Sure. When?
1505,STEFAN," I gotta be home after school, but The Grill, on four o'clock?"
1506,ELENA, Ok. 
1507,STEFAN, Thanks.
1508,CAROLINE," Stefan, where is Damon? He has some serious apologizing to do."
1509,STEFAN," He's gone, Caroline."
1510,CAROLINE, When is he coming back?
1511,STEFAN, He's not coming back. I'm sorry.
1512,ELENA," This is a good thing, Caroline."
1513,CAROLINE, I know that.
1514,ELENA," Hey, Matt, um, have you seen Stefan?"
1515,MATT," Nope. If you want to k*ll some time, um, you can rack. Come on. We haven't played in forever. I'll let you brick."
1516,ZACH, I'm full of vervain. I've been putting it in my coffee for 16 years. My bl*od will only make you worse. Damon?
1517,DAMON, So it was your vervain. Good for you. Good for you. Family only runs so deep.
1518,ZACH," We're not family, Damon. Only in the most dysfunctional sense. In fact, I avoided having a living, breathing, loving family because of you."
1519,DAMON, I don't guess I could talk you into bringing me a rabbit or something? I'd settle for Stefan's diet at this point.
1520,ZACH, You know i can't do that.
1521,DAMON," You succeeded, Zach. I'm shutting down. You're like your grandfather. He didn't like it when I came to visit, either."
1522,ZACH," But you don't visit, Damon. You appear, unannounced, reminding me that this isn't my house; that you're just permitting me to live here. Hell, that you're permitting me to live."
1523,DAMON, Someone had to mow the lawn.
1524,ZACH," I came to say good-bye, Damon."
1525,DAMON," Unlock it. Unlock the door, Zach."
1526,STEFAN," Keep it up, Damon. The more energy you expend, the faster you'll go."
1527,ELENA," And there's Vicki, all nonchalant in the bathroom like it's no big deal that they're hooking up."
1528,MATT," Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. Your brother and my sister, that's weird."
1529,ELENA, Yeah.
1530,MATT, How late is he?
1531,ELENA, Hitting the hour mark. Hope there's nothing wrong. Which means I'm not talking boy problems with you.
1532,MATT," Good. I mean, it's not like we were ever best friends or anything."
1533,ELENA, Ok. Here goes-- What do you think of Stefan? Is he a good guy?
1534,MATT, Why? what's he done?
1535,ELENA," Not any one thing. He's just so secretive all the time. I think there's something that he doesn't want me to know, which makes me want to know all the more."
1536,MATT, Like what? like that he's a serial k*ll and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?
1537,ELENA," No, of course not. But what do we know about him, really?"
1538,MATT," He's great at football. A little bit of a loner. And as much as I hate saying it, he might be a nice guy."
1539,ELENA, So you think I'm just being paranoid?
1540,MATT, I think you should talk to him.
1541,STEFAN, talk to who? I'm so sorry that I'm late.
1542,ELENA, What happened?
1543,STEFAN, I got held up.
1544,ELENA, Is everything ok?
1545,STEFAN, There was this thing with my uncle. 
1546,ELENA, And you couldn't call and tell me that you were going to be an hour late?
1547,MATT, Ok. You two have fun.
1548,STEFAN, I'm really sorry. It was unavoidable.
1549,ELENA, What was unavoidable? Ok.
1550,STEFAN," Oh, uh, Elena, please..."
1551,ELENA," No, Stefan, don't you get it? Every question gets a vague non-answer. What is so awful that you're afraid to tell me?"
1552,OLD MAN, I know you. My god.
1553,STEFAN, I'm sorry?
1554,OLD MAN, I know you. How can it be?
1555,STEFAN," I think you have the wrong person, sir."
1556,OLD MAN, You haven't aged a day.
1557,STEFAN," I'm sorry. excuse me. Hey, can we-- can i take you home and we can talk about it? Is that ok?"
1558,ELENA," Wait, what was that?"
1559,STEFAN," I--i don't know. uh, nothing."
1560,ELENA," Right, nothing. Ok, um... I gotta go, Stefan. Excuse me."
1561,ELENA," I tried. I want so much to make things right, but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful. What you don't know can hurt you."
1562,LOGAN," Evening, Sheriff. Anything?"
1563,SHERIFF FORBES," We went over the entire west side of the lake. All the caverns by the falls were clean, no signs of habitat."
1564,LOGAN," Well, they're staying in town."
1565,SHERIFF FORBES, We canvassed all abandoned buildings and warehouses. 
1566,LOGAN, There has to be a private residence.
1567,SHERIFF FORBES," And that much harder to locate, if not impossible. These creatures are smart. they know how to go undetected."
1568,LOGAN," Well, someone who only comes out at night should eventually become obvious."
1569,SHERIFF FORBES, What about the watch?
1570,LOGAN, I'm working on it. 
1571,SHERIFF FORBES, I knew the Gilberts. That watch is passed down to the men in the family. I'd start with Jeremy.
1572,JENNA," Hey, Logan. "
1573,LOGAN, I can't believe you really came.
1574,JENNA, You have an hour.
1575,LOGAN, Make it count.
1576,JEREMY, You ok?
1577,ELENA, Is Vicki in there?
1578,JEREMY, Don't answer a question with another question. Maybe. What's wrong with you?
1579,ELENA, I'm miserable.
1580,JEREMY," Well, you should go get something to eat."
1581,ELENA, Jenna? Jenna? Stefan? What are you doing here?
1582,STEFAN," Dinner. Jeremy told me that chicken parmesan is one of your favorites, and I happen to be a good cook. The italian roots demand it. I can even make my own homemade mozzarella. Only tonight, it is unfortunately storboht. Sorry."
1583,ELENA, I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.
1584,STEFAN," You want to know me, right? Well, I figure if you're going to dump me, you should at least, um, know who you're dumping. So let's start with Katherine."
1585,ELENA, Stefan...
1586,STEFAN," She was... the most beautiful girl that I had ever met. She had this perfect olive skin. And she had this laugh. It was ridiculous. I mean, her laugh made you laugh. And she was fun. She knew how to have a good time. But Katherine was also very impatient and entitled and selfish, and, um, and impulsive. Enter Damon. He claims that he was with her first. I don't know. I do know that I did some things that...i'm not proud of. And my biggest regret... Is not being able to make it right before she died. I miss her, but... I'm no longer crippled by her loss."
1587,VICKI, It was very nice what you did for Stefan. Very romantic.
1588,JEREMY," Well, I was feeling romantic."
1589,VICKI," Look what i found. ""Elena Gilbert, take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as needed for pain."""
1590,JEREMY, Those are left over from the car accident.
1591,VICKI, So she won't miss them.
1592,JEREMY," No not with that, that's an antique. I feel like we're always getting high."
1593,VICKI, That's the beauty of choice.
1594,JEREMY," Well, then let's choose not to. I mean, we don't have to be high all the time, right?"
1595,VICKI," I really hope you're not one of those guys who, now that we're together, tries to change everything about me."
1596,JEREMY, No.
1597,VICKI, Good.
1598,STEFAN," I'm an avid reader, a huge fitzgerald fan, ""The great gatsby"", his masterpiece.But I'm no snob. I love some good Grisham. I think Seinfeld is the best american television show for the past 50 years, but i love Lucy is all-time. ""The loving cup"" episode was the best, I think. Huge Scorsese fan. I can watch Taxi Driver over and over again."
1599,ELENA," Here, let me."
1600,STEFAN," As far as music, it's pretty much across the board. Um, Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie. Oh, Kanye. You know what, i even like that one miley song. Easy."
1601,ELENA," I didn't say anything. Hey, this is for the garlic bread, right? Because I'm not eating garlic unless you agree to, too."
1602,STEFAN, Are you kidding? I love garlic.
1603,ELENA, Ow! ahh.
1604,STEFAN, You ok? um...
1605,ELENA, Yeah. Think so. Your face...
1606,STEFAN," I--i, uh, I think i got something in my eye."
1607,ELENA," Stefan. Hey. Stefan! Um, I think that my paranoia has turned into full-blown hallucinations."
1608,STEFAN, Part of your charm.
1609,DAMON, Caroline. Caroline.
1610,CAROLINE," No, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, ok? I've seen it on you. trust me. Yeah, but you're going for stripper pole vibe this year."
1611,DAMON, Caroline.
1612,CAROLINE," Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion. No."
1613,DAMON, Caroline.
1614,CAROLINE," What? oh, um, no, sorry. Um, so i'll just see you tomorrow. Two-piece. Ok, bye."
1615,CAROLINE," Shoo, shoo! Shoo! God!"
1616,DAMON," I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself, aren't you?"
1617,STEFAN, Not particularly.
1618,DAMON," You won. You got the bad guy. Now nothing could come between you and Elena. Except the truth. The lies will catch up to you, Stefan. As long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are. "
1619,STEFAN, The beauty of you in there and me out here... Is that i can walk away.
1620,CAROLINE," No friend discounts. No freebies. No pay ya laters. We are not running a charity here. No, we are not."
1621,STEFAN, Hi.
1622,ELENA, Hey!
1623,CAROLINE," The event is called sexy suds, you know."
1624,STEFAN, Did we just get scolded?
1625,ELENA," And judged, yeah."
1626,STEFAN, Wow.
1627,ELENA," I'm sorry, but i guess you're going to have to take that off."
1628,STEFAN, I think you have to go first.
1629,ELENA," Ok. Ok, um--sorry, So not sexy. Ugh."
1630,STEFAN, I disagree.
1631,BONNIE," uh-uh, no. None of that tortured pining stuff."
1632,MATT, I'm just observing.
1633,BONNIE, Mm-hmm. Oh. Tiki. this one's yours.
1634,TIKI," Why do i always get the homely os? Just to be clear, your car's a p.o.s. I mean, we can wash it, but it's still a p.o.s. "
1635,BONNIE, You don't have to be rude.
1636,TIKI, Rude is uglying up the road with that junk.
1637,TIKI, Whoa! What the hell ?
1638,MATT," Wet and wild, Tik."
1639,LOGAN, All proceeds are going to the school's athletic department still healing from the tragic death of their football coach William Tanner. The citizens of Mystic Falls coming together in support of one of their own. Cut it.
1640,JENNA, Classy.
1641,LOGAN, Thank you.
1642,JENNA," But you're still going to video the girls in bikinis, right?"
1643,LOGAN," We, 53% of americans watch the news with the sound off."
1644,JENNA, Thank you for dinner. I had a nice time.
1645,LOGAN, Do you remember the last time we were in the school parking lot?
1646,JENNA, Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
1647,LOGAN, Really?
1648,JENNA, Nada. Especially not having sex in the minivan.
1649,LOGAN, That was a good day. What?
1650,ELENA, You're getting soap in that.
1651,STEFAN," Oh, it's fine."
1652,ELENA," I noticed at Damon has one, too. Is there a story behind it?"
1653,STEFAN," Yeah, it's the family crest from the italian renaissance."
1654,ELENA, Hmm. What's the stone?
1655,STEFAN, It's called lapus lazuli.
1656,ELENA, Oh. You should really take it off. I could put it in my bag.
1657,STEFAN," No, it's-- it's fine, really. Thanks, though."
1658,ELENA, Ok. I'm gonna get some towels.
1659,STEFAN, Ok.
1660,ELENA," Hey, we're out of towels and those shimmy things."
1661,CAROLINE, I'll go get some more. Mind the money.
1662,DAMON," Caroline. Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me. Help me."
1663,ELENA," That'll be $20. I saw you last night. You were talking to a friend of mine, At the grill?"
1664,OLD MAN," Well, i--i thought it was somebody i knew."
1665,ELENA, Stefan Salvatore.
1666,OLD MAN," Nah, it can't be. It's just my mind"
1667,ELENA, Playing tricks on me. Where do you think you'd seen him before?
1668,OLD MAN," When i first moved here, I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house."
1669,ELENA, Oh.
1670,OLD MAN," Stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle. I mean, none of us knew he was even here until the attack."
1671,ELENA, The attack?
1672,OLD MAN, His uncle got k*ll. Mauled by an animal in the woods.
1673,ELENA," His uncle, Zach?"
1674,OLD MAN, Mm-mmm. Joseph.
1675,ELENA," I'm sorry, sir. I don't think I'm familiar with the story."
1676,OLD MAN," Oh, how could you? I mean, this happened years ago."
1677,TIKI," Grandpa, you gotta go. mom wants you home. Ok? "
1678,OLD MAN, Ah. 
1679,TIKI," He wasn't bugging you, was he? He's a little alzy-heimer."
1680,ELENA," No, he was sweet. Hey, sir, I'm sorry. Um, are you sure that the man that you saw, that you knew, his name was Stefan Salvatore?"
1681,MAN, Yes. I remember his ring and his brother--
1682,ELENA, Damon?
1683,MAN, Yeah. Stefan and Damon Salvatore.
1684,ELENA, When was this?
1685,MAN," It was early June, 1953. Yeah. June, 1953."
1686,STEFAN," Caroline finally freed you, huh?"
1687,ELENA," Uh, i don't know where she went. She abandoned me. Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea that your family was from italy."
1688,STEFAN, No? Last name Salvatore didn't do it for you?
1689,ELENA, Right. Duh. Are there any other Salvatores in Mystic Falls?
1690,STEFAN, My uncle Zach.
1691,ELENA, Where did everyone else go?
1692,STEFAN, Kinda just spread out.
1693,ELENA, Hmm.
1694,STEFAN, Why?
1695,ELENA, I'm just trying to learn more about you.
1696,STEFAN, Hmm.
1697,JEREMY, Where are you taking me?
1698,VICKI, We can't hide out in your room all the time. Welcome to my other favorite party place.
1699,JEREMY," What, a cemetery?"
1700,VICKI," Yeah. It's cool, huh?"
1701,BOY," Yo, Vick!"
1702,VICKI," What's up, Jared?"
1703,BOY," You baby-sitting, Donovan?"
1704,VICKI, This is Jeremy. he's cool.
1705,BOY, Smoke up.
1706,JENNA, Your car was done an hour ago. You're saying that out loud why?
1707,LOGAN," Hi. Elena, right? I think i met you once when you were 9."
1708,ELENA, Oh.
1709,JENNA, Your emotional maturity level when we were together.
1710,LOGAN, Ouch. Here i thought we were making progress.
1711,ELENA, Is he enough in your good graces that i can ask him for a favor?
1712,LOGAN," If i do her a favor, will i get back in your good graces?"
1713,JENNA," Uh, a very reluctant maybe to both."
1714,LOGAN," Done. Wait. One condition. Dinner, tonight, your house."
1715,JENNA, Fine. But you're eating leftovers.
1716,LOGAN, Ooh. What do you need?
1717,ELENA," Do you have access to old news stories, say, fifties?"
1718,LOGAN," Yeah, at the station. Between the ariveses and the internet, we pretty much have everything."
1719,ELENA, I have this report way past due. It'd be a life saver.
1720,LOGAN, Heading there now. Let's go.
1721,ELENA," If anyone asks, you don't know where I went. I don't want Caroline to know that i left."
1722,DAMON," Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me."
1723,CAROLINE," Damon? Damon? Damon? Oh, my god! What is this? How did i know that you were here?"
1724,DAMON," Because I wanted you to. Very, very badly. Let me out of here. Please."
1725,CAROLINE, You bit me.
1726,DAMON, You liked it. Remember?
1727,CAROLINE," Why do I keep remembering the same things, but in different ways?"
1728,DAMON," You remember what I want you to remember. And now that the vervain has passed out of your system, you won't remember what you're about to do."
1729,CAROLINE, What am I about to do?
1730,DAMON, You're gonna open the door. You're gonna open the door.
1731,ZACH, No! No! Get out of here. Run! Run!
1732,TIKI, Sweeper duty.
1733,BONNIE, What?
1734,TIKI, We have to clean the pavement.
1735,BONNIE," It's a car wash. By definition, the pavement's clean."
1736,TIKI, But not dry.
1737,BONNIE, And I'm doing this why?
1738,TIKI," Caroline bailed, so that leaves me in charge. Fabulous."
1739,STEFAN, Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey.
1740,BONNIE, What just happened?
1741,STEFAN, You were in some kind of a trance.
1742,BONNIE, Did I do this?
1743,STEFAN," I think so, yes."
1744,BONNIE," Nobody else saw, did they? Don't tell anybody. Please."
1745,LOGAN, We digitized all our archives last year. You can pull all the remote footage right up on screen. What is it exactly you're looking for?
1746,ELENA," An incident from 1953, If it even happened-- At the old Salvatore boarding house."
1747,LOGAN," Sorry, one second. Yeah? All right, be right there. I gotta go. You believe there's actual news to cover in this town? All right, use keywords to search the database. It's pretty easy to navigate. And Brady down in tech will help you out with anything you need."
1748,ELENA, Ok.
1749,LOGAN," All right? Oh, hey. Could you put in a good word for me with Jenna?"
1750,ELENA, You got it.
1751,LOGAN, All right. Good luck.
1752,VICKI, What?
1753,VICKI," They don't mind, they're dead. Let me take this up a notch. Hey, Tony."
1754,TONY, Oh! Nice. Vickies from vicki. Ha!
1755,GIRL," Well, thank you, Elena Gilbert, whoever you are."
1756,JEREMY, You took those from the house?
1757,VICKI, She wasn't hung it.
1758,JEREMY, She's gonna notice if they're gone. That's not cool.
1759,VICKI," It's no big deal, Jer."
1760,JEREMY," Yeah, it kinda is, Vick."
1761,BOY," Damn, dude."
1762,TONY, Vicki brought the party police.
1763,VICKI," Shut up, Tony. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad."
1764,JEREMY," Well, what are we doing, partying in a cemetery with a bunch of losers?"
1765,VICKI, Those are my friends.
1766,JEREMY, They're waste of space small-town lifers.
1767,VICKI, Yeah? What am i?
1768,JEREMY," You're different, Vick."
1769,VICKI," No, you are. You're the kid with the big house who's acting out because his parents died. Guess what-- You'll get over it. You will pull yourself together, move on, and one day tell your kids stories about your dark period growing up. And i'll still be here, waiting tables at the grill, partying at the cemetery with a bunch of waste of space small-town lifers."
1770,JEREMY, Look--
1771,VICKI," Go home, Jeremy. If i want to feel like crap about myself, I'll just go back to Tyler."
1772,STEFAN," Hey, have you seen Elena?"
1773,MATT," No, not for a while."
1774,STEFAN, You think she went home?
1775,MATT, Not sure.
1776,STEFAN, Thanks.
1777,MATT," Hey. I'm not saying this for you. I'm saying it for her. But she's big on trust. So whatever you're holding back from her, the more you try to hide it, the more she won't stop till she figures it out."
1778,VOICE," This is Michael Fell reporting to you from the salvatore boarding house, where a brutal animal attack has ended in tragedy. Ok, they're bringing out the bodies. See if you can get closer. Is that the nephew?"
1779,MRS FORBES, I didn't see you at the car wash.
1780,CAROLINE, Left early.
1781,MRS FORBES," Honey, are you ok? Anything you want to talk about? Is it a boy thing?"
1782,CAROLINE," Mom, if i want to talk boys, i'll call dad. At least he's successfully dating one."
1783,STEFAN," Zach! Oh, no, Zach..."
1784,ELENA," Dear diary, I'm not a believer. People are born, they grow old, and then they die. That's the world we live in. There's no magic, no mysticism, no immortality. There's nothing that defies rational thought. "
1785,BONNIE, I don't know what's happening to me. 
1786,GRAMS," I know, dear."
1787,JENNA, Logan? Logan?
1788,ELENA, People are supposed to be who they say they are. And not lie or hide their true selves.
1789,JEREMY, What are you doing here?
1790,LOGAN," Oh, hey, man. Just looking for the bathroom."
1791,ELENA," It's not possible. I'm not a believer, i can't be. But how can i deny what's right in front of me? Someone who never grows old... "
1792,OLD MAN," June, 1953."
1793,ELENA, Never gets hurt...
1794,ELENA," Oh, my god, your hand! Is it deep? How bad is it?"
1795,ELENA, Someone who changes in ways that can't be explained...
1796,ELENA," Hey, um, are you ok? Your eye. Your face."
1797,ELENA, Girls bitten...
1798,FLASHBACK, 
1799,ELENA," What is that? Oh, my god, what happened to you?"
1800,CAROLINE, It's nothing! 
1801,ELENA, Bodies drained of bl*od...
1802,ELENA, Did she say what kind of animal it was?
1803,MATT, She said it was a vampire.
1804,BOY, Donovan?
1805,VICKI," No, i'm good."
1806,GUYS," Not it. Not it. Not it. Ah, Vicki."
1807,VICKI," Hey, man, you ok? "
1808,DAMON, Come here. Come here. 
1809,VICKI, You don't look good.
1810,DAMON, Come closer. I have something-- That I have to tell you.
1811,VICKI," Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you, i got you. It's ok. it's ok."
1812,ELENA, What are you?
1813,STEFAN, You must be Miss Pierce.
1814,KATHERINE," Please, call me Katherine."
1815,ELENA, What are you? What are you?
1816,STEFAN, You know.
1817,ELENA," No, I don't."
1818,STEFAN," Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here."
1819,ELENA, It's not possible. It can't be.
1820,STEFAN, Everything you know... And every believe that you have is about to change. Are you ready for that?
1821,ELENA, What are you?
1822,STEFAN, I'm a vampire.
1823,ELENA, I shouldn't have come.
1824,STEFAN, No. Please.
1825,ELENA, No. No. How did you do that?
1826,STEFAN, Please don't be afraid of me.
1827,ELENA, Let me go.
1828,STEFAN," No. Elena, there's things that you have to know and understand."
1829,ELENA, Let me go!
1830,STEFAN," Elena, please. "
1831,STEFAN, Elena. I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
1832,ELENA," All those animal attacks, those people who died--"
1833,STEFAN, No. That was damon.
1834,ELENA, Damon?
1835,STEFAN," Yes. I don't drink human bl*od. That's not how I choose to survive, but Damon does. I'll explain everything to you, but I beg you, Elena, do not tell anybody."
1836,ELENA, How can you ask me that?
1837,STEFAN," Because you knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons. You can hate me, but I need you to trust me. "
1838,ELENA," Just go. Just go, please. Go. If you mean me no harm, then just go."
1839,STEFAN, I never wanted this.
1840,ELENA, Mmm.
1841,STEFAN, Hello.
1842,DAMON, I want my ring.
1843,STEFAN, Where are you?
1844,DAMON, I'm at the sizzler. I had the buffet. Where's my ring? 
1845,STEFAN, I don't have it. Where are you? What have you done?
1846,DAMON," No, what have you done? You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever i've sucked dry is on you, buddy."
1847,STEFAN," You're being careless. How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?"
1848,DAMON," I know how to cover my tracks, stefan. Where's my ring?"
1849,STEFAN, I gave it to Zach to hide. Probably shouldn't have k*ll him.
1850,DAMON," Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?"
1851,STEFAN," I'll get it back, but I need time."
1852,DAMON," What, did you fedex it to Rome? Where is it? I want my ring, Stefan, or my next stop's Elena's."
1853,STEFAN, I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
1854,DAMON, Don't give me another reason to rip you apart.
1855,STEFAN, Yeah? Is that gonna be before or after you get your ring back?
1856,DAMON, Just get it.
1857,ELENA," You just don't wanna die, do you? You said you would explain everything. That's why I asked you to meet me here. When you google ""vampire,"" you get a world of fiction. What's the reality?"
1858,STEFAN, I can tell you whatever you wanna know.
1859,ELENA, I know you eat garlic.
1860,STEFAN, Yes. 
1861,ELENA," And somehow, sunlight's not an issue."
1862,WOMEN, Here's your drinks.
1863,ELENA, Thank you.
1864,STEFAN, We have rings that protect us.
1865,ELENA, Crucifixes?
1866,STEFAN, Decorative.
1867,ELENA, Holy water?
1868,STEFAN, Drinkable.
1869,ELENA, Mirrors?
1870,STEFAN, Myth.
1871,ELENA, You said you don't k*ll to survive.
1872,STEFAN," Animal bl*od keeps me alive, but not as strong as Damon. It can be very powerful."
1873,ELENA, And yet you let him get involved with Caroline?
1874,STEFAN," Forcing Damon not to do something is much more dangerous, believe me."
1875,ELENA, He was hurting her.
1876,STEFAN," He was feeding on her. He was able to take away her memories of being bitten using a form of mind compulsion. She never knew what was happening to her. If he wanted to k*ll her, he would have."
1877,ELENA, Is that supposed to make it ok?
1878,STEFAN," No. no, none of this is ok, Elena. I know that."
1879,ELENA," Are there any others, aside from you and Damon?"
1880,STEFAN," Not in Mystic falls, not anymore."
1881,ELENA, Not anymore?
1882,STEFAN," There was a time when this town was... Very much aware of vampires, and it didn't end well for anybody. That's why it's important that you don'tell anyone."
1883,ELENA, I can't promise that.
1884,STEFAN," Elena... Give me today. I will answer any questions that you have, and when it's over, you can decide for yourself what you wanna do with what you know. It'll be your choice."
1885,LOGAN, Never smelled one this bad before.
1886,SHERIFF, It tried to cover its tracks.
1887,LOGAN, Are you sure?
1888,SHERIFF," I'm positive. You only burn a corpse to try to hide cause of death, and there are no shell casings."
1889,LOGAN, We know who they are?
1890,SHERIFF, Doc'll have to check their dental records.
1891,LOGAN, What story should i run?
1892,SHEIFF, Drug deal gone bad. It's not too big a stretch.
1893,LOGAN, I got the Gilbert watch.
1894,SGERIFF, Good.
1895,POLICEMAN, Found this in the brush about 10 yards away.
1896,SHERIFF, Vicki Donovan. 
1897,LOGAN, You know her?
1898,SHERIFF, I went to high school with her mother. 
1899,LOGAN, Think she's one of these?
1900,SHERIFF, I hope not.
1901,DAMON," Where are you, Stefan? I'm trapped at the house, and I'm getting really bored and really impatient, and I don't do bored and impatient. Bring me my ring. Damn it. Aw, don't get bl*od on the couch. Please."
1902,VICKI," I got you good, didn't i?"
1903,DAMON," Well, you're not gonna be any fun today. I'm so gonna regret this. Drink up. Drink it up. Don't drip. There you go. Good girl. That's it."
1904,STEFAN, Stop here.
1905,ELENA, What are we doing here?
1906,STEFAN, I want to show you something.
1907,ELENA, In the middle of nowhere?
1908,STEFAN, This... Didn't used to be nowhere. Used to be my home.
1909,ELENA, It looks so...
1910,STEFAN, Old? It's because they are.
1911,ELENA, Wait. How long have you...
1912,STEFAN, I've been 17 years old since 1864.
1913,ELENA," Oh, my god."
1914,STEFAN," You said you wanted to know. I'm not gonna hold anything back. Half century beforethe boardinghouse was even built, this was my family's home. Damon and I... We were both born here. The Salvatore brothers, best of friends."
1915,STEFAN, Wait. Where did you learn this game?
1916,DAMON, Camp outside Atlanta. One of the officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.
1917,STEFAN, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are the rules? What are the rules?
1918,KATHERINE, Who needs rules? Mind if I join you?
1919,STEFAN," Uh, well, you could, uh-- you could get hurt. My brother likes to play rough."
1920,KATHERINE," Somehow, I think that you play rougher."
1921,DAMON," Why are you just standing there? That is a girl who clearly wants to be chased. If you don't do it, I will."
1922,ELENA, You knew Katherine in 1864? Damon made it seem like...
1923,STEFAN," Damon was trying to make you think that... I was still heartbroken. He saw that I was happy with you, and he wanted to ruin it."
1924,ELENA, All because you loved the same girl 145 years ago?
1925,STEFAN, She wasn't just any girl.
1926,KATHERINE, Ha! I win. What's my prize?
1927,DAMON, What would you like it to be?
1928,STEFAN, They extended your leave?
1929,DAMON, I was simply having too much fun to return to battle.
1930,STEFAN, Your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring.
1931,KATHERINE," Well, this works out wonderfully for me. "
1932,DAMON," How's that, miss Katherine?"
1933,KATHERINE," Now i'll have both of you here to keep me entertained. First and foremost, I'll need someone to escort me to the founder's ball."
1934,DAMON/STEFAN, With pleasure. I would be honored.
1935,KATHERINE, The smart and kind Salvatore brothers both coming to my rescue. How will I ever choose?
1936,STEFAN, She chose me. I escorted her to the ball at the original Lockwood mansion.
1937,ELENA, The first founder's party... Where you signed the registry.
1938,STEFAN, I didn't care that I had gotten something that my brother wanted. I didn't even care if it hurt him. I only knew that I wanted her. 
1939,DAMON, So he was upset. 
1940,STEFAN, That's the thing about Damon. He doesn't get mad. He just gets even.
1941,VICKI," Oh, man. That shower was so great."
1942,VICKI, What did you give me?
1943,DAMON, Some bl*od. You loved it.
1944,VICKI, I did? Wait. I'm confused. How did we get here?
1945,DAMON," We was in the woods. You were drunk. I attacked you. Then i k*ll all of your friends and brought you here, gave you same bl*od. you loved it. And now we're gonna party till the sun goes down."
1946,VICKI," Ok. Um, but first, can i have another hit? That bl*od was so good."
1947,DAMON, Only if I can.
1948,STEFAN," What Damon wants, Damon usually gets. I didn't know it at the time, but... Turns out that night... Katherine was with him, too."
1949,ELENA," So he stole her from you, not the other way around?"
1950,STEFAN, Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.
1951,STEFAN, I will love you forever.
1952,KATHERINE," Forever is a very long time, you know."
1953,STEFAN, Not long enough.
1954,KATHERINE," Good morning. Clear the room, please. You're upset."
1955,STEFAN," Your face, it was like a demon."
1956,KATHERINE, But you're not afraid.
1957,STEFAN, Get away from me. Get away.
1958,KATHERINE, It doesn't change the way you feel about me. You will not tell anyone.
1959,STEFAN, I--
1960,KATHERINE, shh. We will go on exactly as we have.
1961,STEFAN, Yes. We will go on.
1962,KATHERINE," You have no idea of the future I have planned for us, Stefan-- You, me, and Damon. No rules."
1963,STEFAN," She could controlmy mind and Damon's. She compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other. She wanted all of us to be together forever. Didn't work out that way, but... Damon and i, looks like we're stuck with each other... Like it or not."
1964,ELENA, Is that Damon's ring?
1965,STEFAN," I took it from him, but i have to give it back."
1966,ELENA," No. don't, Stefan. keep it hidden."
1967,STEFAN," Elena, if i don't give it to him, he'll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me."
1968,ELENA, And how is that?
1969,STEFAN, By hurting you.
1970,SHERIFF, We're working on the burn bodies. 
1971,MR LOCKWOOD, Doc i.d. the bodies?
1972,SHERIFF, A few townies. Notorious druggies.
1973,MR LOCKWOOD, I suppose that'll make it easy for people to buy the story. And Vicki Donovan?
1974,SHERIFF, She's not one of the deceased.
1975,MR LOCKWOOD, Where the hell is she?
1976,SHERIFF, I wish I knew.
1977,LOGAN, Sorry i'm late.
1978,MR LOCKWOOD, You have the watch? It's ready.
1979,LOGAN, That's it?
1980,MR LOCKWOOD, Yes. That's it.
1981,VICKI," I am so over Tyler, so over him. I knew from the beginning that i was only a piece of ass to him, but i thought maybe if he got to know me better, he might see something more. But no. Now, Jeremy, on the other hand, that's all he's ever seen in me is something more, and i like that."
1982,DAMON," Jeremy, huh? Elena's brother?"
1983,VICKI," Yeah. yeah. So, Elena used to date my brother, and they were always together, so jeremy would always be hanging around and crushing on me and-- Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend? You're, like, totally cool and so hot."
1984,DAMON, I know.
1985,VICKI, Don't you wanna be in love?
1986,DAMON, I've been in love. It's painful and pointless and overrated. Except when it isn't. No more talking. Let's dance.
1987,VICKI," My mom spends most of her time in Virginia beach with Pete. He drives trucks. I don't remember my dad, bufrom what i gather, he's not worth remembering."
1988,DAMON, Your life is so pathetic.
1989,VICKI," Yeah. I mean, I'm the screwed-up one. Matt's got it so easy. he's the golden boy. I mean, he's gonna get a football scholarship and marry Elena and have a lawn mower and some babies, and when i think of my future, i just come up blank."
1990,DAMON, You are so damaged.
1991,VICKI, Yep.
1992,DAMON," I mean, you don't have one hint of self-esteem."
1993,VICKI," Nope, none."
1994,DAMON, I think I know what can help you.
1995,VICKI, So what's that?
1996,DAMON, Death.
1997,VICKI, What happened?
1998,DAMON," We were dancing, and then-- then I k*ll you."
1999,VICKI, What?
2000,DAMON, You're dead.
2001,VICKI, I'm dead?
2002,DAMON," Yeah, well, let's not make a big deal out of it. Drank my bl*od, i k*ll you, and now you have to feed in order to complete the process. You're wasted. You don't wanna be out there all alone. You're about to get really freaky."
2003,VICKI," Ok, I had a really good time. I just wanna go home."
2004,DAMON," You're gonna start craving bl*od, and until you get it, you're gonna feel very out of it. You have to be careful."
2005,VICKI," Come on, move."
2006,DAMON, See? you're already starting to fall apart.
2007,VICKI, And i'm going home now.
2008,DAMON," Ok, fine. I'm just warning you. Actually, you know what? You should go. In fact, if i were you, I would stop by your boyfriend Jeremy's house."
2009,VICKI," Yeah, whatever."
2010,DAMON," Bye. Tell Elena I said hi. and if you see Stefan, tell him to call me."
2011,SHERIFF, I got Stanley on the Moore street entrance. The rest of us'll cover other access points. Call him or call me if that thing goes off. Don't use the radio. Cellphones only.
2012,LOGAN, Got it.
2013,SHERIFF," You've got 8 rounds. Remember, wood b*ll*ts won't k*ll him, but it'll wound him enough for you to get close and stake him. You sure you can handle this?"
2014,LOGAN, Of course I can.
2015,SHERIFF, You ever staked a vampire before?
2016,LOGAN, Have you?
2017,JEREMY, Coming!
2018,VICKI, Hey. The sun is k*ll me. my eyes are on fire.
2019,JEREMY, Where have you been?
2020,VICKI, It's good. everything's good.
2021,JEREMY, Did something happen?
2022,VICKI, I'm hungry. What do you got to eat?
2023,JEREMY," You're high? Vicki, it's the middle of the day."
2024,VICKI," Could you just not talk so loud? My head, it hurts. I need quiet."
2025,ELENA, The mind control... You said Katherine used. Do you ever do that to me?
2026,STEFAN," No. That necklace, it contains an herb called vervain. It protects you from being compelled. I wanted to protect you from Damon's influence. But i also wanted to... Protect you from me. All right, n n you should never take that necklace off... Because no matter what happens after today, no matter how you feel about me... You'll know that you were free to make your own choice."
2027,MATT, Where is she?
2028,JEREMY, Come this way.
2029,MATT, What's she on?
2030,JEREMY, ---I don't know.
2031,MATT," Hey, Vic. How you doin'?"
2032,VICKI," Not good, Mattie. I hurt."
2033,MATT," Ok, where's it hurt?"
2034,VICKI," My gums. My jaw hurts. My gum--there's something in my gums, and it hurts."
2035,MATT," Ok, well--"
2036,VICKI, No. Just leave me alone.
2037,MATT," Come on, Vic. Don't be like that. Let's get you home."
2038,VICKI, Just turn it off!
2039,JEREMY, Turn what off?
2040,VICKI," The talking, the chatter, just turn it off."
2041,VOICE, ...horribly. 3 bodies were found dead in what is believed to be a drug deal gone awry. The bodies have yet to be identified. They were discovered earlier today over at the old Mystic Falls cemetery.
2042,JEREMY, That's where we were last night. 
2043,MATT," What happened, Vic?"
2044,VOICE," ..homicide, and are fast under way looking for suspects. They're asking anyone with information..."
2045,MATT, I'm calling the cops.
2046,VICKI, No. Don't.
2047,JEREMY," What happened after I left last night, Vick? "
2048,MATT," Dude, are you ok ?"
2049,JEREMY, I'm fine. i'm fine.
2050,MATT," Damn, Vick."
2051,ELENA, What's going on?
2052,MATT, She's really messed up.
2053,STEFAN," Elena, back up. Vicki, look at me. Focus. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the blinds. She's gonna be ok. Come on. Come on."
2054,ELENA, You know what's wrong with her?
2055,STEFAN, Yeah.
2056,ELENA, What is it?
2057,STEFAN, She's transitioning.
2058,ELENA, Transitioning to what?
2059,STEFAN, A vampire.
2060,ELENA, What?
2061,STEFAN, Damon must have gotten to her. She's new. She hasn't completed her transformation yet.
2062,ELENA, H-how does she do that?
2063,STEFAN, She has to feed on human bl*od.
2064,ELENA, And what if she doesn't?
2065,STEFAN, She'll die. She may only have a few hours.
2066,ELENA, She's upstairs with him right now.
2067,STEFAN, It's ok. She doesn't know what's happening to her yet.
2068,ELENA, So when is she gonna know?
2069,STEFAN," Right now, she doesn't remember anything. A part of her is still human, but slowly, the deeper she gets into the transition, the memories will start to come back, and then she'll know she has to make the choice."
2070,ELENA, The same choice you made?
2071,VICKI, I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
2072,JEREMY," Aw, you just--you need to sleep it off, ok?"
2073,VICKI, No.
2074,MATT, Vick. Vick!
2075,JEREMY," She was fine, and then she just-- she just freaked out."
2076,MATT, I'm gonna go look for her. Call me if you hear anything.
2077,STEFAN, I can track her.
2078,ELENA, Go.
2079,SHERIFF, Yeah.
2080,LOGAN, I think I got something. It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
2081,SHERIFF, Headed your way.
2082,JEREMY, Maybe we should check in with Matt.
2083,ELENA, He'll call when he finds her.
2084,JEREMY," Well, what are we supposed to do?"
2085,ELENA, We wait. We're supposed to wait.
2086,JEREMY, I don't know what's wrong with her. 
2087,ELENA, She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.
2088,ELENA," Jeremy, go upstairs."
2089,DAMON, You're afraid of me. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess. Stefan finally fessed up.
2090,ELENA, Stay away from me.
2091,DAMON," Hey, there's no need to be rude. I'm just looking for Stefan. May I come in? Oh, wait. Of course I can. I've been invited. We can cut to the chase if you want. I'm not gonna k*ll you right now. That wouldn't serve my greater agenda. So... Where's stefan?"
2092,ELENA, He's out looking for Vicki. 
2093,DAMON, Don't look at me with those judgey little eyes. Girl's gonna thank me for what I did to her.
2094,ELENA, Did you thank Katherine?
2095,DAMON," Mmm. Got the whole life story, huh?"
2096,ELENA, I got enough.
2097,DAMON," Oh, I doubt that. Tell my brother i'm looking for him. Oh, tip for later, be careful who you invite in the house."
2098,STEFAN, Vicki.
2099,VICKI," I'm starting to remember things, what he is, what he said. I remember you. The hospital, the--the rooftop, it's all coming back."
2100,STEFAN, I'm so sorry. Damon had no right to do this to you.
2101,VICKI, He said that I need to feed. What will happen if i don't?
2102,STEFAN, You'll fade quickly... And then it'll all just be over.
2103,VICKI, I'll be dead.
2104,STEFAN, Hey.
2105,VICKI, I don't want this.
2106,STEFAN, I know. It'll be ok. You're gonna be ok. I can help you.
2107,VICKI, Is it better? Is it better? Will I be better? I wanna go home. Will you take me home?
2108,STEFAN, Ok.
2109,STEFAN, Ahh! 
2110,VICKI, No!
2111,DAMON," It's wood. They know. If anyone's gonna k*ll you, it's gonna be me. My ring."
2112,STEFAN, No! No! Vicki!
2113,VICKI, I'm sorry.
2114,DAMON, Oops.
2115,SHERIFF, My god... The watch. Find the watch.
2116,ELENA, You're bleeding.
2117,STEFAN," No, it's ok. It's ok. I'm ok. "
2118,STEFAN, I couldn't stop her. I tried.
2119,ELENA, What does that mean?
2120,STEFAN," She fed, and then I lost her."
2121,ELENA," Oh, my god."
2122,STEFAN," I'll take care of it. I'll find her, and i will show her that she can live like I do. I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena. I promise you."
2123,ELENA, What do i tell my brother and-- and Matt?
2124,STEFAN, We'll come up with a story.
2125,ELENA, You mean we'll come up with a lie.
2126,STEFAN, I'm so sorry.
2127,ELENA," I gave you today just like you asked. And I understand that you would never do anything to hurt me, and I promise I will keep your secret, but... I can't be with you, Stefan. I'm sorry. I- I just can't..."
2128,Tyler,See you bro!
2129,Vicky,Hi Ty!
2130,Tyler,Whoa Vicky?Everyone's looking for you.
2131,Vicky,I know.
2132,Tyler,What's wrong Vic?
2133,Vicky,I'm so cold.
2134,Tyler,Are you on drugs. Everyone thinks you're off on a bender.
2135,Vicky,I wish.
2136,Tyler,"What happened in those wood ,Vicky? Those kids that were k*ll,What did you see?"
2137,Vicky,I'm so scared.
2138,Tyler,Come here. It's okay. I'll take you home.
2139,Vicky,I can't control it.
2140,Tyler,Control what?
2141,Vicky,"I am so hungry ,Ty. And it won't go away."
2142,Tyler,What are you on ? What drugs did you take?
2143,Vicky,"I want it. I am so hungry,Ty."
2144,Tyler,"Okay,look, I'll get you something to eat. Just sit back. Look,let just get you home, Vicky. Okay, what is wrong with you?"
2145,Vicky, Aah! Let go of me!
2146,Tyler,"What's going on here,Stefan? What's wrong with her?"
2147,Damon, You don't talk.
2148,Tyler," Screw you, dude."
2149,Damon," ""Dude"" really?, ""dude""."
2150,Stefan ," Damon,don't."
2151,Damon,Oh come on. Who's gonna miss this idiot?
2152,Vicky,Ooh ! Don't you hurt him.
2153,Damon,Forget what you saw here tonight. None of us were here.
2154,Elena, Sorry.
2155,Jeremy,"Oh, no , it's cool, I'm done."
2156,Elena,You're up early. Where are you going?
2157,Jeremy,"Police station. They're organizing the search party for Vicky , so..."
2158,Elena,Wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
2159,Jeremy," What? You're kidding me, right ?"
2160,Elena,"You shouldn't skip school. If they find her, we'll know. That's what cellphones are for."
2161,Jeremy,"Yeah, you're lips keep movin'. I don't know why."
2162,Matt,Yeah?
2163,Vicky,Matty?
2164,Matt,"Vicky, where are you? Are you okay?"
2165,Vicky,Yeah. I'm okay.
2166,Matt,"Tell me where you are , and I'll come to get you."
2167,Vicky," No. Matty , I just need some time to figure things out. Just know that I am okay , okay ? Please don't worry about me."
2168,Vicky,I don't understand why I have to stay cooped up here. Why can't I just go home?
2169,Stefan," Because you're changing ,Vicky, and it's not something you wanna do alone."
2170,Damon,There's nothin' about that Logan guy I k*ll in here. Not a word. Someone's covering it up.
2171,Vicky,What is that?
2172,Damon,"This is a very special, very old compass. What was Logan Fell with it? Aren't you curious?"
2173,Stefan,"Well , if you're so worried that somebody's onto you, why don't you just leave town, Damon?"
2174,Damon,We should be all worried.
2175,Vicky,"Hey, um, I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?"
2176,Stefan, Here.
2177,Vicky,What is it?
2178,Stefan,It's what you're craving.
2179,Damon,"Heh. Don't lie to the girl. It's so not what you're craving,but it'll do in a pinch, right , Stef?"
2180,Vicky,What is it?
2181,Damon,"Yeah, what is it? Is it a skunk? Saint Bernard? Bambi?"
2182,Stefan,Go on. Give it a try.
2183,Damon,She's new. She needs people bl*od. She can't sustain on that stuff. 
2184,Vicky,"Yeah, why can't I have people bl*od?"
2185,Damon,Yeah.
2186,Stefan,"Because it's wrong to pray on innocent people, Vicky."
2187,Damon,You don't have to k*ll to feed. Just find someone really tasty and then erase their memory after wards. It's so easy.
2188,Stefan,"No,no ,no. There's no guarantee that you can control yourself, okay? It takes years to learn that. You could easily k*ll somebody, and then you have to carry that with you for the rest of your life, which, if I haven't made clear,is eternity."
2189,Damon,"Don't listen to him. He walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line. I say snatch, eat, erase."
2190,Stefan,"Hey, look at me. We choose our own path. Our values and our actions , they define who we are."
2191,Damon,"Okay, count deepak. I am outta here."
2192,Vicky, Can I have some more?
2193,Elena, Is Stefan here?
2194,Damon, Yep!
2195,Elena,Where is he?
2196,Damon,"And good morning to you, little miss "" I'm on a mission""."
2197,Elena,How can you be so arrogant and glib after everything that you've done?
2198,Damon,And how can you be so brave and stupid to call a vampire glib and arrogant?
2199,Elena,"If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead."
2200,Damon,"Yes, you would."
2201,Elena,But I'm not.
2202,Damon,Yet.
2203,Elena,Where is Stefan?
2204,Damon,"He's upstairs singing ""the rain in Spain"". Knock yourself out."
2205,Elena,Stefan? Stefan?
2206,Stefan,Yes.
2207,Elena,Where is Vicky?
2208,Stefan,She's upstairs.
2209,Elena,What happens now? Because my brother is out there searching for her with the rest of the town. What do I tell him?
2210,Stefan,"I'm working with her, but it's gonna take time. She's a very volatile and impulsive personality. She's a drug user. I mean, all that's gonna play a part in how she respond to this."
2211,Elena,"So, she's a vampire with issues? What am I supposed to do? Because I'm lying to everyone that I care about. What's gonna happen to her?"
2212,Stefan,I'm gonna keep her here with me until I know that she's safe.
2213,Vicky,How long is that?
2214,Stefan,We can talk about that later.
2215,Elena,"Hey, Vicky, How are you?"
2216,Vicky,"How am I? You're kidding ,right?"
2217,Bonnie,Was our family b*rned in the witch trials?
2218,Grams,"No,the girls that were persecuted in Salem were entirely innocent. You have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch."
2219,Bonnie,How did we end up in Mystic Falls?
2220,Grams,Our family fled Salem in 1692 and relocated here. Our ancestors lived in secrecy for over a hundred years. It's important that we still do.
2221,Bonnie,"Well Grams, everybody knows you're a witch."
2222,Grams,"They also know it's absurd, can't be true. I'm just a kooky lady that teaches occult at the university. No ones really believes. They just poke fun. And let 'em . Just don't let 'em know the truth."
2223,Bonnie,"Where's the witchcraft? I mean, you've been talking history for 2 days. I wanna get to the fun part."
2224,Grams,"It's not meant to be fun. It's real and it's serious, and you must understand it before you practice it. Aren't you late for school?"
2225,Man,We should have never trusted that Logan...Weasel with the watch.
2226,Woman,How many are we dealing with?
2227,Man,"Well , the coroner thinks one. Something about the wound radius and the jaw pattern ."
2228,Woman,"Are we in danger? I mean, if it found the watch, then it knows we know, and could it come after us? A-and should I even be saying ""it""? Or..or is it a he or a she?"
2229,Man,"If it has any historical knowledge of the town, then it'll know where the watch came from, so yes, we could very much be in danger."
2230,Woman,So what do we do?
2231,Man,Just keep it quiet. We can't have the entire town aware of this. We need to find him before he finds us.
2232,Tyler,Hey man!
2233,Matt,Hey!
2234,Tyler,I heard they're putting together a search party for Vicky.
2235,Matt,She just called. She's okay.
2236,Tyler,Ooh good. That's great. I figured you must have been goin' out of your mind.
2237,Matt,Little bit . Yeah.
2238,Tyler,"I was just gonna offer. You know, if there's anything I could do."
2239,Matt,I appreciate it.
2240,Caroline,I have got your costume. It's all here.
2241,Bonnie,Seriously?
2242,Caroline,"Come on. Can someone please be excited that it's Halloween? I just wanna have fun, you know , just some silly, fluffy, Damon free fun."
2243,Bonnie,"Hey, isn't this the one you got from Damon?"
2244,Caroline,"Yep. Wear it . Toss it. I don't care. I just want it gone. Hey, have you seen Elena? Do we know what she's wearing?"
2245,Bonnie,I was with Grams all week-end . I haven't talked to her. Maybe she's with Stefan.
2246,Caroline,Riding to his castle on his white horse.
2247,Bonnie, Don't be bitter . It provoke wrinkles.
2248,Stefan,"Coffee is our friend. It's the caffeine. It circulate through our veins, and it warms our body so we're not cold to the touch."
2249,Vicky," Well, what if I wanna drink human bl*od?"
2250,Stefan,You're gonna have to learn to live with that urge and fight it on a daily basis one day at time.
2251,Vicky," Oh god! Don't start with that whole 12 steps thing. School counselor has been down that road, and it doesn't work for me."
2252,Stefan,"It can work. It's your choice ,Vicky."
2253,Vicky,So you've never tasted human bl*od?
2254,Stefan,Not in a long time.
2255,Vicky,How long?
2256,Stefan,Years and years. I'm not proud of my past behavior.
2257,Vicky,Does this sketchy feelings ever go away? It's like I have a massive hangover. This daylight thing is a bitch. I need more bl*od. Where's your bathroom ? I have to pee. Why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.
2258,Stefan,"I'm going to , uh...I'm gonna get her some more. All right. I'll be quick."
2259,Vicky,"False alarm. My body's feeling really funky. It's a good funk , but it's weird."
2260,Elena,"Hmm, who are you calling?"
2261,Vicky,Jeremy.
2262,Elena,"Vicky, you can't see Jeremy anymore."
2263,Vicky,Oh come on don't you start. I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
2264,Elena,Even though you could hurt him?
2265,Vicky,I would never Hurt Jeremy.
2266,Elena,I know you think that but I can't take the risk. You're gonna have to let Jeremy go now.
2267,Vicky," Oh oh Really? An how long have you been preparing a ""you're not good enough "" speech? I'm presuming it predates the whole vampire thing."
2268,Elena,"All I am saying is Jeremy is not getting involved in any of this. I mean it, Vicky."
2269,Vicky,"Or what? Let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch. You had my brother whipped for 15 years. 15 years and then you dumped him. When I look at you that is all I see, just so you know. And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy, because I have some fun new toys to play with , and I won't think twice about ripping your little head off. You got it ?"
2270,Elena, She threatened me.
2271,Stefan,"She's on edge. Imagine every sense in your body operating at super speed. I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin. And then when you throw in her other issues..."
2272,Elena, How long before it settles?Hours?Days?Weeks?
2273,Stefan,There's no rule book.
2274,Elena,"Well, how long before you learned to control it?"
2275,Stefan,"A while, But I didn't have anybody helping me. I had to do it on my own. The thing is it's hard to resist certain people especially when you're new, it's difficult to separate your feelings. Love,lust,anger,desire...it can all blur into one urge, hunger."
2276,Elena,What does that mean?
2277,Stefan,"It means that Jeremy can't see her, not now. She might not be able to resist him, and she could hurt him."
2278,Elena, Or worse.
2279,Stefan, I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
2280,Elena,I need to get going.
2281,Stefan,Elena...
2282,Elena,Please Stefan. There's only so much I can take.
2283,Damon,What are you doing?
2284,Vicky,Just contemplating the next hundred years. Why did you do it?
2285,Damon,I was …. bored.
2286,Vicky,You did this to me out of boredom?
2287,Damon,It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
2288,Vicky,Now I'm bored. And all I can think about is bl*od. I just want some bl*od. I can't think about anything else. What is that about?
2289,Damon,That' ll ease up. You've been cooped up all day. Let's go.
2290,Vicky,Where?
2291,Damon,Your life was pathetic. Your afterlife doesn't have to be.
2292,Stefan,What are you doing?
2293,Damon,She's been cooped up in your room all day. She's not Anne Frank.
2294,Stefan,No no no . Hey hey...Now's not the time for this.
2295,Damon,If you're gonna teach her. Teach her. Show her what it's all about.
2296,Stefan,She could hurt someone.
2297,Damon,I'm not takin' her at Disneyland. We're going in the front yard. Come on.
2298,Stefan,Bad idea Damon.
2299,Damon,"She's a vampire Stefan, she should know the perks."
2300,Vicky,Like what?
2301,Damon,Like...
2302,Vicky,Whoa. How did you do that? Ho ho ho ho.
2303,Damon," Come on Vicky ,live a little. No pun intended."
2304,Stefan,uh...
2305,Damon,My bad.
2306,Vicky,Matt.
2307,Matt,Vicky? Is that you?
2308,Vicky,Hey.
2309,Matt,Get in here.
2310,Vicky,In a minute. I...
2311,Matt,"Please come inside. I've been worried. Thank god you're okay. Where were you , vic?"
2312,Vicky,It's not a big deal. Drop it already.
2313,Matt, 3 people were m*rder in the woods. The cops were lookin' for you. They wanna question you.
2314,Vicky,They know where I live.
2315,Matt,Everyone was worried about you.
2316,Vicky, I'm back now . Just let it go.
2317,Matt,"Are you kidding? I had a freakin' search party out lookin' for you while you were off on your crazy drug trip, and you want me to let it go?"
2318,Vicky,My head hurts.
2319,Matt,You think?
2320,Matt,"Stefan, what are you doing here?"
2321,Stefan,Is Vicky home?
2322,Matt,Yeah.
2323,Stefan,"Can I see her ,please?"
2324,Vicky,Don't let him in. I don't want him in here.
2325,Matt,Did he do something to you?
2326,Vicky,No. I just don't want him in here.
2327,Stefan,Just let me come in so I can explain myself.
2328,Matt,"Look, I don't know what's going on but I think you should leave now."
2329,Stefan,Matt...
2330,Matt,"Please,now,Stefan."
2331,Jeremy,"You gotta call me ,vic. I don't get it. What's going on with you? Just...just call me please."
2332,Elena,"Hey. So,um, do you wanna hang out tonight? We could go to the ,uh, Halloween thing at school. Could be fun"
2333,Jeremy, Cool. Sure. Sounds uh... sounds fun. Can't wait.
2334,Elena,I know you're upset about Vicky. I heard she call Matt. But you can't be with her. She needs to get better. The best thing you can do for her is let her go.
2335,Jeremy,"What does that even mean, ""let her go""? Oh ,okay, sure. Since we're such experts on letting people go , right?"
2336,Elena,"I know you may not see it, but trust me Jer. It's for the best."
2337,Jeremy,"Look, for month after mom and dad died, I felt like crap, like ""nothing really even mattered"" crap. Now all of a sudden,I get these moments and things started to feel just a little bit better, and Vicky was in every single of 'em. So you may not see it, but trust me.Keeping me away from her is not for the best."
2338,Tyler, Cider for the ladies. It's a Lockwood special.
2339,Bonnie,No way. Last year I was hung over until thanksgiving.
2340,Caroline, Lightweight. I am going to drink until someone is hot enough to make out with.
2341,Tyler,Sounds like a plan.
2342,Man,How many martinis have you had.
2343,Woman,Oh. Don't start with me.
2344,Man,Can we go now? We're late for the Halloween party. Let's go.
2345,Woman,So go ahead. I'd like to finish my drink.
2346,Damon,"Let me guess. Daisy Buchanan. I love a good ""gatsby"" look."
2347,Woman,I've met you before. Aren't you Caroline Forbes' boyfriend?
2348,Damon,"Ah, she had a schoolgirl crush on me but...It was cute but I had to let her down easy."
2349,Woman,"It's Damon,right?"
2350,Damon,"Ah, you remember?"
2351,Woman,"Well, you have a face that's hard to forget. What's your last name Damon?"
2352,Damon,Salvatore.
2353,Woman,Salvatore.
2354,Damon,Mm hmm.
2355,Woman,Are you any relation to Zach?
2356,Damon, Zach's my uncle. How do you know zach?
2357,Woman,are you okay?
2358,Damon,Yeah. I think there's something in my eye.
2359,Woman,"Well, I know Zach from the founders council. You know the Salvatores were one of this town's original settlers."
2360,Damon,"Yes , they were. I wasn't aware that Zach was a member. I just recently moved back home and haven't really had a chance to meet many of his friends."
2361,Woman," Well , will you tell him to return my calls?I've left several messages."
2362,Damon, Zach went out of town for a bit. But if it's about the Vervain...
2363,Woman, You know about the Vervain?
2364,Damon,"Well, I'm a Salvatore. Of course I do."
2365,Woman,Of course.
2366,Damon,Hmm. Cheers.
2367,Kids,Aah aah!
2368,Matt,"You went with the last year's costume too,huh?"
2369,Elena,Yeah. I didn't know that I was coming till an hour.
2370,Matt,Me neither. And you're going as...you.
2371,Elena,He's not talking to me right now. We got onto fight.
2372,Matt,"Yeah, I got into it with Vic too, when she got home. I'm trying not to smother her tonight, but part of meididt wanna let her out of my sight."
2373,Elena,She's here?
2374,Matt,"Yeah, you can't miss her. She's a vampire."
2375,Elena,Where did Jeremy go?
2376,Matt,Elena what's the matter?
2377,Elena,I..I've gotta find him.
2378,Vicky,"What, you're following me now?"
2379,Stefan,You didn't really give me a much of choice.
2380,Vicky,You let me out of here.
2381,Stefan,"You shouldn't be here Vicky. Crowds like this, it make it even harder for you to keep yourself under control."
2382,Vicky,I'm fine.
2383,Stefan,Really?
2384,Vicky,Mm Hmm.
2385,Stefan,No headache? Your stomach's not screaming at you? You're not feeling lightheaded or anxious or cranky like if someone looks at you the wrong way you could just rip their head off? Do you wanna know what that's called? T's called hunger and it's only gonna get worse and worse every minute that you pretend like it's not controlling you.
2386,Damon,So you need vervain?
2387,Woman,"Yes. my husband and I only have left What his parents left him,And zach had promised that he could supply us with more."
2388,Damon,"Well, I talk to him all the time,So why don't I just ask him?"
2389,Woman,Hmm.
2390,Damon," Mmm . How much do you need?I mean, how many people,you think?"
2391,Woman,"Well, there's our children,of course."
2392,Damon,Of course.
2393,Woman,"And, um, friends, family,And everyone on the council."
2394,Damon,The council?
2395,Woman,Zach knows how many. But I am so late. My husband is not going to be happy with me.
2396,Damon,"Well, are you happy with your husband?"
2397,Woman,You're flirting with me.
2398,Damon,You flirted with me first.
2399,Woman,True.
2400,Damon,"Let me escort you to the school. It's not safe out there alone. I mean, I've seen 10 vampires tonight."
2401,Woman,"Heh. well, if only the real ones were as easy to find."
2402,Damon,How's that search goin'?
2403,Woman,"Oh, we had the founder's party,And anyone who arrived during the day Was eliminated as a suspect."
2404,Damon,Oh.
2405,Woman,"And all the rest were just dead ends, so mmm mmm, I gotta go."
2406,Damon,Okay.
2407,Elena,Thank God.
2408,Stefan,What's the matter?
2409,Elena,I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
2410,Matt,What's goin' on?
2411,Stefan,"Hey. uh, everything's fine."
2412,Vicky,I told you to quit bothering me.
2413,Elena,"No. Vicky, don't do this."
2414,Vicky,"Matt, he won't leave me alone."
2415,Matt,"You need to back off, man."
2416,Elena,"Matt, it's...it's okay."
2417,Matt,"No, it's not okay. What the hell is your problem?"
2418,Elena,Stefan. She's gone.
2419,Stefan,I'm trying to help her.
2420,Jeremy,"Whoa. Vic, you scared the hell out of me."
2421,Vicky,Sorry. I'm sorry.
2422,Damon,So where...where'd Caroline run off to?
2423,Bonnie,"Do yourself a favor, Damon,and don't ask me about Caroline."
2424,Damon,"Oh, bonnie. So loyal."
2425,Bonnie,Just stay away from her.
2426,Damon,Where'd you get that?
2427,Bonnie,From a friend.
2428,Damon,"Caroline. You know that's mine,don't you?"
2429,Bonnie,Not anymore.
2430,Damon,"Funny. I'd like it back, please."
2431,Bonnie,"I'm not giving it to you. I'll give it to Caroline,and she can give it to you If she feels like it."
2432,Damon,Or I could just take it right now.
2433,Elena,Jeremy.
2434,Jeremy,I was so worried about you.
2435,Vicky,"I'm fine now, but...I gotta leave."
2436,Jeremy,Wh...what?Where? 
2437,Vicky,"I gotta get out of here, j. I just...I can't live at home with Matt.He just doesn't get it."
2438,Jeremy,"No, you can't. You can't just leave."
2439,Vicky,"Come with me. If you come with me, we can be together forever."
2440,Jeremy,"Okay. Yeah. Ow. You're taking that costume a little too far. What? what is it?. Vicky! Vicky, what the hell?! Oh, my god. No! stop! Vicky!No! Aah!"
2441,Elena,"Vicky, no!"
2442,Jeremy, Vicky!
2443,Stefan,Go. get inside. Go!
2444,Elena,Aah.
2445,Jeremy,Vicky. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky.
2446,Elena,Get him out of here.
2447,Damon,What?
2448,Stefan,Need your help.
2449,Grams,What happened to you?
2450,Bonnie,I did something. I don't know. It came from my necklace.
2451,Grams,Where'd you get that?
2452,Bonnie,It's part of my costume. It's a piece of junk.
2453,Grams,"That piece of junk belonged to one Of the most powerful witches of our family. Let me show you. There she is. Emily Bennett,Your great-great-great-great-grandmother. And there's your necklace."
2454,Damon,You should go. I got this.
2455,Elena,You did this. This is your fault.
2456,Damon,"You confuse me for someone with remorse. None of this matters to me,None of it."
2457,Elena,"People die around you. How could it not matter? It matters, and you know it."
2458,Damon,"You need to leave. Your wounds are bleeding,and you need to leave."
2459,Matt,"Elena!Hey, have you seen...Whoa. wh...what happened?"
2460,Elena,Nothing. some idiot with some fake bl*od got me. I'm gonna go home and shower.
2461,Matt,I...I can't find Vicky. She totally bailed on me.
2462,Elena,I don't know where she is.
2463,Matt,"Is this what I'm in for,A lifetime of worrying about her?"
2464,Elena,"You're a good brother, Matt."
2465,Matt,"Yeah, Maybe she went home."
2466,Elena,Maybe.
2467,Elena,Where is he?
2468,Stefan,Inside.
2469,Elena,Do you understand what happened tonight?
2470,Jeremy,"No. I don't understand. I mean, I know what I saw, but...I don't understand."
2471,Elena, She was going to k*ll me..
2472,Jeremy,Now she's dead. Vicky's dead.
2473,Elena,"I'm so sorry, jer."
2474,Jeremy,Make it stop. It hurts.
2475,Elena,"Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. it's okay."
2476,Jeremy,Why does everybody have to die on me?
2477,Elena,"Oh, my god. come here."
2478,Elena,Are you okay?
2479,Stefan,"I, uh...I wanted to help her. But instead, uh...How's he doin'?"
2480,Elena,He's a mess. I don't want him going through this again. He's just a kid.
2481,Stefan,"Elena, what can I do? I...What can I do to help? I'll do anything."
2482,Elena,Can you make him forget?
2483,Stefan,Elena...
2484,Elena,"Stefan, please. I don't know how he'll ever get past this. I just want him to forget everything that happened."
2485,Stefan,"If I did it, there's no guarantee that it would work...Because of who I am, Because of how I live. I don't have the ability to do it right."
2486,Damon, I can do it. If this is what you want...I'll do it.
2487,Elena,It's what I want.
2488,Damon,What do you want him to know?
2489,Elena,"I want you to tell him that Vicky left town And she's not coming back,That he shouldn't look for her or worry about her. He's gonna miss her, but he knows it's for the best."
2490,Elena,"Part of me wishes that I could forget, too...Forget meeting you,Finding out what you are and everything that's happened since."
2491,Stefan,If that's what you want.
2492,Elena,"Yes, it is. Because I don't want it to be like this. I don't wanna feel like this. But I can't. With everything that's happened...I can't lose the way I feel about you."
2493,Damon,It's done.
2494,Stefan,Damon?
2495,Stefan, Lexi!
2496,Lexi,Hi.

2504,Stefan,Do you think he would actually remember us? That was a pretty crazy week-end huh?
2505,Lexi,"We can make him remember us.Come on Let's go.I mean,What's keeping you here."
2506,Stefan,I told you her name is Elena.
2507,Lexi,Let's hope she's better than the last girl you got all sprung over.
2508,Stefan,Tou didn't even know Katherine.
2509,Lexi,Cause if I did I'd kick her ass .Little bitch. Speaking of... where's Damon?
2510,Stefan,Inflicting misery somewhere. you gonna be ok here alone? Cause I got some things I gotta take care of.
2511,Lexi,It's not exactly like I can go anywhere. And you and damon are the only ones whit these nifty little daylight rings. I'have a mood ring form seventy five trade ya.

2518,Sheriff Forbes,Where did Vicky says she was going?
2519,Jeremy,She didn't.
2520,Sheriff Forbes, Did she tell her brother where she's going ?
2521,Matt , No she didn't say anything to me . She told Jeremy to tell me that she was leaving town.
2522,Sheriff Forbes,Is there anyone I can talk to that may know what happened to her prior to her living town ?
2523,Matt, Stefan Salvatore may know he came by the house to see her but she wouldn't talk to him.
2524,Sheriff Forbes,What was he doing here?
2525,Stefan," I was trying to help, i knew that elena was worried about her brother, he was dating vicky and she had drug problem so i tried to help."
2526,Sheriff Forbes,So you got involved because Elena asked you to?
2527,Elena,I asked stefan to help i thought that by helping vicky he was helping my brother.
2528,Sherif Forbes ,What was her behavior like those last few days before she left ?
2529,Matt,"Up and down , very sketchy like she was coming down from some major party."
2530,Sheriff Forbes,Any signs of agression or violence?
2531,Jeremy,No that I remember.
2532,Stefan,No.
2533,Elena,No.
2534,Sheriff Forbes,So you believe that Vicky has really left town?
2535,Matt,Yes.
2536,Stefan,Yes.
2537,Elena,Yes.
2538,Jeremy,I'll miss her but ...I thing it's for the best.
2539,Stefan,I was tryin' to help her matt. That's all.
2540,Elena, I'll meet you guys at the car.
2541,Jenna,Ok
2542,Stefan,You're okay ?
2543,Elena, I don't think the sheriff suspected anything . Jeremy had no memory at all . All he knew wa what Damon made him know.
2544,Stefan,Thank you.
2545,Elena,"I can't do this stefan.Everytime I look at Matt or Jeremy ,all I tkink that vicky is never gonna come back. And they'llnever know why.Around you people get hurt and people die. I can't i just... it's just to much..."

2557,Damon,why are you so mean to me.
2558,Lexi,"have you met you? , you're not nice person."

2566,Bonnie's Grand Mother, You're leavin' ?
2567,Bonnie,Dad doesn't like it when I stay here too much.
2568,Bonnie's Grand Mother,Because he misses you or because he doesn't trust me. You're father's problemis he lacks imagination. He thinks I fill your head with my whitchy juju .
2569,Bonnie,He's right.
2570,Bonnie's Grand Mother, He's always rights that's his other problem.You needto be wearing that.
2571,Bonnie, Igotta give it back to caroline it doesn't belong to me.
2572,Bonnie's Grand Mother, Yes it does it was your ancestor's and now it yours .

2577,Elena , So are you.
2578,Jenna, My wallow is legitimate. I was dumped.
2579,Elena,Yeah. Well logan 's a jerk.
2580,Jenna," You didn't get a brush-off e-mail say:"" I'm leaving town see ya."""
2581,Jeremy, Wanna keep it down over there.
2582,Jenna, Why? What are you doing?
2583,Jeremy, Homework.
2584,Elena,Since when do you do homework?
2585,Jeremy, I gotta finish this.i'm way behing and I have a quizz tomorrow so...
2586,Elena, What do you think ?Alien?
2587,Jenna,Some sort of replicant.
2588,Jeremy, he can hear you
2589,Sheriff Forbes,Yeah so send him in .[Damon enter to the office] Mister Salvatore come on in .Could you get the door for me?
2590,Damon,Sure.
2591,Sheriff Forbes,I understand from Mrs. Lockwood that your uncle's is out the town.
2592,Damon, Yes he is . but I spoke to Zach . He filled me in and asked me if I could bring this to you.
2593,Sheriff Forbes,Vervain.
2594,Damon, That's all we have at the moment I hope it's enough.
2595,Sheriff Forbes,"It's a small circle ...Founding families , a few city officials."
2596,Damon,"And your deputies, of course right? Are we any closer?"
2597,Sheriff Forbes ,I think our facts are wrong . We've always believed that vampires can only come out in the dark. What if that's changed.
2598,Damon,So is that even possible
2599,Sheriff Forbes, We've exhausted every other option . We have to consider the vampire may be walking around during the day.Right in front of us.
2600,Damon,Hum .So what's the next step?
2601,Sheriff Forbes," We are looking at anyone new to town ,since the deaths began. Should turn up a suspect or two."
2602,Damon,And I of course will do anything I can to help.
2603,Bonnie, You Up ?
2604,Elena," No Bonnie tire la couverture, no, no."
2605,Bonnie, Why haven't you call me back?

2685,Lexi,"I've just met Eelena, you have some serious explaining to do.You have some serious emotion damage."
2686,Stefan,"No it's not what you think, she's not Katherine."
2687,Lexi,So they're related cause they can be twins.
2688,Stefan,I don't know.
2689,Lexi,You don't know or you didn't find out?
2690,Stefan,"No maybe i don't want to know. I have no desire to tie Elena to Katherine.Ok yes , yes the resemblance is what drew me in .But that's it.Katherine and Elena may look the same at the outside but at the inside they are completely different."
2691,Lexi,So Eelena is not a raging Bitch then huh?
2692,Stefan,"No. Elena is ... Elena's warm and she's...she's kind, and carind ans she's selfless and it's real and honestly when I'm around her... I completely forget what I am."

2745,Lexi,"Okay,I'm gonna need a litle more foot movement."
2746,Stefan, Yeah not really interested in making a fool out of myself.
2747,Lexi, Come on you're not that bad.

2762,Damon, I'm gonna need a less vague question.
2763,Elena," When you did what you did to jeremy's memory of vicky, what else did you do to him?"
2764,Damon, You asked me to take away his memory of fangs and all the bad stuff .You wanted me to take away his suffering.
2765,Elena," But he's acting different he seems okay with everything and a little too okay.I mean he's studing , he's not doing drugs ,he's not drinkig, are you sure you didn't do something else?"
2766,Damon,elena I took away the suffering.
2767,Bonnie, Caroline.

2770,Caroline,"What is there to explain Bonnie ?you got what you wanted... and something that doesn't even belong to you by the way and I get called a shallow , useless waste of space."
2771,Bonnie, Who said that to you?

2890,Elena,"Why are ou so pissed at her ,anyway?"
2891,Caroline," She's a thief. That's why. I gave her my necklace ,and she refuses to give it back. It's matter of principle."
2892,Elena," All right.Well ,I tried. I'm officially out of it."
2893,Caroline, Good .Where's Stefan?
2894,Elena, He's avoiding me.
2895,Caroline, Why?

2898,Matt,Hey
2899,Caroline,Hey
2900,Elena,Are you alright? [Bonnie Just nod]
2901,Teacher,"Good Morning everyone.Alrighty. In , Alaric Saltzman. It's mouthfull.Iknow.Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.Saltzman is of German origins .My family emigrated here in 1755 to Texas. I,however,was born and raised in Boston . Now the name Alaric belongs to a very dead great-grand-father I will never be able to thank enough. You'll probably want to pronouce""Alaric"" but it's ...""Alaric"",okay. So you can call me Rick.I'm your new history teacher."
2902,Damon, Rise and Shine. You'll be late for school.
2903,Stefan , What...What are you doing?
2904,Damon,Peace offering. Come on you need it for bl*od circulation. Does dead flesh good?All right. I'mSorry.
2905,Stefan," Step aside,please."
2906,Damon,"I got the town off our back. It was for the greater good but I'm sorry.And to prove it ,I'm not gonna feed on human"
2907,Stefan,"Cause I realize that k*ll your clothest and oldest friend is beyond evil ,and yet somehow, it's worthy of humor."
2908,Damon,Are you mimicking me?
2909,Stefan,"Yes stefan .Now that the secret society of vampires haters is off our back , I can go back to my routine of how can I destroy Stefan's life this week."
2910,Damon,And I can go back to sulking and Elena-longing and forehead brooding. This is fun . I like this.
2911,Stefan, And I will finaly reveall the ulterior motive behing my evil and diabolical return to Mystic falls.
2912,Damon,"Yeah .I'm done . That's just like you, Damon .Always have to have the last word."
2913,Bonnie,And then I ended up at the remain of the old fell's church before I woke up back in the woods.
2914,Elena,And your always see your ancestor Emily.
2915,Bonnie,"Hein, hein .Do you believe in gosths?"
2916,Elena,Two weeks ago I'd said no but now...
2917,Bonnie,Cause i think I'm being hunted.
2918,Elena,I don't get it. Why Emily?
2919,Bonnie,"Granms said she was a powerful witch back in the civil w*r days and this medallion was hers ,a witch's talisman."
2920,Elena,And all started when you got the necklace?
2921,Bonnie, I think she's using it to communicate with me.
2922,Elena, Ok what does Grams say about it?
2923,Bonnie," I can't call her . She's gonna tell me to embrace it .I don't want to embrace it., I want it to stop."
2924,Jeremy,"Hey Mister Saltzman , I'm Jeremy Gilbert .You wanted to see me?"
2925,Alaric,You know that your old teacher had a jackass file ?No joke.It's...typed on a label. It has all the ...troublesmakers in it but really it's just an opus... to you.Don't worry about it. I'm not him .Clean slate.Now... let's talk about grades.
2926,Jeremy,"I know it's been a rough couple of month ,but I've been trying to turn them around."
2927,Alaric,"I saw that but the problem is we're halfway through a semester and... after half a fail iis still pretty bleak,this is the part where you say to me : ""But what can I do to change that?""I'm glad your asked .Hhow do you feel about extra credit?"
2928,Jeremy,Yeah yeah totally .Whatever.
2929,Alaric,Good .Write me a paper then.
2930,Jeremy,Okay. About what?
2931,Alaric,"History. Pick a topic .Keep it local and no wikipedia regurgita. These old towns have a rich hostory so just... get your hands dirty ,make it sing and your back on track.Deal?"
2932,Jeremy,"Yeah. Deal ,.That's a cool ring."
2933,Alaric,"Oh thanks .It was my father's .A little garish ,but family. You know. You got a week."
2934,Jeremy, Yeah
2935,Matt,Hey
2936,Caroline,"Hey, What is that?"
2937,Matt,What is what?
2938,Caroline,"The ""hey"". That's twice That is two heys.That... do you have any other words in your vocabulary?"
2939,Matt,"What's wrong with ""hey""?"
2940,Caroline," It reeks of awkward subtext. You spent the night in my bed , there was ...cuddling and then you stuck out before dawn so you wouldn't have to face me, which I must say is a total lame guy that I did not appreciate.And now with the heys? Serously?I mean,I may have been some pathetic, insecure mess after the party but,do not mistake that for me being a pushover,because I do not let guys mess with my head anymore."
2941,Matt,I heard your mom in the morning and I didn't want to get you in trouble so I went out hte window.
2942,Caroline,You went out the window?Another lame guy move.
2943,Matt,"Your mom's the sheriff.And as for the heys , I'm pretty sure it's what I've said you every day since the first grade.Trying to read something into it ... lame girl move."
2944,Elena,You weren't in class.I was worried.
2945,Stefan,"I got your messages, and sorry I didn't get back to you, but...What I wanna say shouldn't be said over the phone."
2946,Elena,"A simple ""I didn't k*ll my brother"" text would have sufficed."
2947,Stefan,"I didn't k*ll my brither , as much as he deserved it.He has to thank you for that."
2948,Elena,So what did you wanna tell me?
2949,Stefan,I won't be comming to school anymore.I'm gonna back off and keep my distance.It's the right thing to do.
2950,Elena,Back off from school or...from me?Thank you for telling.
2951,Stefan,It's better this way.
2952,Elena,Yep.I got it.
2953,Stefan,You're angry .That's good.Be easier if you hate me.
2954,Damon,"Okay,it's your last chance."
2955,Bonnie,I'm gonna scream.
2956,Damon,Don't do that.Let's stay on point.I want my necklace.
2957,Bonnie,You can't have it.
2958,Damon,I can't take it but you can give it tome.I'm trying to help you here.
2959,Bonnie,I don't want your help.
2960,Damon,"You do want my help, and you don't even know it. You know why , you little witch?Cause you've stumbled into something you nee to stumble out of."
2961,Bonnie,Just leave me alone or I swear...
2962,Damon,"Don't.No threats.A, you hurt me last time.B, I wish you no harm.Believe it or not Bonnie,I wanna protect you.Let me help you get Emily off your Back."
2963,Bonnie,How do you know about her?
2964,Damon,"I know a lot of things, and I know more about that crystal than you do,and I know thas she's using it to creep inside of you.See how scared you are?And you should be,because I will get that crystal ,even if I have to wait for Emily to give ti to me herself.Next time she comes out to play, you tell her...That a deal's a deal."
2965,Bonnie,"He's bad news,elena.He really scared me."
2966,Elena,You need to stay as far away from Damon as possible.
2967,Bonnie,I'm trying.He just keeps showing up.
2968,Elena,I don't want you to be alone.You're sleeping at my place tonight.We can make a whole night out of it.Where are you going?Are you okay?
2969,Bonnie,Now I am.All my problems were because of that thing.Can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
2970,Elena,What's your Grams gonna say?
2971,Bonnie,"Grams isn't the one being haunted by a hundred and fifty-years-old ghost,is she?"
2972,Elena,"Okay,then."
2973,Jenna,I like a man who can dine Alone.A quiet strength.
2974,Jeremy,I thought you were still in that whole Logan depression thing.
2975,Jenna,"I've sworn off men forever,but it doesn't mean I can't observe them from a safe distance."
2976,Jeremy,"Well,I can introduce you."
2977,Elena,Thanks for coming.I wouldn't have called if it wasn't important.
2978,Stefan,I know that.
2979,Elena,"He threatened her,Stefan."
2980,Stefan,What would Damon want with Bonnie?
2981,Elena,"She has this necklace.Caroline got it from Damon,and she gave it Bonnie,and now Damon wants it back.He's tormenting her."
2982,Stefan,Over a necklace.
2983,Elena,it's not just any necklace.It has to do with Bonnie's heritage.it belonged to one of her ancestors who lived here during the civil w*r.When you and Damon lived here.
2984,Stefan,Her name was Emily.She was Katherine's handmaid and a witch.
2985,Elena,You know?About Bonnie?
2986,Stefan,"The first night that you invited me over for dinner,I made the connection."
2987,Elena,"And...now Damon knows,and...for some reason he wants that necklace."
2988,Stefan,What does it look like?
2989,Elena,It's...an antique iron setting with...
2990,Stefan,"With an amber crystal.I know it.It belonged to Katherine.Emily gave it to her,which means that..."
2991,Elena,What?
2992,Elena,Will he tell you?
2993,Stefan,I'll get it out of him.
2994,Jenna,Have you picked a topic?
2995,Jeremy,"No,not yet.It's gonna be local and non-internet research,so..."
2996,Jenna,That's easy.You got all your dad's stuff.
2997,Jeremy,What stuff?
2998,Jenna,"How the Gilberts came over on the Mayflower stuff,all that family lineage from way back.Your dad really loved all that family history stuff.It's all boxed up in the closet."
2999,Jeremy,Mister Saltzaman.
3000,Alaric,"Jeremy.What's up,man?"
3001,Jeremy,This is my aunt Jenna.
3002,Alaric,Alaric Saltzman.It's nice to meet you.
3003,Jenna,Jeremy was just telling me about his paper.Thanks for giving him another chance.
3004,Alaric,It was my first day.I wanted to make a good impression.
3005,Stefan,"So Stefan...You know,I been thinking.I think we should start over,give this brother thing another chance.We used to do it ,oh, so well once upon time."
3006,Damon,"I don't ,Damon.I can't trust you to be a nice guy.You k*ll everybody,and you're so mean.You're so mean,and...You're really hard to imitate,and then I have to go to that lesser place."
3007,Stefan,"Can I get a coffee,please?So what's with the bottle?"
3008,Damon,"I'm on edge.Crash diet,and I'm trying to keep a low profile."
3009,Stefan,"You could always just leave, find a new town to turn into your own personal gas and sip."
3010,Damon,"I""ll manage.You don't have to keep an eye on me."
3011,Stefan,I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
3012,Damon,So why are you here?
3013,Stefan,Why not?
3014,Caroline,"I'm sorry.There.I said it.If you want the ugly-ass neclace,keep it.It's yours"
3015,Bonnie,Will you hate me if I tell you I threw it away?
3016,Caroline,You threw it away?
3017,Bonnie,I know it sounds crazy but the necklace was giving me nightmares.I had to get rid of it.
3018,Caroline,You could have just given it back to me.
3019,Elena,Why?So you could give it back to Damon?
3020,Caroline,Screw Damon.Are we doing manicures or what?Who has their kit?
3021,Bonnie,Mine's in my bag.
3022,Caroline,So Elena.How long do you think this fight with Stefan's gonna last?Is it...like a permanent thing?
3023,Elena,I don't know Caroline.
3024,Caroline,"Why are you such a little liar,Bonnie?"
3025,Bonnie,What?
3026,Elena,Caroline!
3027,Bonnie,"I'm not Lying to you,Caroline.I swear."
3028,Elena,It's true.I watched her throw it into a field.
3029,Caroline,Then explain it.
3030,Bonnie,Emily.
3031,Caroline,Who's Emily?
3032,Bonnie,The ghost.
3033,Caroline,The ghost has a name now?
3034,Elena,"Caroline,please."
3035,Bonnie,I wonder why she won't leave me alone.
3036,Caroline,What is going on?Why am I not a part of this conversation?You guys do this to me all the time.
3037,Elena,That's not true.
3038,Bonnie,Yes it is. I can't talk to you.You don't listen.
3039,Caroline,That's not true.
3040,Bonnie,I'm a witch.
3041,Caroline,And don't we all know it?
3042,Bonnie,See?That's what I'm talking about.I'm trying to tell you something.You don't even hear it.
3043,Caroline,I listen.When do I not listen?
3044,Jenna,Jeremy totally ditched me.
3045,Alaric,Where's he go?
3046,Jenna,Home.It's not far.He can walk it.
3047,Alaric,So are you from here?Are you a townie?
3048,Jenna,I'm a returnee.Left town for a while.Now I'm back.
3049,Alaric,Why'd you leave?
3050,Jenna,School.And then there's the real reason.I was wronged..Guy named Logan.
3051,Alaric,What'd he do?
3052,Jenna,"Basics...Lied,cheated,lured me back in , left me again.Your turn.Any sad relationship stories?"
3053,Alaric,"The basics...Fell in Love,married young,my wife died."
3054,Jenna,Oh.Waouh.
3055,Alaric,That's always a good conversation stopper.
3056,Jenna,What happened?
3057,Alaric,"Well,you,me and the ... North Carolina department are all wondering the same thing.It's what's known as a cold case."
3058,Jenna,So why'd you move here?
3059,Alaric,"A change of pace,new scenery.I like it here.It's ... got a rich story."
3060,Damon,Lucky sh*t.
3061,Stefan,More like a carefully honed k*ll over many decades.
3062,Damon,You're b*at me.
3063,Stefan,Yeah.It's because I'm better than you.
3064,Damon,"I'm onto you.Reverse psychology.It's a little transparent, but I admire the effort."
3065,Stefan,You prefer the brooding forehead?
3066,Damon,"Seriously , what game do you think you're playing?"
3067,Stefan,That's funny question considering the fact that I have been asking you that for month.It's frustrating isn't it?
3068,Damon,Touché.
3069,Caroline,"Bonnie.Look it's just not me.I don't believe in the...But if you do,then...Okay.I'm in.That's all it takes for me to jump onboard,because I consider you to be my best friend.And I'm saying this knowing that Elena's in the kitchen listening to my every word.I didn't know how this was for you,but I'm listening now.Elena ,you can come in now.We're done.There is just way too much drama in this room.So what do you guys wanna do?I have an idea.Why don't we have a séance?"
3070,Bonnie,I don't think that's a good idea.
3071,Caroline,Come on.Let's summon some spirits.This Emily chick has some serious explaning to do.
3072,Bonnie,What are we doing?
3073,Elena,I don't know.
3074,Caroline,Be quiet and concentrate.Close your eyes.Now take a deep breathe.Bonnie Call to her.
3075,Bonnie,Emily you there?
3076,Caroline,"Really?""Emily you there?""That's all you got? Come on.Fine .Jeez."
3077,Bonnie,Emily I call on you.I know you have a message.I'm here to listen.
3078,Elena,Did that just...
3079,Caroline,Yeah.it just happened.
3080,Bonnie,It's just air conditioning.
3081,Caroline,"Ask her to show you a sign .Ask her.Emily if you're among us,show us another sign."
3082,Bonnie,See?It's not working.I can't I'm done.Get the light.Please get the light on.
3083,Elena,Hold on.I got it.
3084,Bonnie,"You guys,the necklace ,it's gone."
3085,Damon,What are we doin' here?Bonding.Catch.Go on.
3086,Stefan,Give it a try.
3087,Damon,Don't forget who taught you how to play this game.That hurt.
3088,Stefan,Downside of my diet ...getting hit actually hurts a little bit.
3089,Damon,"I'm impressed Stefan.Fun Booze and darts,sentimental football,and now starry night.What do you want,Stefan?"
3090,Stefan,"It wasn't real,Damon.Our love for Katherine.She compelled us.We didn't have a choice.Took mr years to sort that out,to trully understand what she did to us."
3091,Damon,We are not takin' that tonight.
3092,Stefan,What do you want with Katherine's crystal.
3093,Damon,How do you know about that?
3094,Stefan,Come on.You knew Elena would tell me.
3095,Damon,How do you know it was Katherine's?
3096,Stefan,"Emily gave it to her on her last night.I was with her,and you weren't.I was the last one to see her.Now ,what do you want with Ktherine's crystal?"
3097,Damon,She didn't tell you?
3098,Stefan,We had other things on our mind.
3099,Damon,I could rip your heart out and not think twice about it.
3100,Stefan,I've heard that before.
3101,Damon,"I have a bigger surprise,Stefan.I'm gonna bring her back."
3102,Elena,"Fun's over ,Caroline.You made a point,and I get it.Now give it back."
3103,Caroline,"What?well,I didn't have it.What ? What happened?"
3104,Elena,I don't know.Nothing.Jeremy are you home?
3105,Bonnie,Guys...[The door get close]You guys open the door.Help me.
3106,Elena,"What's going on,Bonnie."
3107,Caroline,Bonnie!
3108,Elena,Try the other door.I'll check the hallway.
3109,Caroline,Bonnie!Bonnie! Unlock the door!
3110,Elena,Bonnie!Bonnie!Bonnie!Open the door!
3111,Elena,What happened?Are you okay ?
3112,Bonnie/Emily,I'm fine.
3113,Caroline,Unbelievable.You were totally faking it.
3114,Elena,Caroline.Come on.
3115,Caroline,"No,you scared the hell out of me."
3116,Elena,Bonnie?
3117,Bonnie/Emily,I'm fine.Everything's fine.
3118,Stefan,How can you bring Katherine back?
3119,Damon,"Before Katherine and the others were k*ll in the church,you remember what it was like in this town?"
3120,Stefan,I remember the fear and the hysteria.
3121,Damon,"Townspeople were k*ll vampires one by one.When they came for Katherine,I went straight to Emily,said,""I'll do anything.Name your price;Just protect her.""She did."
3122,Stefan,How?
3123,Damon,"She did some kind of spell with the crystal.And while the church was burning, we thought Katherine was burning in it.She wasn't."
3124,Stefan,But I saw her go inside.
3125,Damon,"There's a tomb underneath the church.The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb,protecting her."
3126,Stefan,Are you telling me that Katherine's alive?
3127,Damon,"If that's what you wanna call it.She's been trappes in a mystical holding cell for the last century and a half ,but you're an expert on a starving a vampire,so how do you thnik she's doing ,Stefan?Did you know that witches can use celestial events to draw energy into their magic?Me either.But in order to give the crystal power,emily used the comet that was passing overhead,and in order for that crystal to work again..."
3128,Stefan,The comet had to return.
3129,Damon,"Downside...Long time it between comets and a couple of hiccups along the way with the crystal but the comet passed,and I got the crystal.And then Caroline got the crystal,and now Bonnie has the crystal and here we are."
3130,Stefan,Why would Emily...Why would she do this for you?
3131,Damon,"Because she knew they were gonna come for her,too,and she made me promise that her lineage would survive."
3132,Stefan,I remember.You saved her children.
3133,Damon,It's the only thing keeping me from ripping that little Bonnie girl's throat out to get my crystal back.Well.A deal's a deal.So...You wanna go throw some more?
3134,Caroline, I can't believe I fell for it.
3135,Elena,Are you okay?
3136,Bonnie/Emily,I must go.
3137,Caroline,She's leaving.I'm leaving.
3138,Elena,You guys can't leave.
3139,Caroline,I can.I've had enough freaky fake witch stuff for one night.
3140,Bonnie/Emily,Thank you for having me.I'll take it from here?
3141,Elena,Where are you going?
3142,Bonnie/Emily,Back to where it all began.
3143,Elena,Bonnie!Bonnie!Oh My God!Emily!
3144,Bonnie/Emily,I won't let him have it.It must be destroyed.
3145,Elena,Wait!
3146,Caroline,What's happening?
3147,Elena,"I don't know.The door,it's not..."
3148,Jeremy,What the hell?
3149,Caroline,I'm outta here.
3150,Stefan,What's wrong?
3151,Elena,It's Bonnie
3152,Stefan,What happened?
3153,Elena,Emily is possessing her.She said something.
3154,Stefan,What did she say?
3155,Elena," She said ""I won't let him have it.It must be destroyed.And then she just left."
3156,Stefan,Where do you think she went?
3157,Elena," I don't know.Fell's church,by the old cemetery that's where she took Bonnie in her dreams.We have to help her,Stefan."
3158,Stefan,Just stay there.I'm gonna go find her.
3159,Damon,Hello Emily.You look different.
3160,Bonnie/Emily,I won't let you do it.
3161,Damon,We had a deal.
3162,Bonnie/Emily,Things are different now.I need to protect my family.
3163,Damon,I protected your family.You owe me.
3164,Bonnie/Emily,I know.I'm sorry.
3165,Damon,You're about to be a lot more than that.
3166,Jenna,You're so wrong.I'm much more pathetic.
3167,Alaric,Oh non no no.I've got you b*at.I have pathetic down to a science.
3168,Jenna,"Oh no.We haven't even covered high school.Braces,""A""Cup."
3169,Alaric,"Glasses,skin condition."
3170,Jenna,You can...You know what ?I'm not gonna invite you in.
3171,Alaric,"Well,some other time then.Have a good night Jenna."
3172,Jenna,So you found the boxes.
3173,Jeremy,"I found this,too."
3174,Jenna,Me and Logan.That's cruel.
3175,Jeremy,Cruel is dating my history teacher.
3176,Jenna,I'm not dating him.Yet.
3177,Damon,It hurts.This is why I feed on people.
3178,Bonnie/Emily,Stefan.
3179,Stefan,Hello Emily.
3180,Bonnie/Emily,These people don't deserve this.They should never have to know such evil.
3181,Stefan,What do you mean evil?
3182,Damon,Emily.I swear to God I'll make you regret this.
3183,Bonnie/Emily,I won't let you unleash them into this world.
3184,Stefan,Them?What part of the story did you lelee out?
3185,Damon,What does it matter?
3186,Stefan,"Emily,tell me what you did."
3187,Bonnie/Emily,"To save her,I had to save them."
3188,Stefan,You saved everyone in the church?
3189,Bonnie/Emily,With ones comes all.
3190,Damon,I don't care about that.I just want katherine.
3191,Stefan,"I knew I shouldn't have believed a single word that comes out of your mouth.This isn't about love,is it?This is about revenge."
3192,Damon,The two aren't mutually exclusive.
3193,Stefan,"Damon,you can't do this."
3194,Damon,"Why not?They k*ll 27 people,and they called it a w*r battle.They deserve whatever they get."
3195,Stefan,"27 Vampires,damon.They were vampires.You can't just bring them back."
3196,Damon,This town deserves this.
3197,Stefan,You're blaming innocent people for something that happened 145 years ago.
3198,Damon,"There is nothing innocent about these people,and don't thnik for a second it won't happen again.They already know too much,and they'll burn your little grandwitch right next to us when they find out.Trust me."
3199,Bonnie/Emily,Things are different now.
3200,Damon,Don't do this.
3201,Bonnie/Emily,I can't free them.I won't.Incendia!
3202,Damon,No!No please.
3203,Elena,Bonnie!
3204,Damon,No!
3205,Stefan,"She's alive,but barely.I can save her."
3206,Elena,"Her neck,it's healing."
3207,Matt,Hey
3208,Caroline,What are you doing here?
3209,Matt,Your window was open.I thought you should know.
3210,Caroline,Not Funny.
3211,Matt,"Earlier today,I lied."
3212,Caroline,About?
3213,Matt,About being in bed with you.We cuddled and it creeped me out.
3214,Caroline,"It creeped you out?I mean,did you just come over here to insult me or what?Because it's been a really long night."
3215,Matt,"It's just that...I don't like you.Inever have,but...it was nice."
3216,Caroline,What?
3217,Matt,"Being in bed with you,it felt nice.And so ,I was thinkin about it,and I thought that I could tell you I stayed because you were all sad and alone and I felt bad for you."
3218,Caroline,"Well,thank you,cause I love being a charity case.You can leave now."
3219,Matt,"No,because I know...with Vicki gone and my mom off with...Pete whoever,it's just me,so...I know it."
3220,Damon,Katherine never compelled me.I knew everything every step of the way.It was real for me.I'll leave now.
3221,Bonnie,"I don't understand ,Elena,what happened to me.He attacked me,and...his face was like..."
3222,Elena,How do you feel?Are you okay?
3223,Bonnie,I'm fine.It's just this bl*od.I don't...
3224,Stefan,I'm not gonna hurt you.
3225,Bonnie,What's going on?
3226,Elena,I'll explain everything.Okay? Let's just get out of here.Look at me.Trust me.He's not going to hurt you.Come on.Come on.Is she in danger of becoming...
3227,Stefan,"No,she has to die with my bl*od in her system,so keep an eye on her tonight and make sure that nothing happens and once it leaves her system,she'll be fine."
3228,Elena,I'm gonna tell her the truth.
3229,Stefan,Are you Sure?
3230,Elena,"I can trust her.I need someone to know,someone to talk to.I can't live in secret."
3231,Stefan,I know that.Shouldn't have to.
3232,Elena,"You saved her life.I'm sorry ,Stefan.I thought that ...I couldn't be with you,but I can.You don't have to push me away.I can do this."
3233,Stefan,I can't.I have to leave.Too many people have died.Too much has happened.
3234,Elena,What?No.I know you think you're protecting me but...
3235,Stefan,I have to .Coming home was...it was a mistake.I can't be a part of your life anymore.
3236,Elena,Don't go Stefan.Please...You don't have to.This is your home.Please don't go.
3237,Stefan,"Good-bye,Elena."
3238,Elena,"You're just gonna walk away?Don't walk away,Stefan!"
3239,Logan,Hello Jenna.
3240,Jenna,Logan!
3241,Logan,Aren't you gonna invite me in?
3242,Jenna, Why are you here Logan?
3243,Logan, I missed you. I was out of town.
3244,Jenna," yeah, I got the email!"
3245,Logan, you got an email?
3246,Jenna, You didn't send an email?
3247,Logan, I can explain. Just invite me in and I tell you everything.
3248,Jenna, I'm not gonna invite you in. Forget it!
3249,Logan, come on Jenna. It's me!
3250,Jenna, the answer is no!
3251,Logan," I know you. You're always one step from ""maybe"", tidy nasty ""yes"""
3252,Jenna, you've just pointed it out that I've no self-control. Clever strategy!
3253,A neighbor, Good evening!
3254,The woman," hey, you're the guy from the news, Logan Fell. I watch you every night. Oh, I used to, I mean. You've been missing from my TV."
3255,Logan, I took some time off.
3256,The woman, I noticed. I'm Daphne.
3257,Logan," hey you know something, Daphne?"
3258,The woman," No, what?"
3259,Elena, Jeremy is gonna sketch pad note.
3260,Jenna, You're kidding?
3261,Elena," Nope but don't say word. The minute we encourage him, he'll put it away."
3262,Jenna, psychology major. Check that!
3263,Jenna, You and Stefan? Update?
3264,Elena," He knows how I feel and works and I know where he stands and it doesn't matter. He's leaving, moving away."
3265,Jenna, Where is he going?
3266,Elena, I stopped asking questions. The answers get scary.
3267,Jenna," your leaves, mine returns."
3268,Elena, Logan?
3269,Jenna, He's back. I didn't let him pass my door.
3270,Elena, Hope you slam down his face

3273,Jenna, exactly! No more Logan slam Fell
3274,[Salvatore's house, living room]
3275,Stefan, so any ideas where you go?
3276,Damon," I don't know. London, maybe! See some friends."
3277,Stefan," You don't have any friends, Damon."
3278,Damon," you're right Stefan. I only have you. So, where we're going?"
3279,Stefan, WE are not going anywhere. I'm gonna live my life as far away from you as possible.
3280,Damon," but we're team! We could travel the world together. We can try ""The Amazing race"""
3281,Stefan," That's fine! Seriously, where you're going because we are not staying in this town."
3282,Sheriff, I'm here to see Damon
3283,Stefan," Sure, OK."
3284,Damon," sheriff, what surprise!"
3285,Sheriff, sorry to bother you but we need to talk
3286,Damon, come in.
3287,Damon, I hope you understand the secrecy. Stef doesn't know about this yet and I'd like to keep it that way.
3288,Sheriff," of course, kids are too young to be brought into this."
3289,Damon," so, what you need?"
3290,Sheriff," there's been another attack. A female v*ctim, throat tore out, completely drained of bl*od. If it's repeater…"
3291,Damon, I'm sorry I don't understand. I thought we solved that problem when…. I staked the blond one
3292,Sheriff," I think that she must have turned someone, a multiple someone. I don't know. The story for the town is another animal attack but I'm not sure how long we can keep lying to them. The council is on up board. We thought we were passed this."
3293,Damon," and so, what we do?"
3294,Sheriff, you're the only one who has never taken on a vampire. We were hoping you could tell us.
3295,Matt, and the bally dance and the Krumper of salsa
3296,Caroline, I was awake for that way
3297,Matt," oh I don't know when you feel asleep. Hum, did you see the Celine Dion waltz about cancer?"
3298,Caroline, those always make me cry!
3299,Matt, and then the judge can screaming and I can take it so I turned it off
3300,Caroline," I saw ‘the family guy', so you hold me"
3301,[School, Elena & Bonnie]
3302,Elena, did I miss something?
3303,Bonnie, they've been hanging out
3304,Elena," kind of weird, don't you think?"
3305,Bonnie, she needs someone nice like him as opposed to a vampire like Damon.
3306,Elena," yeah, how are you doing with all that?"
3307,Bonnie, I'm freak out. Damon attacked me and I could be death right now but I'm also grateful.
3308,Elena, hum?
3309,Bonnie," to Stefan. He saved my life, and… Have you seen him?"
3310,Elena," No since he's used he's leaving. For all I know, he's probably gone."
3311,Bonnie, He wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
3312,Elena," yes, he will. He thinks he's protecting me: a clean break and all that."
3313,Bonnie, so what're gonna do?
3314,Elena," what am I supposed to do? I've already beg to don't go. If I ask him, I'm being self-fish. It is what it is."
3315,Bonnie," maybe, it's for the best!"
3316,Elena, what? Why?
3317,Bonnie, I mean what kind of future could you have with him even if he stayed?
3318,Elena, did you…
3319,Bonnie," no, I swear."
3320,Damon, Thank you for stepping by.
3321,Sheriff, let me know if you come on this
3322,Damon, Absolutely
3323,Stefan, what's wrong with you? You k*ll somebody?
3324,Damon, get off of me!
3325,Stefan, that's impossible.
3326,Damon, obviously not!
3327,Stefan, who could it be?
3328,Damon," what do we care? We're leaving anyway, right?"
3329,Stefan," no, I can't leave now and you know that. How are we supposed to find this person?"
3330,Damon, don't handle with this stuffs
3331,A girl," see you later, ok. Bye."
3332,Elena, bye.
3333,Stefan, Hi. We need to talk.
3334,Tyler, So what's up with you and Forbes?
3335,Matt, nothing about
3336,Tyler," I saw you in the hall today. Don't even try denied, bro. You type her."
3337,Matt," no, it's not like that!"
3338,Tyler," never is until it comes ""we"""
3339,Matt," ""we"" people?"
3340,Tyler," yeah, ""we can make to the party""; ""we never miss a game""; ""we don't like the color red"""
3341,Matt, we are not like twice
3342,Tyler," like I said ""we"""
3343,Elena, so you have no idea who it could be?
3344,Stefan," none, but it must somebody now because leaving a body like that….rather sloppy or he tries to send a message."
3345,Elena, are you sure it's not Damon?
3346,Stefan," I'm never sure about Damon, but he's been trying to keep low profile so it's just doesn't make any sense to me."
3347,Elena, so what are you gonna do?
3348,Stefan," Damon is tracking now, right now. Look I promise you the truth so I wanna to tell you. I want you to be careful."
3349,Elena," when I saw you, I thought you were coming to say goodbye."
3350,Stefan, not yet!
3351,[At Jeremy's, living room]
3352,Jeremy, hey what do you think?
3353,Jenna, creepy
3354,Jeremy," I found this old journal in dad's stuffs, Jonathan Gilbert from the 1800. It's kind of a freak show. He wrote about demons and all of these people getting slaughter and…"
3355,Jenna," yeah, he was a writer… short stories, horror stuffs."
3356,Jeremy, he wrote fictions? Think he was just a limited or a drunk.
3357,Jenna," he was a Gilbert, probably a little bite of both."
3358,Caroline, So what we do now?
3359,Damon, Just wait. I'll be there in a…
3360,Caroline, can you hurry? I've things to do.
3361,Damon, can you give me then?
3362,Caroline, so what did you need me to do this?
3363,Damon, Because I interfere the signal
3364,Caroline, Can I go now? This is b*rned out the half of my day.
3365,Damon, you do that! Take your car and go home. And forget me to ask you to do this!
3366,Caroline," ok, bye now"
3367,Damon, bye
3368,Logan, I've tons of these wood boots so nothing funky
3369,Damon," you don't wanna do this, trust me."
3370,Logan, that's what you get
3371,Damon, for what?
3372,Logan, you make me like this!
3373,Damon, I k*ll you. I didn't turn you.
3374,Logan, See I know you and your brother are. I've watching the 2 of you. I knew you appear and I glad that you did because I've some questions.
3375,Damon, me first. Who turns you?
3376,Logan," how should I know? Last thing I remember, it's about to stake your brother and then you crapped me. That's it! Until I wake up in the ground behind a used car dealership on highway 4. Somebody buried me."
3377,Damon, It happens.
3378,Logan, you bite me. It had to be you!
3379,Damon," Lift a vampire bl*od system when you died. I didn't do that! Some other vampires find you, give you them bl*od."
3380,Logan, who?
3381,Damon, that's what I wanna know
3382,Logan," dude, it's like the welcome wagon was waiting with a pancake and a handbook. It's been a learning huge go process. One minute, I'm a small town on the rise news guy and next thing I know, I can't get into my house because my full bulk don't go through the door."
3383,Damon, you have to be invited in.
3384,Logan, I know. I leave alone.
3385,Damon," Oh, That sucks!"
3386,Logan," so now, I am at the Ramada, watching papers view all day, eating everything inside including house-keeping"
3387,Damon, it could be worst!
3388,Logan," all I can think about its bl*od and k*ll people. I can't stop k*ll people, I can keep k*ll and I like it. I'm conflicted."
3389,Damon, welcome to the club. Wait! Cobs found one body.
3390,Logan, I left one. I was tired but I've hidden the rest of bodies. There were back there.
3391,Damon, you're kidding?
3392,Logan, they pile up.
3393,Maier, so what do we know?
3394,Sheriff, nothing in the report again. My highly reliable deputies are on their work but if you feel the need to be more proactive by all means perhaps a stake and have them.
3395,Maier, What cautions college is it gonna take?
3396,Sheriff," for right now, there is no more safe in the crowded public place and for once, actually, we know where our kids are."
3397,[School, Tyler & Jeremy]
3398,Tyler, what do you want?
3399,Jeremy," hey, I'm just surprise to see you here. Art usually implies culture and culture implies, eh, not you."
3400,Tyler, go the hell!
3401,Elena, Still wanna be an astronaut?
3402,Matt, I can't believe you remember that.
3403,Elena, I can remember the tinfoil you wore on your head.
3404,Matt, I was eight
3405,Elena, how are you doing?
3406,Matt, it has been easier. You? I heard some times. So it's true than you and Stefan…
3407,Elena," yes, it is. What about you, Matt Donovan? I heard about Caroline."
3408,Matt," oh men, not you too. We're friends. It's not a big deal."
3409,Elena, No?
3410,Matt, No.
3411,Logan, why am I so overly emotional? I can think about my ex-girlfriend. I wanna be with her and bite her and stuff.
3412,Damon, you may probably love her. Anything you felt before will be magnified now. You've to learn how to control that!
3413,Logan," what about walking on the sun? I'm a morning person. You can walk on the sun which is by the way, is pretty cool. The council will never suspect you. That's not in the journals."
3414,Damon, the journals?
3415,Logan," yeah, the founding fathers said pass out journals to the kids. Come on men, you get to tell me. How can you walk around in the sun?"
3416,Damon, who turned you?
3417,Logan, how do you walk in the sun?
3418,Damon, who turned you?
3419,Logan," you know, I've been really nice so far but I will k*ll you!"
3420,Damon, and you never know. You don't answer my question!
3421,Logan, you first!
3422,Damon," it seems we have been in an impasse then, doesn't it?"
3423,Logan," I've things to do, people to k*ll. Guess I have been a longer length start."
3424,Elena, I'm guessing you're not here to plan future. You're looking out for me
3425,Stefan," hope that's ok. You know I wanted to be a doctor before it happened, but I couldn't"
3426,Elena, the bl*od
3427,Stefan," yeah, I've dubbed thing, fun of different things so."
3428,Elena, you didn't love anything enough to sleep to it.
3429,Stefan, no I loved that all. It's just…I had to move on before anybody can notice that I wasn't getting any older.
3430,Elena, how long before that would happen?
3431,Stefan," few years, usually. Sometimes shorter"
3432,Elena, and you always left
3433,Stefan," I haven't the choice. So, what about, what about you? Any plan for the future?"
3434,Elena, I don't wanna talk about my future Stefan because everything you're saying is making a perfect life where you're not gonna be in.
3435,Stefan," Elena, it's not that I don't wanna be in"
3436,Elena," you can't, I get it! I've heard you the first time and the second time and I appreciate you're looking out for me but please, if you're gone leave, then just go."
3437,Jenna, hide me.
3438,Elena, what's going on?
3439,Jenna, this scum Fell has landed.
3440,Elena, Logan's here?
3441,Stefan," wait, Logan Fell?"
3442,Elena," Stefan, what's going on?"
3443,Logan," Jenna, you're dodging me!"
3444,Jenna, it's a form of self-preservation.
3445,Stefan," Elena, why you and Jenna don't go somewhere else?"
3446,Elena, let's go.
3447,Stefan, what are you doing here?
3448,Logan," you know, your brother asked me the same thing. In fact, why don't we just keep pass the all leg who turned me stuff to get the answer that I want? How can I turn into a day walker?"
3449,Stefan, Damon and I are the only keepers that know it.
3450,Logan," But you both are cagey on the how which tells me that there is a way. You know. In case that you haven't noticed, I'm quite a celebrity in this town. It would be very, very easy for me to expose you."
3451,Stefan, you wanna know how you can walk around in the sun?
3452,Logan, I do
3453,Stefan, You can't. Don't ever threat me again!
3454,Elena," when Logan came to the house, what did he say?"
3455,Jenna," fake flattery and stupid deepen grin, puppy dog eyes."
3456,Elena, I'm serious Jenna. How did he act? What did he say?
3457,Jenna," he's usual Logan, charming, a little more maniac than usual. He kept try to convince me to let him in. What?"
3458,Elena," Ok, listen to me very carefully. Do not, in any circumstances, talk to him again. I'm serious, Jenna, look ever!"
3459,Alaric, hey Elena. Jenna
3460,Elena, Hey Mister Saltzman.
3461,Alaric, I hoped to see you again.
3462,Jenna, carrier's night is the new bowling.
3463,Elena," ok, excuse me."
3464,Damon," Logan Fell is a vampire and when I found him again, I'm gonna destroy him limb by limb."
3465,Stefan, What happened? Do you ok?
3466,Damon," no, I'm not ok! I was embellished; I was sh*t. Now, I'm vengable. Just got to find them."
3467,Stefan, there is no need. He's here in school.
3468,Damon, you're kidding me? Why the hell is he there?
3469,Stefan, he's working crowd.
3470,Damon," well, I'll be right there."
3471,Elena (to Stefan)," so, anything you'd like to share?"
3472,Sheriff, what are you doing?
3473,Caroline, I'm founding my future. There it is.
3474,Sheriff, broadcast journalism?
3475,Caroline, yes! Broadcast journalism. Why are you looking at me like that?
3476,Sheriff, you don't even read paper.
3477,Logan, Liz
3478,Sheriff, Logan
3479,Logan, what you're gonna do: Stake me; bury me in another shallow grave? What the email say this time?
3480,Sheriff, I've not the choice.
3481,Logan," you…Bitch! I died for you, for this town. You've known me since I was 6 and you swept me under the rock like dirt."
3482,Sheriff, You know where you're getting it.
3483,Logan, I was one of you
3484,Sheriff," now, you're one of them."
3485,Logan," watch your back, sheriff!"
3486,Sheriff, Get a backup team at the school immediately. Keep it within the circle. It's a V5.
3487,Jeremy, I didn't know you drew
3488,Tyler, it's an elective.
3489,Jeremy, because it's good stuffs. You like graphics? Because…it's kind of my thing.

3502,Logan," that's not a problem, really. It's on the way."
3503,Caroline, this is fate.
3504,Logan, and why Is that?

3530,Sheriff, what do you want?
3531,Logan, the satisfaction turning your daughter into a vampire.
3532,Damon," payback is a bitch, is it? Get her out of here."
3533,Sheriff (on the phone)," Logan, what happened?"
3534,Damon (phone)," Sheriff, yeah, it's Damon."

3543,Damon," oh well, you screwed!"
3544,Logan, wait. I do know!
3545,Damon, you're lying.
3546,Logan, you think you're the only one of us to get in that tomb in the navy old church?
3547,Damon," If you lie me, I'll end you."
3548,Logan, I'm not lying. There is another way to break the spell. We can help you. Meet me at the old church.
3549,Damon, take me off. Makes look crap. Makes it look real!
3550,Sheriff, where is she?

3564,Jeremy," I don't know. I thought that it was weird with your dad, what he did. Is he like that all the time? Is that…Is that what you go through? Men I get it. I get it. What's your problem?"
3565,Tyler, I don't need your pie.
3566,Jeremy, seriously you don't have to be like that.
3567,Tyler, just go!
3568,Jeremy," What is your problem, men?"
3569,Tyler, I don't know. Ok. I don't know.
3570,Elena," what I said before your leaving, it was harch."
3571,Stefan," no, you've every right."
3572,Elena," you asked me what I want it my future to be. I wanted to be a writer. My mum, a sort of push me in that direction from the time I was able to read. She's supported me, encouraged me, bought my first journal, and then she died. And I can't see myself being a writer anymore. That was something that we shared. I know you think you put all of these bad stuffs in my life but my life already had it. I was barred in it."
3573,Stefan, this is different.
3574,Elena, it doesn't make any less painful.
3575,Stefan, I know that it's hard to understand but I'm doing this for you.
3576,Elena," No, you don't get to make the decision for me. If you walk away, it's for you because I know what I want. Stefan, I love you."
3577,Elena, don't
3578,Stefan," Elena, I can't"
3579,Elena," yes, you can. Don't hide from me."

3585,Alaric," By the way, here I am"
3586,Logan, what do you want?
3587,Alaric, Jenna is a good person. She deserves the best. I make sure she gets it
3588,Logan, is that supposed to be a threat? Could you throat punch? Maybe provoke me a little?
3589,Alaric, I'm a violent guy by design.
3590,Logan, you're not a very smart one neither
3591,Alaric, How's that?
3592,Logan, because you've no idea who you're talking to
3593,Tyler, I need a ride
3594,Matt," sure. Look, I like Caroline. She's got this thing….this way butter….and I like her ok? I'm not gonna defending or apologize about."

3599,Elena, I've never been in your room before.
3600,Stefan, it hasn't changed much over years.
3601,Elena, do you leave everything here when you come and go?
3602,Stefan, it's the only place that…that remains constant. This room holds all the memories that I left was important enough to hold on to. 
3603,Elena, lot of memories
3604,Stefan, yeah. Are you dirty or anything?
3605,Elena, a little. You?
3606,Stefan, I' m fine. I'm getting you some drink ok?

3614,Stefan, Elena?
3615,STEFAN (PHONE)," Elena. It's Stefan. I know that picture must have confused you. But I can explain. I need to explain. Please, when you get this, call me."
3616,ELENA, Aah! Aah! Aah!

3618,ELENA, Damon?
3619,DAMON, You look stuck.
3620,ELENA, My seat lt.
3621,DAMON," Let me get you out of there. I want you to put your hands on the roof. Just like that. You ready? ...2, 3. I got you. Are you ok? Can you stand? Anything broken?"
3622,ELENA, Uh-uh.
3623,DAMON," Whoa, you're fading fast, Elena. Elena, look at me. Focus. Look at me. Ok."
3624,ELENA, I look like her.
3625,DAMON, What? Upsy-daisy.
3626,ALARIC," I found one. After years of reseah and study, there it was right in front of me. I was terrified. As I stared it in the eyes, I drove a stake through its heart. I was right about Mystic Falls. There is evil here. I can sense it. Feel it. It's everywhere."
3627,ALARIC'S GIRLFRIEND, Mmm. It's not even 7:00 yet.
3628,ALARIC, Which means you shouldn't be awake for at least 6 hours.
3629,ALARIC'S GIRLFRIEND, I hate morning people.
3630,ALARIC, I'm going to be home te tonight.
3631,ALARIC'S GIRLFRIEND, Mm love you.
3632,ALARIC, And I love you too.
3633,DAMON, Morning.
3634,ELENA, Where are we?
3635,DAMON, Georgia.
3636,ELENA," Georgia? No, no. No, we're not. Seriously, Damon. Where are we?"
3637,DAMON," Seriously, we're-- we're in Georgia. How ya feeling?"
3638,ELENA, I--I--
3639,DAMON, There's broken bones. I checked.
3640,ELENA, But my car. There was a man. I hit a man. But then he got up and--who was that?
3641,DAMON, That's what I would like to know.
3642,ELENA," Where is my phone? Ok. We really need to go back. Nobody knows where I am. Pull over. I mean it, damon. Pull over! Stop the car!"
3643,DAMON, Oh you were so much more fun when you were asleep.
3644,DAMON, Hey.
3645,ELENA, I'm fine. We have to go back.
3646,DAMON, Oh come on. Look. We've already come this far.
3647,ELENA, Why are you doing this? I can't be in Georgia. I wrecked my car. I have to go home. This is kidnapping.
3648,DAMON," That's a little melodramatic, don'you think?"
3649,ELENA, You're not funny. You can't do this. I'm not going to Georgia.
3650,DAMON, You're in georgia. Without your magical necklace I might add. I can very easily make you...Agreeable.
3651,ELENA, What are you trying to prove?
3652,ELENA, That's my phone.
3653,DAMON, Mmm. It's your boyfriend. I'll take it. Elena's phone.
3654,STEFAN, Where is she? Why do you have her phone? Is she ok?
3655,DAMON," Elena? She's right here. And, yes, she's fine."
3656,STEFAN, Where are you? Let me speak to her.
3657,DAMON, He wants to talk to you.
3658,ELENA, Uh-uh.
3659,DAMON, Yeah. I don't-- I don't think she wants to talk to you right now.
3660,STEFAN," Damon, I swear to god, if you touch her--"
3661,DAMON, You have a good day. Mm-hmm. Bye-now.
3662,STEFAN, Argh!
3663,ELENA, Look. No one knows where I am. Can we please just go back?
3664,DAMON, We're almost there.
3665,ELENA, Where is there?!
3666,DAMON," A little place right outside of Atlanta. Oh, come on, Elena. You don't wanna go back right now. Do you? What's the rush? Time-out. Trust me. Your problems are still going to be there when you get home. Look. Step away from your life for 5 minutes."
3667,ELENA, 5 minutes. Am I going to be safe with you?
3668,DAMON, Yes.
3669,ELENA, Will you promise not to do that mind control thing with me?
3670,DAMON, Yes.
3671,ELENA, Can I trust you?
3672,DAMON, Get in the car. Come on.
3673,JEREMY," Hey, Mr. Saltzman."
3674,ALARIC," Hey, Jeremy. I, uh--can't find my ring. I took it off for the gym and thought I put it-- there it is."
3675,JEREMY, Losing family heirlooms-- bad.
3676,ALARIC, How's your extra credit coming? You pick a topic yet?
3677,JEREMY," Mystic Falls, the cil w*r era."
3678,ALARIC, What's the angle?
3679,JEREMY, My family-- I found a journal of an anstor who lived in the 1800s. And the Gilberts were one of the original founding families of Mystic Falls. So...
3680,ALARIC, That sounds good.
3681,STEFAN, Bonnie.
3682,BONNIE, Stefan
3683,STEFAN, Hey. 
3684,BONNIE, Hi.
3685,STEFAN, I haven't seen you lately. How are you doing with everything?
3686,BONNIE, I'm fine. It's all fine.
3687,STEFAN, Good. Yeah
3688,BONNIE, Are you back in school?
3689,STEFAN, No. Actually I came here to find you. I s hoping you could help me with something. A spell.
3690,BONNIE," Stefan, look, I know Elena's ok with all of this, and I appreciate what you did to help me. But I'm not really ready to dive into it with you just yet."
3691,STEFAN, I understand. But I need your help. It's Elena. She's with Damon. I have Elena's necklace. I was just hoping you could use this to make some sort of a connection. I just need to know that she's ok.
3692,BONNIE, How do you know I can do this?
3693,STEFAN, Because I've known a few witches over the years. I've seen what they can do.
3694,BONNIE, I'm still new at it.
3695,STEFAN, It's ok. Give it a sh*t.
3696,BONNIE, Ok. All right.
3697,BONNIE, There's nothing. Nothing's happening. Usually there's an image or... Tell me if anyone's looking.
3698,STEFAN, Ok.
3699,BONNIE, All right.
3700,STEFAN, What is it?
3701,BONNIE, Something's wrong. 
3702,STEFAN, With Elena?
3703,BONNIE," With me. There's something wrong with me. I have to go. I'm sorry, Stefan. I can't help you."
3704,ELENA," So, where's my car?"
3705,DAMON, I pulled it off on the side of the road. I don't think anyone will bother it.
3706,ELENA, At about that man in the road? Was he a...?
3707,DAMON, From what I could tell. Yeah.
3708,ELENA, You don't know him?
3709,DAMON," If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him. I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the vamp bar and grill."
3710,ELENA," You brought me to a bar? Damon, I'm not old enough. They're not going to let me in."
3711,DAMON, Sure they will.
3712,WOMAN," No. No, it can't be. Damon. My honey pie."
3713,WOMAN," Listen up everybody! Here's to the man that broke my heart, crushed my soul, destroyed my life, and ruined any and all chances of happiness! Drink up! Ahh. Whoo!"
3714,WOMAN," So, how'd he rope you in?"
3715,ELENA," I'm not roped in. Actually, I'm dating his--"
3716,WOMAN," Honey, if you're not roped, you're whipped. Either way, just enjoy the ride."
3717,ELENA," Ok. So, how did you two meet?"
3718,WOMAN, College.
3719,ELENA, You went to college?
3720,DAMON," I've been on a college campus, yes. "
3721,WOMAN," About 20 years ago, when I was just a sweet, young freshman I met this butiful man, and fell in love. And then he told me about his littleecret, made me love him more. Because, you see, I had a little secret of my own that I was dying to share with somebody."
3722,DAMON, She's a witch.
3723,WOMAN, Changed my world.
3724,DAMON, I rocked your world.
3725,WOMAN," He is good in the sack, isn't he? But mostly he's just a walkawayoe. So, what is it that you want?"
3726,GIRL," Oh my god. I am so sorry. There was this one book wedged between the other. And I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom. Are you ok?"
3727,JEREMY," Yeah, I'm fine."
3728,GIRL, Ohh! I'm Anna.
3729,JEREMY, I'm Jeremy.
3730,BONNIE, Thank god you're back.
3731,GRAMS," And hello to you, too. What's the matter?"
3732,BONNIE," Powers are gone, Grams. I can't do anything, even when I concentrate. And there's nothing in in any of these books that can tell me how to get them back."
3733,GRAMS," Hang on, now. Just calm down. Tell me what happened."
3734,BONNIE, I can't.
3735,GRAMS, We keeping secrets now?
3736,BONNIE, I have to. I'm sorry. I promised. Please help me.
3737,GRAMS," Well, first of all, there's nothing in any of these that's gonna help you. If you're blocked, it's in here. You gotta clear it out, then you're back in business."
3738,BONNIE, Clear what out?
3739,GRAMS, Whatever's got you so scared.
3740,ELENA," Hi, Jenna. I'm so sorry."
3741,JENNA, Where are you? Why didn't you call?
3742,ELENA," I was so tired last night. I fell asleep at Bonnie's. And then this morning, I just wanted to get to school."
3743,JENNA, Are you ok?
3744,ELENA," You know, Stefan and stuff."
3745,DAMON," Come on, there's gotta be another way. "
3746,WOMAN," After all these years, it's still only Katherine. How do you even know she's still alive?"
3747,DAMON," Well, you help me get into that tomb and we'll find out."
3748,WOMAN, I already did. 20 years ago. Remember? 3 easy steps-- Comet. Crystal. Spell.
3749,DAMON, There's a little problem with number 2. I don't have the crystal.
3750,WOMAN," That's it, damon. There is no other way. It's Emily's spell."
3751,DAMON, What about a new spell with a new crystal that overrides Emily's spell?
3752,WOMAN," It doesn't work that way, baby. Emily's spell is absolute. You can't get into that tomb."
3753,BONNIE, Hello? Anybody here?! Aah!
3754,STEFAN," Elena, is th you?"
3755,ELENA, I'm here.
3756,STEFAN, Where are you?
3757,ELENA, You lied.
3758,STEFAN," Not until I explain, please."
3759,ELENA," So, you didn't lie?"
3760,STEFAN, Just tell me where you are. So that I can comeet you.
3761,ELENA," How am I connected to Katherine, stefan?"
3762,STEFAN, I honestly don't know.
3763,ELENA, And I'm supposed to believe that?
3764,STEFAN, It's the truth. I-- Listen--
3765,DAMON, You ok?
3766,ELENA, Don't pretend to care. I know you're gloating inside.
3767,WOMAN," Hey, it's Bree. You'll never gonna guess who walked into my bar."
3768,BONNIE, Oww. Hello?! Anybody?! Ahh!
3769,STEFAN, Hi. 
3770,GRAMS, Can I help you?
3771,STEFAN, I'm Stefan. I'm a friend of Bonnie's. Her dad told me that she might be here.
3772,GRAMS, She was. Not anymore.
3773,STEFAN, Do you know where she went?
3774,GRAMS, No. But you do.
3775,STEFAN, I'm sorry?
3776,GRAMS," I told her to face down her fear. And I'm sensing now that you know exactly why she was scared. You know what I am. And yet you offered me your hand, which means you wanted me to see that I can trust you."
3777,STEFAN, Can you?
3778,GRAMS," I just you'll keep her safe. You'd better be on your way, then. I'm not going to invite you in. I'm sure you understand why."
3779,ANNA, This aisle is local and state history. And civil w*r is one over. What do you need?
3780,JEREMY, Local. 1860s. Do you work here?
3781,ANNA," Nope. You want reference. This way. Uh, home-schooled. I study here for a moc school environment. Ah, here we go. Original settlers, town archives, founders stuff. It's all here. So, what's your topic ?"
3782,JEREMY, The town's fear and hysteria surrounding the w*r and how it influenced certain writers of the time.
3783,ANNA, You might want to focus that.
3784,JEREMY, The origin of local folklore and myths.
3785,ANNA, You mean the vampires?
3786,ELENA, Let's just say that I'm descended from Katherine-- Does that make me part vampire?
3787,DAMON," Vampires can't procreate. But we love to try. No. If you are related, it would mean Katherine had a child before she was turned."
3788,ELENA, Did Stefan think that he could use me to replace her?
3789,DAMON," Kinda creepy if you ask me. Come on, what? You don't like pickl? What's wrong with you?"
3790,ELENA, How can you even eat? If technically you're supposed to be...
3791,DAMON," Dead. It's not such a bad word. As long as I keep a healthy diet of bl*od in my system, our body functions pretty normally."
3792,ELENA, This nice act. Is any of it real?
3793,BREE," Here you go, honey."
3794,DAMON, Thank you.
3795,ELENA, I'll have one too.
3796,DAMON, Hmm?
3797,ELENA," Time out, remember? For 5 minutes? Yeah, well that 5 minutes is going to need a beer."
3798,BREE, There you go.
3799,JEREMY," You're kidding me, right? There's no such thing as vampires."
3800,ANNA," Well, there's not a lot of documentation but the stories have been told since the civil w*r. My granddad used to tell me all these creepy stories when I was little. And he said that his granddad told them to him."
3801,JEREMY, Yeah. That would be folklore. Vampires are a metaphor for the demons of the day. 
3802,ANNA, Which are?
3803,JEREMY," The union soldiers. I've read the stories myself. They talk about the enemy, the demons that attack night. "
3804,ANNA, That sounds like vampires to me.
3805,JEREMY," Allegorical vampires. Which is what it is. Creative expression during a very volatile time. I mean, a couny at w*r doesn't want realism. They want fantasy. Thus, vampire fiction."
3806,ANNA," Man, you're smart. I gotta give it to you. When I first saw you, I missed it."
3807,JEREMY, Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately. But I'm just now getting back to my old self.
3808,ANNA," Well, good luck on the paper. I gotta get home. You know, my great grandfather actually showed me a journal once of an ancestor and he had written all of this creepy stuff about vampires. It was actually really believable."
3809,JEREMY, Wait. A journal?
3810,ANNA, Yeah? Why?
3811,JEREMY, Are you sure you have to go?
3812,BONNIE," Come on, phone! Great! Great."
3813,STEFAN, Bonnie! 
3814,BONNIE, Get away from me!
3815,STEFAN, It's me. It's stefan.
3816,BONNIE, Stefan. The ground gave way and I fell.
3817,STEFAN," It's ok. It's ok. Calm down. Come on, let's get you out of here."
3818,BONNIE, How?
3819,STEFAN, Just close your eyes. Trust . 
3820,STEFAN, You can open your eyes now.
3821,BONNIE, Whoa.
3822,STEFAN, I didn't want to scare you.
3823,BONNIE, How did you know where I was?
3824,STEFAN," Well, your grandmother told me what you were doing. I guessed the where."
3825,BONNIE, I heard them. Down there. Behind the door. Are they in pain?
3826,STEFAN, In the beginning--yes. But not anymore. They've been starved to the point of dessication.
3827,BONNIE, But if they have blood--
3828,STEFAN," That's not going to happen, Bonnie. They can't get out. Emily saw to that when she had you destroy the crystal. You're safe."
3829,DAMON, Ready...
3830,BREE, Go!
3831,ELENA, That's 3. Do you need a bib?
3832,DAMON, Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw like a snake to consume alcohol.
3833,ELENA," Whatever. All right. Who's next? Another round, Bree."
3834,GIRL," Honey, you should be on the floor."
3835,ELENA," I am not even drunk. My tolerance is, like, way up here."
3836,BREE, All right. Here you go.
3837,JEREMY," So, you have no idea where the journal is?"
3838,ANNA, Nope. Gramps died. And all the kids split his stuff. I can ask.
3839,JEREMY, I just find it weird that our ancestors kept the same kind of journal. It's crazy.
3840,ANNA, Maybe it's based in some partial reality.
3841,JEREMY, No. It's gotta be a metaphorical. My ancestor wrote short stories.
3842,ANNA," So, that's why you're hung up on the fiction of it all."
3843,JEREMY," No, I'm hung up on fiction of it all because I've seen ""the lost boys"" and ""near dark,"" like, 50 times."
3844,ANNA, Are those movies? Hey. I've never seen them. Maybe we can have a fright night and rent a whole bunch of vampire movies.
3845,JEREMY," Uh, yeah, sure."
3846,ANNA," Why does that sound like a no way in hell? Sorry, I'm blunt."
3847,JEREMY," No, it's--I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I just recently got out of something. It's a little too soon, you know?"
3848,ANNA," Oh please, sure. No worries. I meant as friends. Yeah. Look, I really gotta go. Nice meeting you, Jeremy."
3849,ELENA, Hello? 
3850,JENNA, Elena ?
3851,ELENA," Jenna? Hold on, it's loud in here."
3852,JENNA," Elena, where are you ? Are you ok ? "
3853,ELENA," Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good. Eveything's fine. Hold on. I can't hear you."
3854,ELENA, Hello ?
3855,BREE," Hey, where's your girl?"
3856,DAMON, Hmm.
3857,BREE, She was right back there.
3858,ELENA," Damon, no."
3859,DAMON, What the hell?!
3860,ELENA, No!
3861,DAMON, Who are you?
3862,MAN, That's perfect. You have no idea.
3863,ELENA, What are you talking about? What did he do?
3864,MAN," He k*ll my girlfriend. What did she do to you, huh? What did she do to you?! Nothing."
3865,ELENA, I don't understand.
3866,MAN," My girlfriend went to visit Stefan, and Damon k*ll her. Got it?"
3867,DAMON, Ugh!
3868,ELENA, Lexi? Lexi was your girlfriend? She told me about you. She said you were human.
3869,MAN, I was.
3870,ELENA, Lexi turned you?
3871,MAN," If you want to be with someone forever, you have to live forever."
3872,ELENA," She loved you. She said, ""when it's real, you can't walk away."" "
3873,MAN," Well, that's a choice you're not going to have to make. "
3874,ELENA," Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him--"
3875,MAN, I'm doing you a favor.
3876,ELENA, Lexi loved you. And she was good. That means you're good too. Be better than him. Don't do this. I'm begging you! Please.
3877,ELENA, Thank you.
3878,MAN, It wasn't for you.
3879,GRAMS," Well, now, look who's returned from battle. Can I talk to your friend for minute? BONNIE: Thank you. "
3880,GRAMS," I appreciate your help, Stefan."
3881,STEFAN," You're welcome, Sheila."
3882,GRAMS, I wasn't sure you remembered.
3883,STEFAN, October 1969. 
3884,GRAMS, I was barely a teenager.
3885,STEFAN, And you were leading what was probably the only anti-war sit-in within miles of Mystic Falls.
3886,GRAMS, Hmm. 
3887,STEFAN," You know when you spoke, people were mesmerized. I know I was."
3888,GRAMS," Until the cops showed up. You took a big risk coming to see me earlier. Letting me read you, realize who you were. It could have gone a completely different way."
3889,STEFAN, Your family has a very long history of keeping my secret. I knew that I could trust you if you believed I waworthy of your trust.
3890,GRAMS," Bonnie knows, doesn't she?"
3891,STEFAN, Yes.
3892,GRAMS," Please understand, our loyalty can only extend so far. This town won't be easy on any of us if they figure it out. And I'll protect my own before anybody else."
3893,STEFAN, I know that.
3894,GRAMS," As long as we're clear, goodnight, then."
3895,STEFAN," Goodnight, Sheila."
3896,DAMON," We were just leaving, and I wanted to sagood bye."
3897,BREE," Good to see you again, Damon. "
3898,DAMON, No kiss? 
3899,BREE, I'm full of vervain. I put it in everything I drink.
3900,DAMON, And you're telling me this why?
3901,BREE, Lexi was my friend. How could you? The tomb can be opened.
3902,DAMON, You're lying!
3903,BREE," Emily's grimoire, her spellbook. If you know how she closed the tomb the reversal process will be in her book. You can open that tomb."
3904,DAMON, Where is this book?
3905,BREE, I--I--
3906,DAMON, You have no idea.
3907,BREE, No. I'm telling you the truth.
3908,DAMON," And I believe you. My dear, sweet Bree. That's why I'm almost sorry."
3909,BREE, Ugh!
3910,ELENA," So, why did you bring me with you?"
3911,DAMON," Well you're not the worst company in the world, Elena. You could give yourself more credit."
3912,ELENA, Seriously?
3913,DAMON," You were there in the road. All damsel in distress-like. And I knew it would piss off Stefan. And... U're not the worst company in the world, Elena."
3914,ELENA, I used to be more fun.
3915,DAMON, You did ok.
3916,ELENA, I saved your life.
3917,DAMON, I know.
3918,ELENA, And don't you forget it.
3919,ELENA, Hi.
3920,STEFAN, Hi.
3921,ELENA, You could have told me.
3922,STEFAN, I wanted to tell you.
3923,ELENA," You said no more lies. Only the truth. I can handle the truth, Stefan. As crazy as it is, I can handle the fact that you are a vampire. And you have a vampire brother. And that my best friend is a witch. I can accept the fact that the world is much more mysterious place than I ever thought possible. But this--this lie, I can't take. What am I to you? Who am I to you?"
3924,STEFAN, You are not Katherine. You are the opposite everything that she was.
3925,ELENA, And when did you figure that out? Before you kissed me? Before we slept together?
3926,STEFAN, Before I met you.
3927,ELENA, What?
3928,STEFAN," The first day of school. We when met. It wasn't for the first time, Elena."
3929,ELENA, Then when was it?
3930,STEFAN," May 23, 2009."
3931,ELENA, But that was--
3932,STEFAN, That was the day your parents' car went off the bridge.
3933,ELENA, You were the?
3934,STEFAN," Every couple of years that I come back here to see Zach and see my home. Last spring, I was out in the woods, by old wickery bridge. And I heard the accident. All of it. I was fast getting there, but not fast enough. The car was already submerged. Your dad was still- he was still conscious. I was able to get to him, but he wouldn't let me help him, until I helped you."
3935,ELENA," Oh my god. When I woke up in the hospital, nobody could figure out how I got out of the car. They said it was a miracle. "
3936,STEFAN," I went back for them. But it was too late. I couldn't-- I couldn't save them. When I pulled you out, I looked at your face. You looked like Katherine. I couldn't believe the resemblance. After that, I spent months making sure th you weren't her. I watched you. I learned everythi that I could about you. And I saw that you were nothing like Katherine. And I wanted to leave town, but, Elena, I couldn't. I couldn't leave without knowing you. I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you. I wanted to. But you were so sad."
3937,ELENA, Why do I look like her?
3938,STEFAN," Elena, you've been through so much."
3939,ELENA," Why do I look like her, Stefan? What are you not telling me?"
3940,STEFAN," It didn't make any sense to me. You were a Gilbert. She was a Pierce. But the resemblance was too similar. And then I learned the truth. You were adopted, Elena."
3941,ANNA, There you are. 
3942,JEREMY, Hey. 
3943,ANNA," Hi. Ok, look. I know I don't know you, so don't ask me why I did this. I just, sometimes-- mostly all the time- I have this need to be right. So I googled and..."
3944,JEREMY, What is it?
3945,ANNA, Proof. Sort of.
3946,JEREMY, What does this mean?
3947,ANNA," Well, I only went as far back as 1942, and found that there's been a string of animal attacks periodically in and around this town for the past 75 years. It's consistent. In '62, 5 boes found. In '53, 4 people k*ll. In '74, 3 people dead. And there's been 5 this year. All attacked. All suffered major bl*od loss, as in drained of bl*od. "
3948,ELENA, How do you know that?
3949,STEFAN, Your birth certificate from the city records. It says Elena Gilbert. Mystic falls general. But there's no record of your mother ever being admitted.There's no record of her ever being pregnant.
3950,ELENA, What else do you know?
3951,STEFAN," For me to go any further, I would've had to look into the Pierce family, and I couldn't do that. It's too much of a risk. If someone found out I was asking about Katherine-- Listen to me, it doesn't matter. You are the woman that I love. I love you. "
3952,JENNA," I don't set a lot of rules, Elena. Not with you. I trust you to tell me the truth. Where were you? Why would you lie to me about it? I thought that we were closer than that. "
3953,ELENA, Now is not the time you want to talk to me about lies.
3954,JENNA, Don't do that. Don't turn this back on me. I didn't do anything.
3955,ELENA," Ok, question-- am I adopted? I trust you to tell me the truth too, Jenna. How could you not tell me? I thought we were closer than that."
3956,JENNA," Elena, didn't-- they asked me not to. "
3957,ELENA, I don't want to hear it!
3958,ALARIC'S GIRLFRIEND, I love you.
3959,ALARIC, I'm going to be late tonight.
3960,ELENA," Stefan, who was that man in the road?"
3961,STEFAN, I don't know. Do you remember anything else about him?
3962,ELENA, I wish. I never really saw his face. He was wearing a hoodie. All I can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me. 
3963,STEFAN," I brought some vervain for, um-- for you and jenna. And, um, I made this bracelet for Jeremy, few extra on for friends. You can put it in jewelry, or you can even put it in food or drink, but as long as it's in you or on you, a vampire cannot control you."
3964,ELENA, Wow. So much to remember.
3965,STEFAN," I know, but there's another vampire in town. So until we find out who it is and what he wants, we have to be careful."
3966,MAN, Hey. It's gonna be $22.
3967,JEREMY," Elena, I need the money! Uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table."
3968,ELENA," Hi. Um, keep the change."
3969,MAN, Thanks. And you have yourself a good night.
3970,Noises, books falling.
3971,STEFAN," What are you lookin' for, Damon?"
3972,DAMON, Not your concern.
3973,STEFAN," No, but putting Elena in harm's way, That is my concern. Heh heh."
3974,DAMON, What are you talking about?
3975,STEFAN, I'm talking about Atlanta.
3976,DAMON," Oh, yeah. Elena and I had blast."
3977,STEFAN," I get it. You're just bitter because one of us gets to be with the person that we love, and poor katherine is just out of reach. Unless there's another way for you to get into that tomb. Is that what Bree said?"
3978,DAMON, You're pathetic when you're fishing.
3979,STEFAN, You're transparent when you're deflecting.
3980,DAMON, Don't you have school?
3981,ALARIC," Surprised? It's a good essay. Your thoughts are clear, and your argument is well laid out. It's just, uh, you don't actually think there are vampires in mystic falls."
3982,JEREMY," No. I mean, I think statistically there's been more animal attacks, mystious deaths, uh, people gone missing, more than any other place in the whole commonwealth of Virginia. "
3983,ALARIC," It's conjecture, but creative, which is why you got the ""a."" I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up in the whole conspiracy theory of it all."
3984,JEREMY," Ah, I won't."
3985,ALARIC," All right. Oh, uh, Jeremy,the source that you cited for the 1860s info, uh, jonathan Gilbert..."
3986,JEREMY," Uh, my ancestor's journal?"
3987,ALARIC, I'd really like to see that sometime.
3988,JEREMY, Really?
3989,ALARIC," A first-person account of the civil w*r? That's like, uh, p*rn for a history teacher. JEREMY: You think my essay's creative, wait till you get a load of this thing."
3990,ALARIC, Thank you.
3991,CAROLINE, It's so pretty. 
3992,ELENA, Thank you. 
3993,CAROLINE," God, it'll go with, like, everything. What's the occasion?"
3994,ELENA, No occasion. Just a little friend gift.
3995,CAROLINE, Lesbian friend necklace? 'cause we're freaky like that?
3996,ELENA, Your friendship is important to me.
3997,CAROLINE, Why are you being so mushy?
3998,ELENA," Because you've been avoiding me, and I wanted you to know that whatever is going on with you and Matt, it's ok."
3999,CAROLINE," I was gonna talk to you about that. I was, but there's just not much to say. We've hung out a couple times. That's it, but... I just feel like we've peed as friends. This is weird. I shouldn't be talking to you about this. It's weird. It's weird, right?"
4000,ELENA," It's a little weird, but--heh. If it's what you and Matt want, then it's not about me."
4001,CAROLINE," But it's all about you. Matt's not over you, and we all know it."
4002,ELENA, I'm with Stefan now. Matt understands that. He knows he has to move on.
4003,BOYS, Matt Donovan. What do you know?
4004,MATT," Ben McKittrick. What's up, man?"
4005,BEN," Rough season, bud."
4006,MATT, Yeah. It's kind of hard to recover when you have to forfeit half your games.
4007,BEN, You gonna be workin' here?
4008,MATT," Yep, followin' in your footsteps, minus the late championship."
4009,BEN," Well, can't all be football gods."
4010,MATT, Yeah.
4011,BEN, So what's the plan? Cook line?
4012,MATT, Busboy.
4013,BONNIE, I can't believe you're adopted. 
4014,ELENA, I never saw that coming. And it gets weirder. I looked at my birth certificate. It lists Miranda and Grayson Gilbert as my birthparents. None oit makes any sense.
4015,BONNIE," Which is why you should ask Jenna. First of all, the Elena I know would always want the real truth, good or bad."
4016,ELENA, And second of all?
4017,BONNIE," You just found out your boyfriend is a vampire, so unless your birthparents are aliens... How bad could it be?"
4018,ELENA," Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store. My outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories."
4019,BONNIE," Ok, I'll pay the bill."
4020,ELENA, Ok. Bye.
4021,BONNIE, Bye.
4022,BONNIE, What do you want from me?
4023,DAMON, I think we need a fresh start.
4024,BONNIE, You tried to k*ll me.
4025,DAMON," But I didn't, and if I wanted to, I would have. Does that not count for anything?"
4026,BONNIE," You know, I can start fires with my mind. Fires k*ll vampires, right? Just stay the hell away from me."
4027,BEN, Everything ok over here?
4028,DAMON," Yeah, we're fine."
4029,BEN, I wasn't talkin' to you. 
4030,BONNIE, Thank you.
4031,BEN," Anytime, Bonnie."
4032,BONNIE, Wait. You remember me?
4033,BEN, I didn't graduate that long ago. You're makin' me feel old.
4034,BONNIE, Sorry. I didn't-- I didn't mean that. I just-- I didn't know you knew me.
4035,BEN, I always know a pretty face.
4036,ELENA, Hello.
4037,MAN," Hello, Elena."
4038,ELENA," Hey, who's this?"
4039,MAN, You hit me with your car. Is that a new one?
4040,ELENA, You got away from me. You won't next time.
4041,ELENA," Why me? What does he want with me, a-and if he's trying to k*ll me, then why call first?"
4042,STEFAN," That's because we're predators, Elena. We hunt. We stalk. It's often as exciting as the k*ll. I want you to take this. "
4043,ELENA, This is Jeremy's pocket watch. How did you get it?
4044,STEFAN," I took it from Damon, who took it from Logan, who must have taken it from you."
4045,ELENA, What happened to it?
4046,STEFAN," Well, it's n just a watch. It's a-- it's a sort of compass, But it points to vampires."
4047,ELENA, Why did my father have it?
4048,STEFAN," Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864, th were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires. The compass was used to find us."
4049,ELENA, Did you know them?
4050,STEFAN," Yes. I want you to keep this. That way, you'll know if you're ever in danger."
4051,MATT, I've nevereen you such a mess.
4052,CAROLINE, Don't talk smack.
4053,MATT," I mean, I just thought that you told everyone else what to do."
4054,CAROLINE," Well, I do that, too, but if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. You know, I just like that we're hanging out. Who knew--you and me?"
4055,MATT," Well, who knew you could be fun?"
4056,CAROLINE," So what are you wearing to this dumb dance, anyway? Should we color-coordinate?"
4057,MATT," Uh, I'm not goin'."
4058,CAROLINE, Why not?
4059,MATT," I gotta work, bussin' tables at the grill."
4060,CAROLINE, Since when are you a busboy?
4061,MATT," It's a job. You know, some of us have to work, Caroline. With our mom in and out, things are tight, so..."
4062,CAROLINE, I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that I didn't know you had a job.
4063,MATT," Well, I do. I gotta go."
4064,ANNA, Hey. How'd it go?
4065,JEREMY, What?
4066,ANNA, The paper.
4067,JEREMY," Oh. I got an ""a."" Thanks for the artles. They really helped."
4068,ANNA, Cool. So what'd he say about the vampir? Did he believe it?
4069,JEREMY," I don't even believe it. It's just a paper, Anna. Anyways, I, uh-- I gotta get goin'."
4070,ANNA," Uh, hey, um... D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?"
4071,JEREMY," Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch duty at the school dance."
4072,ANNA, Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?
4073,JEREMY," Well, I'm failin' english, so I copped a plea."
4074,ANNA," Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something. I'm being pushy again, aren't I? Heh."
4075,JEREMY," Well, thanks for the help. I'll-- I'll see you around."
4076,JENNA, Spoke to the insurance company. Car's totaled. You can keep using mine for now.
4077,ELENA, So you're coming to the dance?
4078,JENNA, Alaric asked me to help chaperone.
4079,ELENA," Why didn't you tell me, Jenna?"
4080,JENNA, Your mom was gonna do it eventually. I never thought I'd have to.
4081,ELENA," If my mom were here right now and I asked, she'd tell me the truth."
4082,JENNA," Your dad was about to leave the office one night when this girl showed up. She was 16, a runaway, and about to give birth. He delivered her baby, and he gave her a place to stay, but a few days later, she disappeared. And there you were. Your parents were trying so hard to have a baby. I-it just wasn't happening. All Miranda ever wanted was to be a mom."
4083,ELENA," Well, why were my parents' names on the birth certicate?"
4084,JENNA," Your dad was a doctor, Elena. He took care of it. They didn't wanna lose you, so they kept it quiet, told as fepeople as possible, But if anyone ever wanted proof, they had documtation."
4085,ELENA, What else do you know about her? The girl. Just her name. Isabelle.
4086,DAMON, You got the hair right. Why are you bringing me dad's journal ?
4087,DAMON, Why would I want it?
4088,STEFAN," Gee, I don't know, Damon. Maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding. Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it. I have. Nowhere in it does it say anything about Katherine or the tomb or how to open it."
4089,DAMON, I'm not surprised. Man could rely spell his own name.
4090,STEFAN," I'm really sorry that it won't be of any help with your diabolical plan, the sequel. You know, I could help you."
4091,DAMON," You, help me? Aw, I don't know. Seems a little unnatural."
4092,STEFAN," I'll do anythingo get you out of this town, even release Katherine."
4093,DAMON, What about the other 26 vampires?
4094,STEFAN," No, no, no. They can't come. They have to stay put, but Katherine,"
4095,DAMON, I would consider that. What are you doin'? Hmm? What's your angle?
4096,STEFAN, Think about it.
4097,DAMON, Why would I trust you?
4098,STEFAN," See that's your problem, Damon. You apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else. If history's any indication, there's only one liar among us."
4099,ELENA, Jenna? Jeremy?
4100,DAMON, Stefan's phone. How may I help you?
4101,ELENA, Where is he?
4102,DAMON," He's on his way to you, Forgot is phone."
4103,ELENA, Thank god. This compass was spinning. Stefan must be here. Thank you.
4104,DAMON, You're welcome.
4105,STEFAN, Are you ok? Are you ok?
4106,DAMON, How did he get in?
4107,ELENA, He was invited in.
4108,STEFAN, He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.
4109,DAMON," Well, he gets points fothat. Did he say what he wanted?"
4110,ELENA, No. He was too busy trying to k*ll me.
4111,STEFAN, And you have no idea who this is?
4112,DAMON, No. Don't look at me like that. I told you we had company.
4113,ELENA, You think there's more than one?
4114,DAMON, We don't know.
4115,STEFAN," Damon, he was invited in."
4116,DAMON, Then we go get him tonight.
4117,STEFAN, You up for it?
4118,ELENA, What do I have to do?
4119,DAMON, Let your boyfriend take you to the dance. Well see who shows up.
4120,STEFAN, That's a bad idea.
4121,DAMON," Till we get him, this house isn't safe. For anyone who lives in it. It's worth a sh*t."
4122,ELENA, I'll do it. I'll be with the two of you. I'll be safe.
4123,JENNA, Alaric.
4124,ALARIC," Hey, look at you."
4125,JENNA, I figured I'd stand out less if I dressed up.
4126,ALARIC, Heh heh. Liar.
4127,JENNA," Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance. I went to school here, you know. They do the sixts and seventies, too, fyi."
4128,ALARIC, Oh. Can't wait. Can I get you a drink? I hear the punch is real boss.
4129,ELENA, Having fun?
4130,CAROLINE," No, but this took about 2 hours, so I'm at least staying half of that."
4131,BONNIE, What's Damon doing here?
4132,ELENA, He wanted to come. I promise. He'll behave.
4133,CAROLINE," So what is this, like, a threesome now, you and the Salvatore brothers?"
4134,ELENA," No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan, then I have to learn to tolerate Damon. It's not like I can k*ll him."
4135,BONNIE, There's a thought.
4136,CAROLINE, Mmm. I'll help.
4137,JENNA, I'm really starting to see a change in Jeremy. Finally.
4138,ALARIC," Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly, the, uh--the trauma and the grief ther are some of the tougher things 'll face in life. "
4139,JENNA, From someone who knows. You have no idea what happened?
4140,ALARIC," That's the hard part, not knowing."
4141,JENNA, Is it ok to talk about your wife?
4142,ALARIC, Heh. There's not much to talk about.
4143,JENNA," That must be impossible to deal with, not having any answers."
4144,ALARIC," I'd be lying to you if I told you it didn't keep me up at night. Wondering why, by who."
4145,JENNA, Maybe one day.
4146,ALARIC, Hope so. Hope so.
4147,DAMON," Hi, Bonnie. Wanna dance?"
4148,BONNIE, I'm out of here.
4149,DAMON, Please give me another chance.
4150,CAROLINE," Back off, Damon."
4151,ELENA, Where did they go?
4152,DAMON, I don't know.
4153,STEFAN, What did you say to them?
4154,DAMON, I was perfectly polite. Elena... Would you like to dance?
4155,ELENA, I would love to. (To Stefan) May I have is dance?
4156,ELENA, Shouldn't you guys be able to sense each other or something?
4157,STEFAN, No. Doesn't work that way. See him anywhere?
4158,ELENA, Not unless he has a pompadour. 
4159,STEFAN, Heh. Wow. Was not one of the better fashion trends.
4160,ELENA, Come on. I'm sure you looked great back then. Are there pictures?
4161,STEFAN, No. b*rned. Buried.
4162,ELENA," Seriously, what was it like, the fifties? 'cause in my mind, I have this picture of somewhere between ""American bandstand,"" ""Grease."" It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes."
4163,STEFAN," Well, that and, you know, mccarthyism and segregation and nuclear arms race."
4164,ELENA," Ok, but there were poodle skirts."
4165,STEFAN, There were poodle skirts.
4166,ELENA, You're so teaching me how to do the hand jive.
4167,STEFAN, No. That's not gonna happen.
4168,ELENA, Ooh!
4169,ANNA, You neglected to mention this was a theme party.
4170,JEREMY, What are you doing here?
4171,ANNA," Well, seeing you also neglected to invite me, I took matters into my own hands."
4172,JEREMY, You're doin' that thing again.
4173,ANNA, What thing would that be?
4174,JEREMY," That thing where you pretend we're dating, Even though we're not."
4175,ANNA," Oh, you mean stalking. Yeah. Heh. Get over yourself. Come on. I've never been to a school dance before. Humor me."
4176,BONNIE, Let's sit up there.
4177,CAROLINE," Be a little more obvious, Bonnie."
4178,BONNIE, Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.
4179,CAROLINE, What? It's just a drizzle. Ben McKittrick? Really?
4180,BONNIE, He's hot.
4181,CAROLINE, He's a washed-up jock who pours drinks for a living. You could do way better. Hi.
4182,MATT, What's up?
4183,ALARIC," Yeah, I don't recognize you. How'd you get roped into chaperoning? Alaric Saltzman. I'm the new history teacher."
4184,DAMON," Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position."
4185,ALARIC, So I've been told.
4186,DAMON, Damon. Salvatore.
4187,ALARIC," Salvatore, as in, uh, Stefan?"
4188,DAMON," He's my little brother I'm his legal guardian, hence the chaperoning."
4189,ALARIC," I hear he's very bright, not that I've had a chance to see for myself."
4190,DAMON," Well, his attendance record's a little spotty. Family drama."
4191,ALARIC, Parents?
4192,DAMON," Mm, it's just the two of us now."
4193,ALARIC," You, uh--you live here your whole life?"
4194,DAMON, On and off. Travel a bit.
4195,ALARIC, Really? Where?
4196,DAMON," Around the States? Heh. I'm sorry. I'm nosy. I--I don't mn to pry. Look, it was nice meeting you."
4197,DAMON," You, too."
4198,ALARIC, Enjoy the rest of the dance.
4199,CAROLINE, Tonight was so much better on paper.
4200,BONNIE," Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself. Go and talk to him. Be bold and fearless."
4201,CAROLINE," Yeah, this coming from the girl who's been eye stalking the bartender."
4202,BONNIE, You're right.
4203,BONNIE, Hi.
4204,BEN, Twice in one day. Lucky me.
4205,BONNIE, I'm proving something to my friend.
4206,BEN," Oh, yeah? What's that?"
4207,BONNIE, That you don't have to sit around and wait for a guy to come up to you.
4208,BEN, Does that mean that you're asking me out on a date?
4209,BONNIE, Does that mean you want me to?
4210,BEN," Well, what did you have in mind?"
4211,BONNIE, Do you like karaoke?
4212,BEN, No. But I would really like to go on a date with you.
4213,CAROLINE, Seriously?
4214,MATT, Is that for me?
4215,CAROLINE, Do you see anyone else in the vicinity?
4216,MATT, Do you need something?
4217,CAROLINE, Are you mad at me or something?
4218,MATT," No, care. I'm not mad. I--"
4219,CAROLINE," Well, then why are you being so weird?"
4220,MATT, I'm not. I'm working.
4221,CAROLINE, You're avoiding.
4222,MATT," No. I have a table to clean. You know, that's the kind of thing that washed-up jocks do to make a living."
4223,JEREMY," You don't go to school here. You know, you don't have to help."
4224,ANNA," Oh, I don't mind. It's fun. Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget, can I borrow your anctor's journal?"
4225,JEREMY, Why?
4226,ANNA, You said I could read it.
4227,JEREMY," Uh, I don't have it."
4228,ANNA," Oh. Well, obviously you didn't bring it here, Uh, but I can walk you home."
4229,JEREMY," No. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher."
4230,ANNA, Wait. Why did you give it to him?
4231,JEREMY, Because he wanted to read it. 
4232,ANNA," You know, you shouldn't be giving that to just anybody."
4233,JEREMY, But I should give it to you?
4234,ANNA, Loan. Loan it to me.
4235,JEREMY," Well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman."
4236,ANNA, Maybe he's in his classroom. We can get it back.
4237,JEREMY, What's the big deal with the stupid journal? Your eye.
4238,ANNA," Um, there's something in it. Forget it. I gotta go."
4239,ELENA, Maybe he's not gonna show.
4240,STEFAN, You mean we did all this dancing for nothing?
4241,ELENA, Ahh. The horror.
4242,STEFAN, I'm really sorry for all this.
4243,ELENA," It's my choice. I decided to be here. I officially signed up for it, wo I don't wanna hear you apologizing anymore. Show me how it's done in the fifties."
4244,STEFAN," Uh, no."
4245,ELENA, Come on. One move?
4246,STEFAN," Now you remember that, because it's never gonna happen again."
4247,MAN, What a you doing here?
4248,ANNA," Trying to get the journal, as in sticking to the plan, something you're not doing. Leave the girl alone."
4249,MAN, I like her. She looks like Katherine.
4250,ANNA," She's not Katherine. Ok, Katherine is in the tomb."
4251,MAN," I know, but until we open that tomb, I got her to play with."
4252,ANNA, Dot be stupid. That girl is with the Salvatore brothers.
4253,MAN, They don't scare me. They never have.
4254,ANNA," Please, no. Don't do this. You're gonna ruin everything."
4255,MAN, You got noth' to worry about.I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. You will get what you came for. Just let me have my fun. She looks like Katherine.
4256,ELENA," You really can't take him anywhere, can you?"
4257,STEFAN," Uh, no."
4258,ELENA," Stefan, the back corner."
4259,STEFAN, Get Damon.
4260,BOY, What did I do?
4261,STEFAN, Where is he?
4262,BOY," I was getting a soda, and then this guy gave me his hoodie."
4263,MAN," Hello, elena. Here's what you're going to do. There's an exit door behind you. You have 5 seconds. "
4264,ELENA, No. 
4265,MAN, Or your brother dies. I can snap his neck so fast I bet there's not even a witness. Start walking.
4266,MAN, Don't you dare touch him. Keep walking. Through the door.
4267,ELENA, Ahh!
4268,DAMON," Hey, dickhead. Nobody wants to k*ll you. Just wanna talk. "
4269,STEFAN, Now you feel like talkin'?
4270,MAN, Screw you.
4271,STEFAN, Wrong answer. Why are you doing this?
4272,MAN, Cause it's fun.
4273,STEFAN, What do you want with Elena?
4274,MAN, She looks like Katherine.
4275,DAMON, You knew Katherine?
4276,MAN, Oh. You thought you were the only ones. You don't even remember me.
4277,DAMON, Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?
4278,MAN, No.
4279,MAN, The grimoire. 
4280,DAMON, Where is it?
4281,MAN, Check the journal. The journal. Jonathan gilbert's.
4282,STEFAN, Who else is working with you?
4283,DAMON, Who else is the?
4284,MAN, No. You're gonna have to k*ll me.
4285,ELENA, What do we--how are you gonna find the others now?
4286,DAMON, He had to die.
4287,ELENA, But...
4288,STEFAN," Elena, he's been invited in."
4289,STEFAN, Go. I got this.
4290,ALARIC, Hey.
4291,DAMON, What were you doing?
4292,ALARIC, Looking for Ms. Hilden.
4293,DAMON, Why are you in Mystic Falls?
4294,AMARIC, I got a job as a teacher.
4295,DAMON, Do you know what I am?
4296,ALARIC, You're my student's brother.
4297,DAMON, Is everything you're telling me the truth?
4298,ALARIC, Yes.
4299,DAMON, Then forget we had this conversation.
4300,DAMON, There's no way that idiot was workin' alone.
4301,STEFAN," You are. So the grimoire... That was Emily's, right? That's what you need to reverse the spell. When the founding families b*rned her, they took her things, and you were hoping that dad's journal would tell you where it is."
4302,DAMON," Look at you puttin' the pieces together. Good for you. I was half-right. Well, it's out there now. Let the games begin."
4303,STEFAN, My offer still stands. 
4304,DAMON," Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no doubt."
4305,STEFAN," No. Nothing hidden about it. No lies. No deception. I'm there when you open up that tomb, you and Katherine go, And the other 26 vampires die."
4306,DAMON, If I agree?
4307,STEFAN, I'll help you.
4308,DAMON, Why should I trust you?
4309,STEFAN, Because I'm your brother.
4310,DAMON," No, that's not gonna cut it."
4311,STEFAN, Because I want you gone.
4312,DAMON, Ok.
4313,CAROLINE," Look I said something stupid. I'm sorry, but I wasn't even taing about you."
4314,MATT," Yes, you were, Caroline. Ben could easily be me. We're just alike."
4315,CAROLINE," That's not true. Are you seriouy mad about this? Matt, you know me. Ok, I say stupid things without thinking, and then I have to apologize and take it back, and... I'm a terrible, awful person, but I'm rking on it."
4316,MATT," Look, can we just not do this right now?"
4317,CAROLINE, Ok. When do you get off?
4318,MATT," Look, this thing we've got, it's nice, and it feels really good, and I know you want take the next step."
4319,CAROLINE, How do you know that? Have you even asked me?
4320,MATT," I'm--I'm not over elena. I mean, I don't know if I am, but if we go there, then it could mess things up, and we might lose this, and this is the only good this I've got going for me right now. So if it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you and hurt you, and I don't wanna do that."
4321,CAROLINE," Well, big problem, Matt, because you took the next step all by yourself, and you played the whole thing out in your head, and you decided to bail before even giving it a sh*t. So this really great thing that we have, don't worry about losing it, 'cause it's already gone."
4322,JENNA, Thank you. I needed that.
4323,ALARIC," Well, thank you for--for coming. I--I really appreciate it. You made the evening much more... Well, you made it, period."
4324,JENNA, I'm glad I could help. 
4325,ALARIC, And thank you for puttinup with all that wife talk. I--I gotta stop doin' that. It doesn't bode well for dating.
4326,JENNA," Is that what this was, a date?"
4327,ALARIC," No, definitely not a date."
4328,JENNA, Oh.
4329,ALARIC," But Friday... You, me, and dinner and a movie, that could be a date. How about it?"
4330,JENNA," Works for me. Heh. Uh, you can talk about your wife all you want. It's gonna take time to heal. We should just be ourselves."
4331,ALARIC," Still, I think I'll keep the Isabelle talk to a minimum."
4332,JENNA, Isabelle?
4333,ALARIC, Yeah. That was her name.
4334,JENNA, Where was Isabelle from?
4335,ALARIC," From Virginia. I mean, not too- -not too far from here, actually."
4336,MATT," Caroline! Care, get in the truck."
4337,CAROLINE, What?
4338,MATT, This'll never work.
4339,STEFAN, Doing ok?
4340,ELENA, Is it weird if I say yes?
4341,STEFAN, Is it true?
4342,ELENA," I should feel more upset or scared or something, but I... Feel kind of exhilarated."
4343,STEFAN, It's the adrenaline. You'll crash soon enough.
4344,ELENA," Yeah, I guess. I fought back tonight. It felt good."
4345,STEFAN, I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
4346,ELENA, Still...
4347,STEFAN," I need to tell you something, And I don't know how you're gonna feel about it."
4348,ELENA, What?
4349,STEFAN, I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb to get Katherine back. But it was a lie. I let him believe that he could trust me.
4350,ELENA," Well, then why would you be worried about telling me?"
4351,STEFAN," Because he can be very persuasive, and you two have bonded lately."
4352,ELENA, That doesn't mean I trust him. It's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everytng he's done.
4353,STEFAN," I don't wanna be his enemy, Rlena, but I can't let him do it."
4354,ELENA," Then don't, and I'll help you, whatever it takes. Ok?"
4355,STEFAN, Ok. Come here.
4356,BEN, Don't sneak up on me.
4357,ANNA, You love it.
4358,BEN, Where's Noah?
4359,ANNA," His obsession got the best of him, and so did the salvatore brothers."
4360,BEN, They k*ll him?
4361,ANNA, Tortured and staked.
4362,BEN, You're not very upset.
4363,ANNA," I warned him, Ben, and he was just gonna screw everythingp anyway. Let's be honest. He wasn't exactlan asset. How do you do?"
4364,BEN," Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me. Did you get the journal?"
4365,ANNA," No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it."
4366,Katherine,"Please!Please, help us![Cart stops]Otis, my husband,"
4367,Man,What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?It's not safe.
4368,Katherine,"No. No, sir. It's not safe."
4369,Katherine,And that's how it's done.
4370,Damon,What happens to the bodies?
4371,Katherine,"Well, I'll take them into the woods And the other animals will finish them off. Are you sure you're ready for this?"
4372,Damon,I'm ready. I want you to turn me.
4373,Katherine,When it's time. Kiss me. You should get a taste.
4374,Damon,Sorry.
4375,Katherine,Don't be. Soon you won't be able to get enough.
4376,Elena, Good morning.
4377,Stefan,I could get used to this.
4378,Damon,"Rise and shine,sleepyheads."
4379,Elena,Damon! Please!
4380,Stefan,What are you doing?
4381,Damon,"Oh, stop being smutty."
4382,Stefan,"Seriously,get out of here!"
4383,Damon,"If I see something I haven't seen before,I'll throw a dollar at it."
4384,Elena,And it has to be right now?
4385,Damon,"Well, we have lots to do,now that we're all friends And working toward"
4386,Elena,Since when am I helping?
4387,Damon,"Well, Stefan's helping,and you've taken up residence In Stefan's bed, ergo..."
4388,Stefan,You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
4389,Elena,I'll look for it tonight. Good.
4390,Stefan,How do we know that this journal Will hold the location of the grimoire?
4391,Damon,In lieu of any other options.
4392,Elena,"OK, what exactly is a grimoire, anyway?"
4393,Damon,It's a witch's cookbook.
4394,Stefan,"Every spell that a witch casts Is unique unto itself,So every witch would document their work."
4395,Damon,Yeah. Cookbook.
4396,Stefan,"What about our mystery vampire?Dimwit obviously wasn't working alone,"
4397,Damon,"And I don't like that disadvantage, so...Chop, chop. You know, I really like this"
4398,Elena,"He does have-Oh, right, yeah."
4399,Stefan,OK.
4400,Elena,"Oh! No, come here."
4401,Stefan,We shouldn't-
4402,Elena,shh.
4403,Katherine,What are you doing?Stop it!
4404,Damon,Make me.
4405,Katherine,Yes?
4406,Emily,"Excuse me, miss katherine. Miss pearl is here to see you."
4407,Damon,"Hmm, no."
4408,Katherine,"It's good to see you, pearl."
4409,Pearl,Perhaps we could talk outside.
4410,Katherine,"Emily, would you please tell Mr. Salvatore That I've stepped away?"
4411,Emily,Which one?
4412,Katherine,Both.
4413,Pearl,"How long do you plan on staying with the salvatores?People talk,Katherine."
4414,Katherine,"The Salvatore have been kind to take me in. As far as everyone here knows,"
4415,Pearl,"A match you lit,no doubt. Honey, please be careful. Honorary fell came by"
4416,Katherine,I don't follow.
4417,Pearl,Try it.
4418,Katherine,What in hell?
4419,Pearl,Verlaine.
4420,Katherine,Why is there...they know.
4421,Pearl,"They're trying to find us, and they're getting crafty about it."
4422,Katherine,"The townspeople ingesting vervain, that's inconvenient."
4423,Pearl,It might be time for us to move on again.
4424,Katherine,No. I like it here. I'm not interested in leaving just yet.
4425,Anna,"Can we go, mama?Is something wrong?"
4426,Anna,"Hey, it's me again.Anna.Soccer chick And Foosball champion. I'll be at the grill"
4427,Ben,Who are you calling?
4428,Anna,Jeremy Gilbert.
4429,Ben,"You're not, like,into him, are you?"
4430,Anna,I need him for something. Get over it.
4431,Ben,Oh! Hmm!Damn it!
4432,Anna,"Dude, you gotta stop doing that."
4433,Ben,I know. I just-I keep forgetting.
4434,Anna,You're new. You'll get it.
4435,Ben,You found the Gilbert journal?
4436,Anna,Does that look like the Gilbert journal?
4437,Ben,"Well, it's old and musty,And how am I supposed to know the difference?"
4438,Anna,"I don't know, I figured maybe, just maybe,You've been paying a little bit of attention since we met."
4439,Ben," you know, you don't have to talk down to me. I'm not stupid."
4440,Anna,Here.Drink.I don't want you getting itchy around the witch. She can sense
4441,Ben,When can we go hunting again?This tastes old. I want fresh bl*od.
4442,Anna,"When we get that tomb open,You can k*ll anyone you want. For now,"
4443,Ben,Why did you choose me?
4444,Anna,I needed someone in a position to be my eyes and ears. Small town bartender
4445,Ben,There are plenty of bartenders choose from. Why me?
4446,Anna,You were sad Ben. You lacked purpose. You needed me.
4447,Elena ,Do you think Damon really believes us?That we're both trying to help him?
4448,Stefan,I don't think Damon don't knows what to believe. Trust isn't something
4449,Elena,"You know...I really think that Damon believes That everything he's done,"
4450,Stefan,There are other ways to get what you want. You don't have to k*ll people.
4451,Elena,So what do you think will happen If the tomb gets opened and Damon gets Katherine back?
4452,Stefan,"I think that no matter what Damon promises,A lot of people will die. That's Jonathan Gilbert."
4453,Elena,What's this?
4454,Jeremy,What are you guys doing?
4455,Elena,"Hey. Just going through some stuff,Feeling sentimental. Dad had this whole family journal from years ago. I thought I'd dig it up."
4456,Jeremy,Jonathan Gilbert's journal?
4457,Elena,"Yeah, what do you know about it?"
4458,Jeremy,I just did a history report on it.
4459,Elena,Oh. So where is it now?
4460,Jeremy,I gave it to Mr. Saltzman. He wanted to see it.
4461,Voice,I met Barnett and Giuseppe this evening. I saw the skepticism in their eyes
4462,Giuseppe Salvatore ,We're supposed to believe that can track one of them?
4463,Barnett Lockwood,"What is it, magic?"
4464,Jonathan Gilbert ,It's science.
4465,Barnett,I'll believe it when I see it.
4466,Giuseppe,I've been thinking about this church idea. I believe it could work.
4467,Stefan,"Excuse me, father. I didn't know you had guests."
4468,Giuseppe,"We'll be done in a few minutes, son."
4469,Stefan,"I'll come back. Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert,Mr. Lockwood."
4470,Jonathan,Have you told them?
4471,Giuseppe,Not yet.
4472,Jonathan,"Giuseppe, we need all the men we can get."
4473,Giuseppe,I'll tell them. You can count on both my boys.
4474,Saltzman,Hello?Hello?Someone there?
4475,Stefan,"You shouldn't have done that. Have a seat. What is this, compressed air?Did you make it yourself?Who are you?I'm not going to hurt you...Unless you try that again. Now...Who are you?"
4476,Saltzman,I'm a teacher.
4477,Stefan,Are we going to have to do this the hard way?
4478,Saltzman,"I'm also a historian. And while researching Virginia, I-Made a few discoveries about your town."
4479,Stefan,So you show up like van helsing. Come on. Tell me the truth.
4480,Saltzman,My wife was a parapsychologist. She spent her life researching
4481,Stefan,Where's your wife?
4482,Saltzman,Dead. A vampire k*ll her.
4483,Stefan,Where's the Gilbert journal?
4484,Saltzman,What do you want with it?
4485,Stefan,Where is it?
4486,Saltzman,It's on my desk.
4487,Stefan,"No, it's not."
4488,Saltzman,It was on my desk.
4489,Ben,Anything?
4490,Anna,"Not yet. Just a lot of gibberish. Yeah, some people just shouldn't journal."
4491,Ben,I thought this Gilbert was the brains.
4492,Anna,Don't you have a date?
4493,Ben,Yep. Wish me luck.
4494,Voice,"I saw her again today-The most beautiful woman in town,With a name just"
4495,Pearl,Have you thought any more of what I've said?
4496,Katherine,"We'll leave soon, pearl, I promise. I need to take care of a few things first."
4497,Pearl,"You're going to turn both of them, aren't you?[ Katherine nod]Katherine, please. Be Careful."
4498,Katherine,"We'll all be safe,I promise. Mr. Gilbert's coming. Quick, your cheeks. Perfectly Rosie."
4499,Jonathan,Miss pearl. May I have a moment?
4500,Pearl,Yes Mr. Gilbert. I'm still waiting for you To explain that comet in the sky.
4501,Katherine,Your mother has an admirer.
4502,Giuseppe,"As descendants of the founding families,They'll want to know that"
4503,Stefan,Of course they can. Is there any doubt?
4504,Giuseppe,I'm not sure your brother Damon Understands the importance of duty.
4505,Stefan,Damon left the confederacy on principle. It was his choice And should be
4506,Giuseppe,You'll forgive me if I have trouble respecting a deserter.
4507,Damon,"Well, I never asked for your respect."
4508,Giuseppe,"Good for you, Damon. Because all I have is disappointment."
4509,Stefan,You said the town is in trouble?
4510,Giuseppe,There's been too many deaths. It is time for us to fight back And stop these k*ll.
4511,Stefan,k*ll? What are you talking about?
4512,Giuseppe,We live amongst demons.
4513,Damon,"You're being cryptic now, father. Why don't you just say the word?"
4514,Giuseppe,Vampires. They exist. And they live amongst us. But we have a plan to k*ll them. And you're going to help us.
4515,Damon,"My father never approved of anyone I dated,Which only made me"
4516,Jenna,There were a few guys. Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.
4517,Damon,They ever find him?Or is he still missing?
4518,Jenna,"He's not missing. He's in the Bahamas working on his tan. Very entitled,"
4519,Damon,"Hello, Elena."
4520,Jenna,Hey. Where have you been?We're cooking dinner.
4521,Damon,Is Stefan with you?
4522,Elena,He'll be here soon.
4523,Stefan,How long have you been aware of me?
4524,Saltzman,I learned just recently. What about your brother?
4525,Stefan,You met Damon.
4526,Saltzman,Who do you think k*ll my wife?
4527,Stefan,Are you certain it was damon?
4528,Saltzman,I witnessed it.
4529,Stefan,"If you're here for revenge,This is going to end very badly for you."
4530,Saltzman,I just want to find out what happened to my wife.
4531,Stefan,I thought you just said that Damon...
4532,Saltzman,Yeah. I saw him Draining the life out of her. He must have heard me
4533,Stefan,Damon can never know why you're here. He'll k*ll you without blinking.
4534,Saltzman,I can take care of myself.
4535,Stefan,"No,you can't. I can help you. If you let me."
4536,Damon,Whoa. Hmm.
4537,Elena,Don't do that.
4538,Damon,Do what?
4539,Elena,You know what. That move was deliberate.
4540,Damon,"Well, yeah, I was deliberately trying To get to the nonspeaking of Stefan,Where is he?He's missing family night,Which I am enjoying immensely. Is it real?"
4541,Elena,Is what real?
4542,Damon,This renewed sense of brotherhood. Can I trust him?
4543,Elena,"Yes, you can trust him."
4544,Damon,Can I trust him?
4545,Elena,"I'm wearing vervain, Damon. It's not going to work."
4546,Damon,I'm not compelling you. I just want you to answer me. Honestly.
4547,Elena,Of course you can.
4548,Katherine," You can trust me, Mr. Salvatore. I would never cheat."
4549,Giuseppe,I'm losing or here. Again!
4550,Damon,She's good. I almost believe she genuinely likes him.
4551,Stefan,Perhaps she does.
4552,Damon,She knows father would have her k*ll if he knew the truth.
4553,Stefan,Not if we talk to him;Explained how we feel. He could help us keep her safe.
4554,Damon,"Have you gone mad?No, no, father would drive the stake in her himself!"
4555,Stefan,That's not true. We can trust him.
4556,Damon,"No, no, not with this. Please,promise me you won't tell him, Stefan."
4557,Stefan,I promise.
4558,Damon, There was a time when I trusted him more than anyone.
4559,Elena,Trust breeds trust. You have to give it get it.
4560,Damon,Are you lecturing me?
4561,Elena,Do you need to be lectured?
4562,Damon,I just want her back. I'm sure you can understand that.
4563,Elena,"I can understand that you would do anything for her, yes."
4564,Damon,Then you understand what I will do If anyone gets in my way.
4565,Jeremy,You said you never played this thing before.
4566,Damon,I'm a fast learner. Quick reflexes.[Jeremy's phone rings]Who are you dodging?
4567,Jeremy,"This girl Anna. She can be, uh, persistent."
4568,Damon,Is she hot?
4569,Jeremy,"Yeah yeah,but she can be weird."
4570,Damon,"Hot trumps weird,trust me."
4571,Jenna,He is ridiculously hot!
4572,Elena,Shh!He's an ass.
4573,Jenna,What are you doing with all this stuff?
4574,Elena,I thought there might be something About my birth parents.
4575,Jenna,Have you told Jeremy?
4576,Elena,I will. When the time is right.[Doorbell rings]That's Stefan.
4577,Jeremy,Dude!
4578,Damon,Well?
4579,Ben,Admit it. I can't sing.
4580,Bonnie,No. You were great.
4581,Ben,"Come on, totally trashed a Metallica song."
4582,Bonnie,"Well, first mistake,Metallica karaoke?"
4583,Ben,"Well, at least I could admit it."
4584,Bonnie,The woman with the tattoos loved you.
4585,Ben,"Yeah, well, next time,I'm going to throw out my pearl jam."
4586,Bonnie,Next time?
4587,Ben,"Yeah. So, uh,What are your friends up to tonight?"
4588,Bonnie,"They're all doing their own thing. Caroline's at her dad's, Elena's with her boyfriend."
4589,Ben,"Elena Gilbert, right?"
4590,Bonnie,Yeah.
4591,Ben,"Yeah, I remember. You guys used to hang out."
4592,Bonnie,She's my best friend.
4593,Ben,"Yeah, my friends, they all moved away after graduation,And I didn't. So we just kind of drifted apart."
4594,Bonnie,Oh. Elena and I are bonded for life. I can't imagine it either way.
4595,Ben,"That tight, huh?"
4596,Bonnie,"She's my sister. I mean, I'd die for her."
4597,Damon,Who took it?
4598,Stefan,I don't know.
4599,Damon,"You know what,it's that teacher. There's something really off about him."
4600,Stefan,"No, he doesn't know anything."
4601,Damon,Somebody got to him caught before me. Who else knew it was there?
4602,Elena,"No. Damon,leave him out of it!"
4603,Damon,"Why, what's the big deal?"
4604,Elena,Damon!
4605,Damon,So...I heard you found a really cool journal From back in the day. Who else did you show it to?
4606,Jeremy,Huh?
4607,Damon,"Don't ask questions,just spill."
4608,Jeremy,"You're kidding me, right?"
4609,Elena,Jer did you tell anyone other than Mr saltzman About Gilbert's
4610,Jeremy,Why is everybody so obsessed with that thing?
4611,Elena,Who else did you tell?
4612,Jeremy,Just that girl anna.
4613,Damon,The hot weird one?

4620,Bonnie,It's going great. He's a perfect gentleman.
4621,Elena,"Gentleman, huh?"
4622,Bonnie,"I know!Boring, huh? I just want to grab him and lay one on him."
4623,Elena,Why don't you?
4624,Bonnie,'cause I'm a chicken.
4625,Elena,"you're a powerful witch goddess. Come on, seize the day,broom Hilda."
4626,Bonnie,Okay. I'm going to text you later with more details.
4627,Elena,You better.
4628,Elena,Where's Damon?
4629,Stefan,"He left to track down Jeremy's friend Anna,See if there was"
4630,Elena,"Aren't you going to go with him?If he gets to the journal before we do, then..."
4631,Stefan,Doesn't matter.
4632,Elena,What is that?
4633,Stefan,It's a copy of it.
4634,Elena,How did you get it?
4635,Stefan,"Well, Mr. Saltzman may have a copy And was kind enough to loan it to me."
4636,Elena,He did?
4637,Stefan,"Not exactly, but I got it."
4638,Anna,"You just couldn't live without me, huh?"
4639,Jeremy,"Well, I kinda miss my daily dose of cute stalker chick."
4640,Anna,"Oh, funny."
4641,Jeremy,Let's play.
4642,Pearl,The sheriff was her earlier. He bought large volumes of the Vervain elixir.
4643,Katherine,Did he try to put his hands on you again?
4644,Pearl,Doesn't he always?
4645,Katherine,She's saving hearth For Jonathan Gilbert
4646,Pearl,I'm beyond saving. We know that.
4647,Damon,How can you be so calm?They're getting closer to you every day.
4648,Katherine,"We are the respectable ladies of mystic falls. Thanks to Emily, we walk"
4649,Pearl,Not unless a human tells them.
4650,Damon,I'd sooner die.
4651,Katherine,"And soon enough, you will."
4652,Anna,Mrs. Fell is approaching.
4653,Pearl,"Thank you,Annabelle."
4654,Elena,"Here's a reference that,he wrote about Emily.""the fell family"
4655,Stefan,"Yeah.""it was Giuseppe Salvatore who removed my fear.he told me he would protect the secret of the spell book. He said he would carry it to his grave."""
4656,Giuseppe,Stefan. To what do I owe this pleasure?
4657,Stefan,Did I interrupt your writing?
4658,Giuseppe,These are the dull musings of my troubled mind.
4659,Stefan,A great mind.
4660,Giuseppe,Still. I will carry the real secrets with me-
4661,Stefan,To your grave.
4662,Giuseppe,"And a full grave it will be. Now, speaking of troubled minds,What's on yours?"
4663,Stefan,I have concerns about your plan for the vampires.
4664,Giuseppe,And why is that?
4665,Stefan,We are making the presumption that all vampires Are as evil as they've
4666,Giuseppe,Do you have any evidence to the contrary?Do you know of any vampires?
4667,Stefan,"No. No, of course not. But are we to take what others say At face value?You always taught us so differently."
4668,Giuseppe,"Stefan...These creatures Are of the dark parts of hell. They have the ability to control your mind,Seduce your spirit. They are deadly. They must be destroyed. Those who stand with them;Those who bring shame to their families will be destroyed as well."
4669,Stefan,I know where it is.
4670,Damon,"OK, I give.[He cough]Damn. You're strong for a little thin"
4671,Anna,I was wondering how long it would take you to find me.
4672,Elena, Why isn't your father buried in your family's tomb?
4673,Stefan,It wasn't built until well after he died.
4674,Elena,Are you sure the grimoire's in there with him?
4675,Stefan,As sure as I could be.
4676,Elena,Great.
4677,Stefan,Elena. I can do this on my own.
4678,Elena,And I said I would do whatever I can to help.
4679,Stefan,"I know, and I appreciate that, but-"
4680,Elena,"This town is my home, Stefan. My friends and family are here. You're here. I don't want that tomb opened any more than you do.[Stefan exhales]I'm sorry that you have to do this."
4681,Stefan,What is that?
4682,Katherine,Gift.
4683,Stefan,From Damon?
4684,Katherine,"From Emily, actually. And when will you stop worrying about Damon?"
4685,Stefan,I want you all to myself.
4686,Katherine,"Just as he wants me,But I'm the one who gets to make all the rules."
4687,Stefan,And why is that?
4688,Katherine,Because I'm spoiled.
4689,Stefan,"Yes, you are."
4690,Katherine,And selfish. And because I can do this. And this. And this.
4691,Stefan,What?what?
4692,Katherine,Vervain.
4693,Stefan,What?Katherine!Katherine!
4694,Giuseppe,Go get the sheriff. Tell him we have a vampire.
4695,Stefan,What? No!
4696,Giuseppe,"Do as I say, son!Nothing that you feel for her is real. She's a vampire, Stefan!"
4697,Stefan,How did you know?
4698,Giuseppe,"Your sympathy for their plight. I didn't raise my sons to be so weak. The sheriff, now. Go, quickly!Now, son!"
4699,Damon,How long have you been here?
4700,Anna,"I arrived around half-past comet,Watching you screw up every chance you had to open that tomb."
4701,Damon,How did you know about the spell?
4702,Anna,"I didn't say much back then,Which means I heard everything."
4703,Damon,"So if you've been here the whole time,Then why are we just crossing paths right now?"
4704,Anna,I like to use others to do my dirty work.
4705,Damon,"Like Logan fell?Oh, yeah, thanks for that, by the way. Little bastard sh*t me."
4706,Anna,Logan was an idiot. We slipped him some bl*od when he started getting All poser slayer with that compass. I needed his family's journal. I couldn't let him die.
4707,Damon,What's you want with the fell journal?
4708,Anna,"I thought it contained the location Of the witch's spell book. I was wrong. According to her journal, honorea gave the grimoire To Jonathan Gilbert. And, according to this...He gave it to your father. So now you're going"
4709,Damon,Why would I help you?
4710,Anna,'cause you and I both want that tomb open.
4711,Damon,Sorry. I work alone.
4712,Ben,Well the check's paid. I'm all yours tonight. What do you want to do?
4713,Bonnie,This.[She kissed him]
4714,Ben,What's wrong?
4715,Bonnie,Nothing. Sorry. I just should have waited until the end of the night to do that.
4716,Ben,I didn't mind.
4717,Bonnie,"you know,I'm starting to get tired."
4718,Ben,Do you want go?
4719,Bonnie,"I was going to say let's have some more coffee,Get a caffeine buzz,"
4720,Ben,"Hmm, like what?"
4721,Bonnie,Like anything.
4722,Ben,Okay.
4723,Bonnie,I'm going to run to the restroom.
4724,Ben,Okay.
4725,Bonnie,All right.
4726,Stefan,What?
4727,Elena,Not many girls can say they've done this.[Stefan opens the coffin]Is that it?
4728,Damon," Well, what do you know?This is an interesting turn of events."
4729,Stefan,I can't let you bring her back. I'm sorry.
4730,Damon,So am I. For thinking for even a second That I can trust you.
4731,Stefan,Oh. You're not capable of trust. The fact that you're here means that you read the journal And you were planning on doing this yourself.
4732,Damon,"Of course I was going to do it by myself,Because the only one I can count on is me!You made sure of that many years ago, Stefan. But you...[He looks at Elena]You had me fooled. So what are you going to do now?Because if you try and destroy that,I'll rip her heart out."
4733,Stefan,You won't k*ll her.
4734,Damon,"[He caught Elena]I can do one better.[He forces her to drink his bl*od]Give me the book,Stefan. Or I'm stabbing her neck. And you and I will have a vampire girlfriend."
4735,Stefan,Let her go first.
4736,Damon,Drop it.
4737,Stefan,I'm not going to give this to you Until she is standing next to me.
4738,Damon,"Problem is, I no longer trust That you'll give it back!"
4739,Stefan,You just did the one thing that ensures that I will.
4740,Damon,Stop! No don't take her!
4741,Giuseppe,Do you know what they'll do to you If you're branded a sympathizer?You'll be k*ll along with them!
4742,Damon,Just let me be k*ll!
4743,Elena,My head supposed to hurt like this?
4744,Stefan,"Oh, you'll be fine. That was just A small amount of bl*od. It should pass out of"
4745,Elena,Are you OK?
4746,Stefan,"Damon was right. This is, uh...This is my fault."
4747,Stefan,"Damon!Damon! Stop, stop. I'll help you. We'll get her back."
4748,Damon,Help me?!Don't you think you've done enough?You promised you wouldn't tell him!
4749,Stefan,I didn't think this would happen.
4750,Damon,You did this. This is your fault.
4751,Stefan,"I put my faith in my father,But Damon put his faith in me,And I destroyed that. This is my fault."
4752,Elena,You didn't do anything wrong. Don't forget that.
4753,Stefan,Okay.[She exhales]I'm going to get you that aspirin.
4754,Elena,Okay.
4755,Jenna,"You know you're not staying the night, right?"
4756,Stefan,We're just going to hang out For a little while.
4757,Jenna,You're lucky I like you. Keep the door open.
4758,Stefan,"You got it. Hey, do you have any aspirin."
4759,Jenna,Yeah.
4760,Jeremy,"Oh, hey, Stefan. Where's she go?"
4761,Jenna,She went to the bathroom.
4762,Stefan,Where's who go?
4763,Jenna,He has a friend over.
4764,Jeremy,Anna.
4765,Anna,What's happening?
4766,Pearl,Get Emily. Stay hidden. I'll get us out of here.
4767,Jonathan,Pearl!
4768,Pearl,Jonathan!
4769,Jonathan,Do you see all this?The town's gone mad running after the demons. You!
4770,Pearl,Jonathan...Please. I beg you!
4771,Jonathan,I've got another one over here!
4772,Anna,Mother!
4773,Emily,"Shh, shh!"
4774,Man,Come on!This way!
4775,Emily,Shh!It'll be all right. You're going to see her again. We will protect them. I'm going to protect them.
4776,Stefan,Elena.
4777,Ben,I wouldn't.Don't try to escape.Don't even move.Do you understand?
4778,Elena,I understand.
4779,Anna,Seriously?!
4780,Ben,I told her not to moove!I did that eye thing you taught me.
4781,Anna,You forgot the lesson about vervain.[She grabs Elena]She takes a vampire
4782,Elena,Who are you?What do you want?
4783,Elena,"Bonnie?Oh, my god!"
4784,Stefan,Anna took elena.
4785,Damon,"Yeah, I got that from your 600 voicemails."
4786,Stefan,"Damon, all night long,every single street in town,I've been searching.What if your bl*od hasn't passed out of her system?"
4787,Damon,"Well, then at least you know you'll see her again."
4788,Stefan,Please.What do you know?You were with anna. You must know where she's living.Just tell me where I can find her.
4789,Damon,Nope.You can go.Really.
4790,Stefan,"You know, all I can remember is hating you.There might have been a time"
4791,Damon,Apology accepted.
4792,Stefan,"So please,Just tell me what you know.It's elena, damon.If you know something...Tell me."
4793,Damon,I mean this sincerely.I hope elena dies.
4794,Elena,Bonnie.
4795,Bonnie,Elena?
4796,Elena,"Oh, you're ok!"
4797,Bonnie,My head...
4798,Elena,Come here.
4799,Bonnie,"Oh, my god! Ben is a-"
4800,Elena,Shh. [whispering]they can hear.
4801,Bonnie,I was so stupid!
4802,Elena,"Oh, he had all of us fooled."
4803,Bonnie,What's going on?Why are we here?
4804,Elena,It must have something to do with the tomb and emily's spell book.
4805,Bonnie,Spell book?
4806,Elena,Damon said that it could be used To open the tomb.
4807,Bonnie,Why didn't I know about any of this?
4808,Elena,"I was trying to keep you out of it,Hoping it would never come to this."
4809,Bonnie,Come to what?
4810,Elena,They need a witch...To break the spell an let the vampires out.
4811,Bonnie,No way.
4812,Elena,I Know-
4813,Bonnie,You're wasting your time.I'm not going to help you.
4814,Ben,"That's why she's here.[He grabs Elena]Motivation for you to behave.You know, you shouldn't be so desperate.You made it too easy.[He pushes Elena in the other room]she needs to talk to you."
4815,Anna,Elena gilbert.You really are katherine's doppelganger.You must have
4816,Elena,Who are you?
4817,Anna,"I'm anna.Your brother may have mentioned me.I mean, we're, like,"
4818,Tyler,Ten kegs?You know how much damage we could do with ten kegs?Duke's got it all hooked up.
4819,Matt,Duke's a douche.
4820,Tyler,"Yeah, a douche with ten kegs.Aka, my new best friend.[Jeremy laughes]What's the problem,gilbert?"
4821,Jeremy,"Don't have one,lockwood."
4822,Tyler,"Yeah, I didn't think so."
4823,Matt,You ever get bored of it?
4824,Tyler,Of what?
4825,Matt,Yourself?
4826,Tyler,"Keep laughing, buddy."
4827,Caroline,"Hey, jeremy.Where is elena?I have been texting her and bonnie All day about duke's party."
4828,Jeremy,"Uh, she went somewhere with stefan."
4829,Caroline,I am so not going to be one of those girls Who disappears just because
4830,Jeremy,Who is duke?
4831,Caroline,Some guy that graduated a couple years ago.And he throws a party every
4832,Jeremy,"Wait, duke goes to duke?"
4833,Caroline,His real name is bob or something.He's a total ass. But he buys the beer.Maybe you should come.
4834,Jeremy,"Uh, yeah. -I don't think so."
4835,Caroline,"No, seriously.Everyone goes.Even quiet loner little brothers.Think about it."
4836,Caroline,Hey!
4837,Matt,Hey.
4838,Caroline,So I have speech.It is fully scripted and well-rehearsed.Are you ready
4839,Matt,You wrote a speech?
4840,Caroline,"Yes.It's a ""you kissed me And I don't want things to be weird"" speech.It's pre-emptive."
4841,Matt,[He chuckles]pre-emptive.
4842,Caroline,"Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts Or regrets Or were,like, ooged out-"
4843,Matt,"Ooged, huh?"
4844,Caroline,Can I just get on with the speech part?
4845,Matt,"Yeah, go for it."
4846,Caroline,"So I know that you don't think That this is going to work out between us.I just want to let you know that right here and right now,I'm offering you an out.Like an escape clause."
4847,Matt,Why are you giving me an escape clause?
4848,Caroline,I don't want to make assumptions about what it is we are doing here.
4849,Matt,Got it.
4850,Caroline,"So, if you would like to exercise it,Just let me know."
4851,Matt,"I'm good, but thanks."
4852,Caroline,Ok.Good.

4858,Grams,She's not here.
4859,Damon,"Oh, do you know when she would be-"
4860,Grams,Never.
4861,Damon,You have quite an opinion for someone who doesn't know me.
4862,Grams,You got some nerve knocking on a bennett witch's door And asking her
4863,Damon,What'd I do?
4864,Grams,"Spirits talk,mr. Salvatore,And so does my granddaughter.You are no friend to us.Now get off my porch."
4865,Damon,Step outside and say that.
4866,Grams,I am not bonnie.You don't want to mess with me.
4867,Elena,Bonnie's not going to open the tomb.
4868,Anna,"Oh, I think she will."
4869,Elena,Do you really want katherine out that bad?
4870,Anna,"Trust me.No one I know wants to see that girl again.Except damon,"
4871,Elena,Then what is it?Or who is it?
4872,Anna,"My mother's in there.Katherine couldn't help herself.She just had two boy around With both of the salvatore brothers.And when she get caught,So did my mother.I watched jonathan gilbert take her away."
4873,Elena,I'm sorry.
4874,Anna,"You really mean that, don't you?Yeah, I think we'll skip The dead mom bonding so you can start serving a purpose."
4875,Elena,Which is what?
4876,Anna,"Leverage.This belong to you?[Elena tries to take the phone]Ah, ah."
4877,Stefan,"Elena, are you ok?"
4878,Anna,"She's fine,for now.Tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine."
4879,Stefan,I can't get it.
4880,Anna,Which means your brother has it.And I have the witch.So one of you
4881,Damon,"Go ahead.Grovel again.Oh, wait, no.I don't care."
4882,Anna,I'm leaving.[Ben comes with Bonnie]Keep them buttoned down.Compulsion won't work.Just use violence.
4883,Ben,Right.I got that.Sit. Behave.You're the key to this.Literally.The one who opens
4884,Elena,Is there anything to drink here?
4885,Ben,Are you offering?There's water on the nightstand.
4886,Bonnie,Hey. Can I have a sip?
4887,Ben,"Whoa![He grabs Elena]Come back in,shut the door!"
4888,Bonnie,Don't hurt her!
4889,Ben,Don't make me![Bonnie closes the door]Lock it.
4890,Jeremy,"Anna!Hey, what, uh,What happened to you last night?"
4891,Anna,"Sorry,I had to leave.I told your sister to tell you."
4892,Jeremy,"Oh, I haven't seen her."
4893,Anna,"Well, I gotta run, so-"
4894,Jeremy,"Hey, do you want to go to a party tonight?"
4895,Anna,Do I what?
4896,Jeremy,"The guy that's throwing it is a total douche,But it's, uh, it's supposed to be fun.I figured, you know, safety in numbers."
4897,Anna,"[She chuckles]so you're finally ready to go out with me, are you?"
4898,Jeremy,"It's been a while since I've been to a party,And I kindwant to get back out there.And not be such a lor.And, uh, I like you.You're fun, and you're also kind of Strange and lurky, but,h,I guess I like that, too.So, yeah, you should come to the party. With me.It's in the woods by that old cemetery."
4899,Anna,"Oh.It's there, huh?That sounds cool.Uh, I'll meet you."
4900,Jeremy,Oh-ok! Great!Cool.Ok!
4901,Damon,"Got a hot date,Or are you just planning on nabbing the entire gilbert family?"
4902,Anna,"A party, right next to the old cemetery.Isn't that nice of them?Lots of warm bodys for starving vampires."
4903,Damon,I told you.I work alone.
4904,Anna,"Yeah, so do I.But you're minus a witch And I'm minus spell book.So what do you say?"
4905,Damon,"Stefan will come after you, you know that.For messing with elena."
4906,Anna,Then he won't be too happy if I k*ll her When I don't get what want.
4907,Damon,When do you want to do this?
4908,Anna,"God, it's like 1864 all over again.You salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women.Tonight. After sundown.Meet at the church."
4909,Ben,"Witches don't have eternal life, right?So you guys can die."
4910,Bonnie,"Yeah, we can die."
4911,Ben,Ah!That sucks.
4912,Elena,Stefan!
4913,Stefan,"Let's get outside.[He approach Ben]When the sun goes down,Leave town.If I ever see you again,I will k*ll you."
4914,Bonnie,How did you know where we were?
4915,Grams,"Many things can feel a witch's power.Worry, anger.After stefan told me that they had taken you, I had a lot of both.Simple locator spell was easy after that."
4916,Bonnie,I'm sorry.About all of this.
4917,Grams,Not as sorry as they're gonna be.
4918,Elena,So what do we do now?
4919,Stefan,"For now, you need to stay here."
4920,Grams,"A prisoner,in my own home?I don't think so."
4921,Stefan,I can't protect you if you leave the house.
4922,Grams,We'll protect ourselves.
4923,Elena,"We need to let him have katherine back.He's not going to stop until he gets her.If we help him,maybe that ends it."
4924,Bonnie,No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
4925,Elena,What other choice do we have?
4926,Grams,Witches being pulled down by vampire problems.As much as we tried
4927,Stefan,We still have to get damon to agree.
4928,Elena,He already agreed once.
4929,Stefan,"Yeah, and then we double cross him.So now he's angry."
4930,Elena,He's hurt. There's a difference.I think I know what I have to do.
4931,Anna,You've got to be kidding me.
4932,Ben,It was stefan.There was nothing I could-
4933,Anna,"Shut up! Stop talking.Without the witch,We don't have damon or the grimoire.Damon's not going to stop.He'll find a way to get in.And we're going to be"
4934,Damon,I'm going to have to change the locks.Did you stage a jailbreak?
4935,Elena,Stefan.
4936,Damon,"Oh, brother.Ever the white knight."
4937,Elena,I convinced bonnie to help you.
4938,Damon,I doubt that.
4939,Elena,"I'm not going to say that I'm sorry We got the grimoire without you last night,Because I'm not, really."
4940,Damon,"Well, at least you're honest."
4941,Elena,"I was protecting the people I love, damon.But so were you,In your own,"
4942,Damon,Not interested.
4943,Elena,"Yes, you are.Because you were willing to work with us yesterday."
4944,Damon,"Fool once,shame on you."
4945,Elena,"Ok, when we were in atlanta,Why didn't you use your compulsion on me?"
4946,Damon,Who's to say I didn't?
4947,Elena,"You didn't.I know you didn't.But you could have.You and I...We have something.An understanding.And I know that my betrayal hurt you,Different from how it is with you and Stefan,But I'm promising you this now,I ll help you get katherine back."
4948,Damon,I wish I could believe you.
4949,Elena,Ask me if I'm lying now.
4950,Damon,"No animal will stop, by the way,No matter what I do."
4951,Elena,Then we'll deal with it.
4952,Damon,I didn't compel you in atlanta because we were having fun.I wanted it to be real.I'm trusting you.Don't make me regret it.
4953,Elena,The duke party.I forgot.I hope they stay clear of the church.
4954,Damon,"Your hope, not mine."
4955,Matt," Elena, hey."
4956,Caroline,"Elena, oh, my god.Where have you been?"
4957,Damon,"Long story,no time to tell it."
4958,Caroline,Wasn't talking to you.
4959,Damon,Sure you were.
4960,Matt,We haven't met.I'm matt.
4961,Damon,"Matt, there's a reason we haven't met.[He pushes Elena]You and I are"
4962,Elena,"Ahhh. I'm sorry,you guys."
4963,Stefan,Cleared the debris away.Set the torches like you asked.We can get down now.
4964,Grams,What is that?
4965,Stefan,It's everything I need to destroy them.
4966,Grams,Are you sure damon will come back with her?
4967,Damon,"Brother, witches."
4968,Stefan,Everything ok?
4969,Elena,I just want to get this over with.Are we ready?
4970,Bonnie,I guess so.
4971,Tyler,"Done!Hey, uh,I'll be right back.[He gets into Jeremy]Hey, man.Uh, you got any weed?"
4972,Jeremy,"Wait, you're kidding me,right?You act like a total dick every time we cross paths,And now you want to party with me?"
4973,Tyler,You're not Gilbert.I'm just asking question.
4974,Jeremy,"Dude, I don't get you, man."
4975,Tyler,"It's a party.You're a partier, ok?There's no need to psychoanalyze it."
4976,Jeremy,"I don't party anymore.And even if I did, it wouldn't be with you."
4977,Tyler,"No problem.Carry on just standing there, by yourself.All alone.The enemy of fun.Do you even have any friends?"
4978,Jeremy,Thanks god.
4979,Anna,"Weird hello, but ok.What's the matter?"
4980,Jeremy,"Uh, nothin'.Nothing, just...It's nothin'."
4981,Anna,"Come on, let walk."
4982,Grams,Air.Earth.Fire.
4983,Bonnie,Water.
4984,Elena,"That's it, just water from the tap?"
4985,Grams,As opposed to what?
4986,Elena,I just figured maybit would have to be blessed Or mystical or something.
4987,Stefan,What's that?
4988,Damon,It's for katherine.Gotta have something to get her going.Unless your girl's
4989,Stefan,I can't wait to get rid of you.
4990,Damon,Hmm.
4991,Bonnie,You ready?
4992,Anna,This place is wild.
4993,Jeremy,"You kinda like dead people, huh?"
4994,Anna,"I'm strange, remember?You ok?"
4995,Jeremy,"Yeah, yeah. Uh...This place makes me think about someone."
4996,Anna,A dead someone?
4997,Jeremy,"No, no, just...Someone I used to know.So, uh, hey.We made it all of, what, 37 minutes in that party?"
4998,Anna,Not your scene?
4999,Jeremy,"No, I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore."
5000,Anna,Hmm.
5001,Jeremy,So what do you say?You want to be part of my non-scene?
5002,Anna,"I would happily be a part of your non-scene,Except, uh,I'm leaving."
5003,Jeremy,"Wait, what?"
5004,Anna,Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
5005,Jeremy,"Oh, uh...That's- that's a bummer."
5006,Anna,Yeah?
5007,Jeremy,"Well,Yeah."
5008,Anna,Guess this is good-bye.
5009,Jeremy,I guess it is.
5010,Jeremy,"Anna, your face!"
5011,Anna,It's nothing.
5012,Jeremy,It didn't look like nothing.
5013,Anna,you didn't have to hit him that hard.
5014,Ben,"Yes, I did."
5015,Anna,"Grab him, and let's go.I'm taking him to meet my mother."
5016,Tyler,"Hey,Where's your date?"
5017,Matt,Who knows?
5018,Tyler,"Ah, is the honeymoon over already?"
5019,Matt,Maybe.
5020,Tyler,After all that grief you gave me about liking her.I figured it would have lasted
5021,Matt,"Look, I just- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.She-she seems like she might be a little clingy."
5022,Tyler,"Well, good.I need my boy single anyway.Ooh.Incoming."
5023,Caroline,Hey.There you are.
5024,Matt,Here I am.
5025,Tyler,"Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough,So I'm just going to go get another beer."
5026,Caroline,So...
5027,Matt,So.
5028,Caroline,I have another speech.
5029,Matt,Ok.
5030,Caroline,"The hand thing with elena,It was lame.Well, I was lame.And, hey, your feelings for elena aside,Damon was there,And he was always such a jerk to me.And...I wanted to show off that I was with the good guy.So, anyway, I was lame.So...Forgiven?"
5031,Matt,"Yeah, course.Yeah."
5032,Damon,What it's that?
5033,Stefan,It sounds like latin.
5034,Elena,I don't think it's latin.
5035,Elena,What's happening?
5036,Bonnie,It worked!
5037,Grams,Of course it worked.
5038,Damon,Weave some fires to build.
5039,Stefan,"I'm gonna go get the gasolin, I'll be right back."
5040,Damon,You ready?
5041,Elena,What?
5042,Damon,You think I'm going to go in there by myself So you can seal me in?
5043,Elena,Don't take her in.I'll bring the walls down.
5044,Damon,You'll bring walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
5045,Grams,As much as I trust you.
5046,Elena,"Enough!Both of you.Look, he needs leverage.He needs to know that you're not going To shut the door when he gets inside.I get it.I'll go."
5047,Damon,May I?
5048,Ben,Dark down there?
5049,Stefan,I thought I told you to leave.
5050,Ben,"I considered it.Then I thought,screw you."
5051,Anna," Hey, hero.I'm going down there to get my mother."
5052,Stefan,Can't let you do that.
5053,Anna,"Well, ben's about to make a main course Out of elena's little brother,So you can stop me or him.Your choice."
5054,Elena,What is that?
5055,Damon,They can sense you.Where is she?!
5056,Elena,Damon!
5057,Bonnie,"Hey, you're not going in there."
5058,Anna,You think you can stop me?
5059,Grams,Bonnie...
5060,Bonnie,Why did you let her go in?
5061,Grams,"Because she isn't coming out, baby.None of them are."
5062,Stefan,Do you really think she cares about you hmm?You're disposable.
5063,Ben,I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
5064,Stefan,"You're going to say ""eternal life""?You're really that stupid?"
5065,Ben,"You know,I've heard about you.You don't feed.You're not strong enough"
5066,Stefan,No.I got this.[He burns him with the gasoline]
5067,Elena,Damon?[She whisper]Damon!
5068,Stefan,Where's elena?
5069,Bonnie,Damon took her inside.
5070,Stefan,What?!
5071,Grams,"Stefan!If you go in there,you won't come out."
5072,Stefan,What did you do?
5073,Grams,"Opening the door didn't remove the seal,It just opened the door."
5074,Stefan,What's the seal?
5075,Grams,Some seals keep vampires from entering.This one keeps them from...Coming out.
5076,Stefan,"Elena's human.She can leave.Anna and katherine can't.Damon can't.You weren't even planning on breaking the spell,Were you?"
5077,Grams,I told you.I will protect my own.Elena can get out.That's all that matters.
5078,Anna,"You must have a taste for it.You scream and shriek and even bother to escape,But then you just come right back to it.[Elena steps on something]Mother!Your boyfriend did this, you know."
5079,Elena,His father did.
5080,Anna,"And jonathan gilbert.Made a choice a long time agoThat it would be gilbert bl*od That brought her back to life.I had jeremy all ready to go,But..."
5081,Bonnie,"Stefan!You can't just leave him in there, grams!"
5082,Grams,He made his choice!
5083,Bonnie,No.Here.[She tooks the grimoire]Just tell me what to do. I'll do it!
5084,Grams,"We are not strong enough.Even if we were able to bring the seal down,There's no guarantee that we can get it back up again."
5085,Bonnie,You said it yourself-Many things can fuel a witch's power.Help me!Or I'll do it alone.
5086,Elena,Please don't!No!
5087,Stefan,Let her go![He Grabs Anna]
5088,Anna,No!
5089,Stefan,"Go, go. I'll be right behind you."
5090,Pearl, Anna!Where am I?
5091,Bonnie,"Elena, stefan..."
5092,Elena,He's right behind me.Stefan what are you doing?
5093,Grams,It's gonna be ok.
5094,Bonnie,We'll fix it.
5095,Stefan,I can't.
5096,Elena,Can't?Can't what?
5097,Bonnie,"The spell's still up,we can't get them out.Yet."
5098,Elena,"You went in there not knowing If you could come back out?Oh, my god."
5099,Stefan,I heard you scream.
5100,Elena,"We can't leave him in there.We promised him, both of us."
5101,Stefan,I know.
5102,Grams,"Even if we're able to break through the seal,We won't be able to hold it for long."
5103,Damon,She's not here!
5104,Stefan,Damon:
5105,Damon,She's not here.
5106,Stefan,What?
5107,Damon,She's not here!
5108,Elena,I think it's working!
5109,Anna,I just wanted my mother back.Jeremy's fine. He's outside. We won't touch him.
5110,Grams,Bonnie!Keep going!You better hury.
5111,Elena,"Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!"
5112,Stefan,"Damon, we need to get out of here."
5113,Damon,It doesn't make sense.They locked her inside.
5114,Stefan,"If we don't leave now,We're not getting out."
5115,Damon,How could she not be in here?
5116,Stefan,It's not worth spending all of eternity down here!She's not worth it!
5117,Damon,No!
5118,Elena, Damon!Please.
5119,Bonnie,"oh, my god!I can't!"
5120,Grams,Yes you can.
5121,Matt,Is this for real?
5122,Caroline,Is what for real?
5123,Matt,You being all cool and honest and open?
5124,Caroline,Speech number three?I want this to work.And I'm scared that you're
5125,Matt,"I don't want to mess it up, either."
5126,Stefan,He's ok.He's all right.
5127,Elena,I'm sorry.
5128,Bonnie,"Hey, let me help you."
5129,Grams,"Oh, I'm fine.You don't need to coddle me, baby."
5130,Bonnie,"It was a big spell, grams.I could tell it took a lot out of you."
5131,Grams,I'll be fine.
5132,Elena,How's your head?
5133,Jeremy,"Oh,, it's, uh,it's all right.I just-I wish I knew how I pass out.I didn't drink"
5134,Elena,And you don't remember anything?
5135,Jeremy,The whole thing's pretty cloudy. I just...I know how this looks.I'm-I'm sorry.
5136,Elena,"No, Jeremy,don't be sorry.You didn't do anything, ok?"
5137,Jeremy,Ok.
5138,Elena,"I've gotta head over to bonnie's for a little bit,But is there anything"
5139,Jeremy,"Oh, no, I'm just-I'm gonna crash."
5140,Elena,"Ok. Well, jenna's here,and I'll be back soon."
5141,Damon,You knew katherine wasn't in there.
5142,Anna,You wouldn't have helped me.
5143,Pearl,No!
5144,Damon,Why do you get happiness?
5145,Anna,"Damon, please, you wouldn't have helped me! You know you wouldn't!"
5146,Damon,Why do you get it and I don't?!
5147,Pearl,"The guard,the one at the church,the one who locked us in ,she promised to turn him,he was obsessed with her.She had him under her spell like everybody else.He let her go."
5148,Anna,"The last I saw her Was chicago.1983.She knew where you were, damon.She didn't care.Sorry."
5149,Elena,I just got to bonnie's.
5150,Stefan,Everything all right?
5151,Elena,Yeah.How's damon?Is he going to be ok?
5152,Stefan,I don't know.Can I call you later?
5153,Elena,"Yeah, of course."
5154,Bonnie,"Here it is Grams.Grams.Grams? Grams Wake up.Grams?Grams?Elena!Help.Wake up!She's not breathing!She's not breathing!Please, wake up!I'm gonna fix it!"
5155,Elena,"Yes, I need an ambulance."
5156,Bonnie,"It's ok, I can fix this."
5157,Elena,It's an emergency.Bonnie!Bonnie!Bonnie!
5158,Bonnie,"No, no!I can fix this!"
5159,Elena,Bonnie!Bonnie!
5160,Bonnie,"Grams, I can fix this!"
5161,Elena,Bonnie!
5162,Man,Jeez! You scared me.
5163,Harper,Do you know what day it is?
5164,Man,It's Saturday.
5165,Harper,And what year?
5166,Man,It's 2010. Are you OK?
5167,Harper,Thank you.
5168,Man,"Wait, what's your name?"
5169,Harper,"It's Harper, sir."
5170,Man,How did you get out here?And why are you dressed like that?
5171,Harper,You seem like a very nice person. I'm sorry.
5172,Man,Sorry for what?
5173,Elena,"Hey, bonnie, it's me just checking in,Seeing how you're doing. We miss you here. Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy. Come home soon. Love you."
5174,Jenna,What are you doin' out here?It's cold.
5175,Elena,"Thinking, writing. The, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma,It brought back a lot about mom and dad. I was wondering. You said that you would do some digging about them,The adoption."
5176,Jenna,Right.
5177,Elena,So did you? Dig?
5178,Jenna,Come on inside. Your dad kept everything from his medical practice--
5179,Elena,Do you think that's her real name?
5180,Jenna,"Pregnant teenage runaway?Probably not. First name, maybe. But where's she get peterson?Classmate? Best friend?So I binged it. IIII searched for all the petersons in this area Born the same year as isobel, found 3--2 men and a woman, trudie,Who lived in grove hilVirginia.ia."
5181,Elena,That's not far from here.
5182,Jenna," Well, watch this."
5183,Elena,Isobel.She was a cheerleader.
5184,Jenna,Trudie still lives there.This is her address.
5185,Elena,What about isobel?
5186,Jenna,"I couldn't find anything about her.Listen. There's something else.Mr. Saltzman, rick,His wife was from around here,And her name was also isobel."
5187,Elena,"Wait. ""was,"" as in..."
5188,Jenna,She died.
5189,Stefan,Alaric's wife might have been your mother?
5190,Elena,"it can't be true, right?I mean, the coincidence alone is just crazy.I have the address for her friend trudie."
5191,Stefan,"You wanna talk to her.I don't know. I... I--I don't know.If it's true and they are the same person,That means that my birth mother is dead,And I don't know if I could handle that."
5192,Stefan,"Elena, did jenna tell you anything about alaric's wife?How she died?"
5193,Elena,Just that she was k*ll and the case was never solved.You knew that already?
5194,Stefan,"The night at the school when he attacked me,He told me some things about her death."
5195,Elena,Well--
5196,Stefan,"no, no. It's not possible.The coincidence is-- it's too much.Now, listen, if you do decide to go Talk to isobel's friend,I'll go with you. Ok?"
5197,Elena,I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
5198,Stefan,I should get goin'.I gotta go deal with damon.
5199,Elena,How's he doing?
5200,Stefan,He's dealing in his own way.
5201,Girl,How do I taste?
5202,Damon,"Oh, so much better than your friends.But shh. Don't tell them."
5203,Stefan,Can we talk?
5204,Damon,Yeah.
5205,Stefan,Without the tri-delts.
5206,Damon,"Anything you have to say to me,You can say in front of them.They're really good at keeping secrets.[They talk alone]You're worried about me.That's nice. Don't be.There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?Spent the last 145 years with one goal,Get in that tomb. I succeeded.Granted, katherine wasn't in there to be rescued,But why dwell?No, it's so liberating not having a master plan,Because I can do whatever the hell I want."
5207,Stefan,That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
5208,Damon,Relax. I haven't k*ll anyone in-- too long.
5209,Stefan,Those girls?
5210,Damon,"Will end up in their dorm with headaches,Think they blacked out. Business as usual.Predictable you didn't pull me over here for a pep talk.So drink up. Spill it, brother."
5211,Stefan,There was a woman you may have known a few years back Named isobel in north carolina at duke.
5212,Damon,You wanna discuss the women in my past right now? Seriously?
5213,Stefan,You k*ll her.
5214,Damon,What's your point?
5215,Stefan,I just--just wanna know if you remember anything about her.
5216,Damon,"Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, stefan."
5217,Stefan,"Well, think hard. It's important."
5218,Damon,"Nothing is important, not anymore.Great chat.I have to go and exploit some"
5219,Matt,What?
5220,Caroline,This is boring. I'm bored.
5221,Matt,Waouh
5222,Caroline,"But we have this entire house to ourselves.I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad."
5223,Matt,And...
5224,Caroline,So shouldn't we do something A little bit more bachelor-paddy?
5225,Matt,What? Something like this?[He kiss her]
5226,Caroline,Something like that.
5227,Matt, I don't know.This is a pretty good show.
5228,Caroline,Seriously?
5229,Kelly,"Oh, god. Not on my couch."
5230,Matt,Mom. Hey.
5231,Alaric,"I don't know. It's just weird, you know,Me being raffled off like a disney cruise."
5232,Jenna,"In this town, Fundraising is like indentured servitude.You don't have a choice.Besides, you're a bachelor,And you're eligible, so there you go."
5233,Alaric,Here. Let me help you with this.
5234,Jenna,"Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this."
5235,Alaric,What?
5236,Jenna,"I am totally gonna ruin this moment,But I--I have to tell you.Elena recently found out she was adopted,And she's been looking for her birth mother...Whose name was isobel."
5237,Alaric,Isobel? Like my wife?Isobel never had a baby.
5238,Jenna,Are you sure?Not before you were together?
5239,Alaric,Nope. No way.
5240,Jenna,This is elena's birth mother.
5241,Alaric,"Ah, she, uh-- She never told me.I, uh-- I'm gonna go.Yeah, I'm gonna-- gonna go."
5242,Elena,Trudie? Tru-trudie peterson?
5243,Trudie,Yes
5244,Elena," Uh, my name is elena gilbert.I wanted to talk to you about isobel flemming."
5245,Trudie,"Well, I haven't heard that name in years.How do you know her?"
5246,Elena,"I think that, um, well...Do you know if she had a baby that she gave up for adoption?"
5247,Trudie,My god. You're her daughter.I was just gonna make some tea.
5248,Elena,Sure
5249,Trudie,"Uh, the kitchen's this way."
5250,Elena,"I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was,But I was driving, and I hit this stoplight,And it made me think about when I was learning How to drive and then my mom would always warn me About this blind turn on the left-hand side,And then I was thinking about my mom, and--I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in."
5251,Trudie,"It's no problem. Just a surprise, though.I haven't thought about isobel in years."
5252,Elena,When was the last time you saw her?
5253,Trudie,"About 17 years ago,When she left to go have you.We kept in touch for a while, But, well, you know, people drift apart."
5254,Elena,And you don't know where she ended up?
5255,Trudie,She was in florida for a while.She was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.
5256,Elena,Do you have any idea who my father is?
5257,Trudie,"I could never get her to fess up.Anyway, she finally pulled it together,"
5258,Elena,Where did she go?
5259,Trudie,"Somewhere in north carolina.Duke, I think. Smart girl, smart school.Let me just grab that.[She send a message to Isobel]"
5260,Matt,So it's been a few months. Where you been?
5261,Kelly,"Ah, you know, here and there,Never one place too long.You know pete."
5262,Matt," No, actually, I don't,Because you never brought him around."
5263,Kelly,"So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh?So sorry I scared her off."
5264,Matt,"She's not a flavor, mom. I like her."
5265,Kelly,So she's the one?
5266,Matt,"No,probably not, but maybe."
5267,Kelly,"Matt, seriously,lezzie forbes' daughter? Ucch."
5268,Matt,"Mom, seriously, Knock it off."
5269,Kelly,"Ice, please."
5270,Matt,"So, uh, you heard from vic?"
5271,Kelly,"No, but don't worry.She'll come home eventually when she needs something."
5272,Matt,Are you playing it now?
5273,Kelly,No.
5274,Matt,Then what are you doin' home?
5275,Kelly,"You trying to say I need a reason to come back?Sit down. Eat with me.Tell me everything I've missed, hmm."
5276,Alaric,Thanks for meeting me. Something's come up.
5277,Stefan,Jenna told you.
5278,Alaric,Yeah.
5279,Stefan,So it's true.Your wife isobel was elena's birth mother.
5280,Alaric,What does elena know?
5281,Stefan,about your wife?
5282,Alaric,"About everything. About you, your brother."
5283,Stefan,"She knows what I am,And she knows that you know about the vampires."
5284,Alaric,Does she know about damon and isobel?
5285,Stefan,"No. I couldn't tell her,not until I was sure."
5286,Alaric,You said you'd help me.
5287,Stefan,I asked damon without saying too much.He doesn't remember.
5288,Alaric,Ask him again.
5289,Stefan,Damon is not stable right now.
5290,Alaric,"You know, he m*rder my wife Or at the very least made a meal out of her.When has he been stable?"
5291,Stefan,I'm telling you not to push this.
5292,Alaric,Give me a reason not to.
5293,Stefan,Your survival
5294,Alaric,How's that for a reason?
5295,Stefan,"I'll handle it, but for now,I need you to let it go."
5296,Alaric,Is that what you'll tell elena?Let it go?
5297,Stefan,Leave elena out of this.
5298,Alaric,"I need to know what happened.I think you would, too."
5299,Stefan,"I need something more than just your wife's name,A picture, something I could show damon."
5300,Isobel,Just a few more minutes.
5301,Alaric,"Can't you, uh--Can't you finish this in the morning?"
5302,Isobel,But I like working at night.
5303,Alaric,"Yeah. See, I like sleeping at night.With you.Ok, I'll bite. What is it, thesis stuff?Look, baby, I'm in a 3-way here with you and your computer,The least you can do is let me know what you're up to."
5304,Isobel,"I was doing research, And I dug up all this stuff About this small town in"
5305,Alaric,"Ok. I'll get my garlic and holy water,And then maybe, just maybe..."
5306,Isobel,No.
5307,Alaric,We can get some sleep. Come here.
5308,Isobel,No.
5309,Alaric,"Look, this is why I love you,Because you believe in all of this stuff,So much so that you're making a degree out of it.You're like mulder, except hotter and a girl."
5310,Isobel,"This is not a joke, rick.You think that this is cute,But I'm gonna prove it."
5311,Trudie,Ah. They came to the games for us.The football team hadn't won in years.
5312,Elena,Heh. This is great. Thank you.
5313,Trudie,You're welcome.You haven't touched your tea.
5314,Elena,Oh. Yeah.[She drinks]What is this?
5315,Trudie,"Oh, it's just some herbal mixture."
5316,Elena,Vervain?You know.
5317,Trudie,Know what?
5318,Elena,"You didn't invite me in,And you're serving vervain tea.You know."
5319,Trudie,I think that you should probably leave.
5320,Elena,Wait. What are you not telling me?

5346,Trudie,You're welcome. I didn't tell her anything.I--I kept my promise.
5347,Man,Good.
5348,Trudie,"The girl, though, She--she knew something."
5349,Man,That won't be a problem.She won't get any closer to the truth.
5350,Trudie,Good. So I'm done?
5351,Man,Yes. You're done.
5352,Trudie,No! I won't invite you in.You can't come in!

5358,Elena,"You look, um..."
5359,Damon,Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?
5360,Elena,Wrecked.You look wrecked.
5361,Damon,No reason why.Do you know that I am one of mystic falls' most eligible bachelors?
5362,Elena,Huh.
5363,Damon,Yep.
5364,Elena,How are you doing?
5365,Damon,Never better.Yep. What can I do for you?I'm a barrel of favors today.It's my newfound purpose-how can I help people?
5366,Elena,I'm just meeting stefan.We're going to the fundraiser.
5367,Damon,"Help a guy out, will you? Can't get this."
5368,Elena,So I found out who my birth mother is.
5369,Damon,Ecch. Who cares?She left you. She sucks.
5370,Elena,Stefan. There you are.
5371,Damon,"Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know,An occasional sorority girl might, um,You know, help fill you out a little bit."
5372,Elena,He's fine.

5375,Stefan,Won't hold my breath.
5376,Elena,So I went to see trudie peterson.I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.
5377,Stefan,How was it?
5378,Elena,"She has vervain.She knows about vampire stuff,And it can't be a coincidence."
5379,Stefan,It isn't. This is alaric's wife.
5380,Elena,This is her. This is isobel.He gave this to you?
5381,Stefan,"Everything he knows about vampires,he learned from her.He believes that she was k*ll by one."
5382,Elena,"Oh, my god."
5383,Stefan,"Listen, elena, there's a lot About isobel that alaric can tell you,But I need you to hold off a little while Before you talk to him."
5384,Elena,Why?
5385,Stefan,"I know that it's a lot to ask of you,But will you do that for me?"
5386,Carol,Tickets for the raffle are now on sale.All proceeds benefit the annual

5388,Alaric,What? Embarrassing and uncomfortable?
5389,Jenna,Yep. That's-- that's the one.
5390,Alaric,"Hey, look. I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.It was just kind of a--a shock."
5391,Jenna,"Well, I'm sorry for dropping it on you,But I felt like you should know."
5392,Alaric,"No, I get it."
5393,Jenna,"At some point, maybe you and elena could talk.I'm sure she'd like to hear"
5394,Alaric,Yeah.
5395,Jenna,Uh... Or not. No pressure.
5396,Alaric,I don't know if that's a--a great idea.at least not--not for a while.
5397,Damon,Where'd our girlfriend go?
5398,Stefan,"She's on her way to the grill.I, uh, wanted to talk to you.[He shows him the picture of Isobel]This is the woman, isobel,From north carolina. Remember her now?"
5399,Damon,Who wants to know?
5400,Stefan,I do.
5401,Damon,Who else wants to know?

5403,Damon,"Sorry. Don't know her.Hey, are you comin'?The real housewives of mystic falls await."
5404,Caroline,"He's already been hit on, like, 35 times.He's total cougar bait."
5405,Elena,Impressive.
5406,Matt,More like embarrassing
5407,Caroline,"Hi, mrs. Donovan."
5408,Kelly,"Elena, honey."
5409,Elena,"Hi, kelly."
5410,Kelly,"Long time, no see."
5411,Elena,How are you doing?
5412,Kelly,"Oh, same old.Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart."
5413,Matt,Mom.
5414,Kelly,"Just kidding. Calm down.He found his rebound girl.Oh.Here you go, sweetheart.However many that'll buy.[She gives money to Caroline]I just hope I don't get bachelor 3.I dated him in high school.Not impressive.in any way.[Caroline gives her tickets]Very exciting."
5415,Damon,"I've got the big date planned.It's a romantic dinner,Secluded spot somewhere woodsy."
5416,Carol,You're making me think I should buy a ticket.
5417,Damon,"Well, you are in charge.You could always rig it.[He sees Lizzie]Pardon me."
5418,Lizzie,I ran the check on the history teacher.You want this before or after your big debut?
5419,Damon,How's it look?
5420,Lizzie,"He checks out.Couple of speeding tickets.It's a rough story, though.Turns out his wife went missing A few years back in north carolina."

5423,Damon,Isobel.
5424,Carol,"And what do you do, bachelor number 3?"

5426,Carol,"Well, isn't that wonderful?We could always use more plumbers.Moving on.Number 4, ""alaric saltzman.""Wow. That's quite a mouthful.What do you do, alaric?"
5427,Alaric,I'm a teacher at mystic falls high.
5428,Carol,"Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.This one's a keeper. What do you teach?"
5429,Alaric,History.
5430,Carol,"History. Oh, well, give us a fun fact About mystic falls, something crazy."
5431,Alaric,"Uh, well..."
5432,Carol,"He probably saving the best stories for his date.And last, but not least, Damon salvatore.We don't have much on you."
5433,Damon,"Well, I'm tough to fit on a card."
5434,Carol,"Do you have any hobbies, like to travel?"
5435,Damon,"Oh, yeah. L.A., new york.Couple of years ago, I was in north carolina,Near the duke campus, actually.I think--I think alaric went to school there.Didn't you, rick?Yeah, 'cause I-- I know your wife did.I had a drink with her once.She was--she was a great girl.I ever tell you that? 'cause she was--She-- Delicious."
5436,Jenna,Are you ok?
5437,Elena,I just need some air.
5438,Stefan,Elena.
5439,Elena,He k*ll her?Damon was the vampire that k*ll her?
5440,Stefan,I don't know what happened.Alaric said that they never found the body.
5441,Elena,"Oh, my god. Stefan."
5442,Stefan,"I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,But I just-- I wanted to know more."
5443,Elena,"I was feeling sorry for him,Hoping that this whole katherine thing would change him.I'm so stupid."
5444,Stefan,"He doesn't know about the connection to you.I thought about confronting him,but he's already so on edge."
5445,Elena,Why are you protecting him?
5446,Stefan,Because you're not the only one hoping that he might actually change.
5447,Elena,That man.I saw that man outside of trudie's.
5448,Stefan,Get back inside. Come on.
5449,Carol,And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.
5450,Kelly,That's me.
5451,Carol,Ah. Kelly donovan. Lovely.You and the plumber should have so much fun.
5452,Caroline,"Congratulations, mrs. Donovan."
5453,Kelly,"Ok, just stop. Stop trying so hard.This thing you're doing, this nice thing, it's fake,Like you, like your mom,And for some reason, matt fell for it,But that doesn't mean that I will.I don't like you, ok?So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar."
5454,Caroline,Ok.
5455,Damon, Whoa. Easy there.Buy a ticket like everyone else.
5456,Elena,"Did you enjoy that,Rubbing it in to alaric saltzman?"
5457,Damon,What?
5458,Elena,Just as I was starting to think that there Was something redeemable about you.
5459,Stefan,Elena.
5460,Damon,Am I missing something here?
5461,Elena,"Did I forget to mention earlier when we were talking About my birth mother,The one that gave me up?Her name was isobel.Go ahead. Reminisce about how you k*ll her."
5462,Stefan,Come on. Let's get you home.
5463,Man,I have a message for you.
5464,Elena,What?
5465,Stefan,Who are you?
5466,Man,Stop looking.
5467,Elena,Stop looking for what?
5468,Man,She doesn't want to know you.She doesn't want to talk to you.
5469,Elena,Isobel?
5470,Man,You need to stop looking. Do you understand?
5471,Elena,She's alive? Does that mean she's a--
5472,Stefan,"Elena, he's under a compulsion."
5473,Man,Do you understand?
5474,Elena,Yes. I do.
5475,Man,Good.I'm done now.
5476,Stefan,Come on. Let's get out of here.
5477,Carol,37649.
5478,Jenna,That's me.
5479,Carol,"Congratulations.And bachelor number 5, damon salvatore.37552. Would you look at that. 37552.What are the chances? Me.Where'd he go?"
5480,Alaric,I'm gonna call you later.
5481,Alaric,"I think it's time to let this vampire crap go.I mean, the research, the trips,"
5482,Isobel,"Well, this is important to me, rick."
5483,Alaric,"Why? Why is it so important?Explain it to me. I mean, make me understand.I mean, what's the point of this?You don't want kids. You're barely ever home.I just want us to be normal people."
5484,Isobel,Maybe I don't want to.Maybe I want more.
5485,Matt,"Here we go. Home, sweet home."
5486,Kelly,Wait. Why--why are we back here?I wasn't ready to leave.
5487,Matt,"Yeah, you were, mom."
5488,Kelly,"You're the best, matty."
5489,Matt,I know.
5490,Kelly,I'm--I'm sorry... I was gone so long.
5491,Matt,"Why are you really home, mom?"
5492,Kelly,"It's pete. He's gone,And it's all my fault.I did it. I always do it."
5493,Matt,"No, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault."
5494,Kelly,You're all I have left.Please don't leave me.
5495,Matt,I'm not goin' anywhere.
5496,Damon,Are you really this stupid?Guess so [He hurts him]You gonna put down the stake?Wow. That's courage.
5497,Alaric,Where's isobel?What have you done to my wife?
5498,Damon,You want me to tell you I k*ll her?Would that make you happy?Because I think you know what happened.
5499,Alaric,I saw you feeding on her.
5500,Damon,"Yeah.I did, and I wasn't lying.She was delicious.[He baddly hurts Alaric]Oh, come on. What do you think happened?Not an inkling?Never considered the possibility?I turned her."
5501,Alaric,Why?
5502,Damon,"She came to me, all pathetic,Looking for vampires.There was something about her,Something I liked.There was something special."
5503,Alaric,You turned her because you liked her?
5504,Damon,"No, I slept with her because I liked her.I turned her because she begged me to.Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you?Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home,Wasn't happy with life in general,Wasn't happy with you.[He hurts him again]"
5505,Alaric,Gaah!
5506,Damon,"Ah, this is a shame.We're kindred spirits,abandoned by the women we love.Unrequited love sucks.Sounds like I got a lung.Which means I get to sit"
5507,Stefan,What happened? What did you do?
5508,Damon,"Dude, what? He attacked me."
5509,Stefan,Damon.
5510,Damon,All I did was tell him the truth.His wife didn't want him anymore.It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
5511,Stefan,Like you've been handling katherine?
5512,Damon,"I'm handling it fine. You know what?Isobel came to me. She found me.And if she's related to elena,That means she's related to katherine.Maybe katherine sent her to me."
5513,Stefan,Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
5514,Damon,Can't be a coincidence isobel sought me out.Can't. I'm assuming you'll take care of this.
5515,Alaric,What happened? What's going on?
5516,Stefan,You were just... Did damon turn you?
5517,Alaric,"No. I went for him, And then he stabbed me."
5518,Stefan,"No, no, no. You must have vampire bl*od in your system.Somebody slipped it to you."
5519,Alaric,No. It's... it's something else.
5520,Stefan,Then how?
5521,Alaric,I...Isobel.
5522,Alaric,Surprise gifts aren't fair.I always feel bad for not getting you something.
5523,Isobel,Just open
5524,Alaric,"Oh,that's a giant piece of jewelry."
5525,Isobel,I know. It's ridiculous.Just tell people it's a family heirloom Nobody questions that.
5526,Alaric,Where'd you get this?
5527,Isobel,"If I told you, you'd laugh at me.But promise me that you'll always wear it."
5528,Alaric,"A ring to ward off the demons, eh?"
5529,Isobel,"Consider it a-- a token of my love,My affection, and if nothing else,An apology for being so crazy."
5530,Alaric,"Well, you were definitely crazy."
5531,Isobel,"I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed,And I'm a horrible wife.But you love me anyway."
5532,Alaric,"Yes, I do."
5533,Alaric,This ring protected me.That's impossible.
5534,Alaric,I know.
5535,Woman,Was there a problem?Did you find her? What's going on?
5536,Elena,Isobel?
5537,Woman,Pearl.It's harper.
5538,Pearl,"I'm glad you found us.Ms. Gibbons, This gentleman is a friend of mine.May he come in?"
5539,Miss Gibbson,Any friend of pearl's is a friend of mine.Please do. Come in.
5540,Pearl,"Annabelle, close the door, please."
5541,Anna, Hey Beth-Anne
5542,Anna, what are you guys watching? You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time? There are over one hundred and fifty channels. It's called a remote control. This button changes the channel. Hold it like this.
5543,Miss gibbons, Did you get enough sweetheart? 
5544,Frederick, For now
5545,Miss Gibbons," Anna, are you hungry? Did you want a little?"
5546,Anna," No, thank you misses Gibbons. Why don't you lie down for a while and get some rest?"
5547,Frederick, She's fine. Aren't you Miss Gibbons? 
5548,Miss Gibbons, Off course I am. I'm fine.
5549,Matt, Hey mom! Mom?
5550,Matt, hey mom?
5551,Kelly, what? I'm trying to sleep.
5552,Matt, I was just making sure you're alive.
5553,Kelly, I'm sorry sweety. It was a late night. My head is throbbing 
5554,Matt, I would appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home. And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it too. 
5555,Kelly," it wasn't a party, it was one guy, don't be so judgy."
5556,Matt," well, I talked to Roberta at the grill and there's still a bartending position open if you want to … get a job."
5557,Kelly, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I went there.
5558,Matt, I think she's desperate.
5559,Kelly, I'll check it out.
5560,Matt, Yeah?
5561,Kelly, Don't look so surprise.
5562,Matt," Well, I mean… I didn't know how long you planned on staking around."
5563,Kelly," Well, there's background due"
5564,Matt, he's back everything mom.
5565,Kelly," Like I said, I'll check it out."
5566,Kelly, who's that?
5567,Matt, It's Caroline
5568,Matt, Easy
5569,Matt, Yeah come in!
5570,Caroline, Hello misses Donovan
5571,Matt," Hey, ok. Well we're going to be late. So let's get going."
5572,Caroline, yeah
5573,Matt, Hey
5574,Caroline, hey
5575,Matt, How are you?
5576,Caroline, Good
5577,Stefan, Damon hasn't said a word to me. Every time I try to talk to him he shuts me down
5578,Elena, Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
5579,Stefan, I don't know. He waited a hundred and forty five years only to find out that Katherine could not care less. And he's got hurt right?
5580,Elena, And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
5581,Stefan, You have every reason to be upset of him. Have you thought any more about what you're going to do?
5582,Elena," About what? Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine, who screwed over your vampire brother? Nah… I haven't thought about it at all"
5583,Stefan, I'm sorry I brought it up
5584,Elena, it'd just be nice if we could get through one day without having to deal with any of it. No vampire mother or brother
5585,Stefan, no vampires at all?
5586,Elena," no vampire, but you. I just want to get us back to normal stuff like school and homework and here the thought: fun"
5587,Stefan," ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?"
5588,Matt, We can watch a movie at my place
5589,Caroline, With your mom and a six pack?
5590,Matt, You know… you don't really help the situation. You could at least try to be nice
5591,Caroline, Oh… I'm sorry. It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me. I'm not that evolved.
5592,Caroline," So, a movie tonight?"
5593,Matt, Wherever you want to do it's good for me but I'm late and I got to go ok?
5594,Caroline, ok 
5595,Pearl, The keypad is for texting which is what to do when you want to avoid talking to someone
5596,Harper, I didn't break it I swear
5597,Pearl, I was just showing harper what you taught me. What a marvelous device!
5598,Harper, Who was that?
5599,Anna, Jeremy Gilbert
5600,Harper, Is that your boyfriend?
5601,Pearl, off course not
5602,Pearl, What do you think?
5603,Anna, Very respectable
5604,Pearl, That's the goal. I can't say that I miss corsets
5605,Anna, Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys and her credit card
5606,Pearl, what's that?
5607,Anna, I'll explain later
5608,Frederick, Where are you going?
5609,Pearl, We have some business in town. We'll be back as soon as we can. I trust that you'll keep an eye on things
5610,Frederick," So, I'm the baby sitter now?"
5611,Pearl," Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another"
5612,Frederick, So you saying
5613,Harper, I'll watch things miss Pearl 
5614,Pearl, Thank you Harper
5615,Caroline," I'm thinking nothing huge, just a dinner at the grill maybe a late movie"
5616,Stefan, You mean a double date?
5617,Caroline, Two pairs out on a Friday night coupled. Yeah a double date
5618,Elena, Do you think that's a good idea?
5619,Caroline, Why not? We all haven't gone out together before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us. Look the couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you Matt and me and I just think it's important that we get over it
5620,Elena, I don't know
5621,Stefan, I think that's sound like a great idea
5622,Elena, you do?
5623,Stefan," yeah. A nice evening out with friends. Sounds fun, like in ""fun"""
5624,Elena, A double date it is
5625,Caroline," ok. So, we will see you tonight"
5626,Elena, ok
5627,Pearl, Hello Damon
5628,Damon, Ever hear of knocking? 
5629,Pearl, An invitation wasn't necessary. I'm surprised that no living person resides here. Is it just you and your brother? 
5630,Anna, yeah. How do you keep out unwelcome vampires?
5631,Damon, I k*ll them
5632,Pearl, Have a sit Damon. I was hoping we could have a word
5633,Damon, Sure 
5634,Jeremy," ""How do you become a vampire?"""
5635,Talker," ""Brad Pitt changed me"""
5636,Talker," ""Go to Vegas ask for Wayne Newton"""
5637,Jeremy," ""How do you k*ll a vampire?"""
5638,Talker," ""The bl*od of Paula Abdul"""
5639,Jeremy," ""Serious answers only please"""
5640,Talker," ""Stake in the heart always works"""
5641,Jeremy," ""You're a believer?"" "
5642,Talker," ""Aren't you?"""
5643,Pearl, we've taken a residence at a farmhouse just outside the town. It'll suffice for now.
5644,Damon, All 25 vampires?
5645,Pearl," Not all, some. I imagine that a few have already left town. Others are probably still in the woods or like us acclimating."
5646,Damon, How did they get out of the tomb?
5647,Anna, I think the witches screwed up that part of the occus pocus
5648,Pearl, I understand from Anna that the founding families still have a secret council?
5649,Anna, And you're a part of it
5650,Damon, That's ridiculous
5651,Anna," I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon. I'm up to speed."
5652,Pearl," And so I'm I. And now that you've infiltrated the council, I need to know everything they know. Starting with a listing names of all the council members and their families"
5653,Anna, And everyone you've supplied with verveine
5654,Pearl, That will have to stop immediately
5655,Damon, What exactly are you trying to achieve?
5656,Pearl," Mystic Falls is our home, Damon. They took that from us. Our land, our home. It's time we rebuild"
5657,Damon," what, are you crazy? It was 1864. Wake up woman. The world has moved on"
5658,Pearl, As a reward for your help I'm willing to give you what you want most
5659,Damon, I want nothing
5660,Pearl, Katherine
5661,Damon, You won't even know where she was. You've been on the ground for the last century and a half
5662,Pearl," Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon. I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her"
5663,Damon, I no longer had any desire to see Katherine ever again. And there's no way in hell I'm gonna play the role of your little minion
5664,Pearl, I'm not asking for your help Damon. Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness. The rest in not negotiable
5665,Pearl," I have four hundred years on you, little boy. I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking and you know it. I'll be in touch."
5666,Elena, You got me flowers
5667,Stefan," I figured it's a date, I wanted to do things right. I would have driven too but you're the one with the car "
5668,Elena," You know, you think that for someone who was around when the car was invented you should have one"
5669,Stefan," oh, I have one. I just never drive it"
5670,Elena," You know, it's not too late to cancel"
5671,Stefan, Why we would do that?
5672,Elena," I don't know, it just seems surreal. Like we weren't meant to get to the normal part"
5673,Stefan," That's exactly why we're going to do it. We're going to go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious. Listen, when I decided to stay here and get to know you, it so that I could do things like this. Bring my girlfriend flowers, to go out on a date, and try to be normal"
5674,Elena," ""Have you ever even been on a double date before?"""
5675,Stefan," Oh, absolutely. '72, Hef and the twins."
5676,Elena, What?
5677,Stefan, Yeah... playmates. I got Miss June.
5678,Elena, Are you serious?
5679,Pearl, Miss Sommers?
5680,Jenna, Yes. Hi Pearl
5681,Pearl, Hi. This is my Daughter Annabelle
5682,Jenna," Of course, Jeremy's friend"
5683,Anna, Nice to see you Miss Sommers
5684,Jenna," oh, Jenna, please. This property was in my brother in law's family for generations. It's one of the originals structure in Mystic Falls. It used to be one of those old fashioned drugstore"
5685,Pearl, An apothecary? 
5686,Jenna, Yeah
5687,Pearl, You don't say
5688,Jenna, Sorry if it's a little musty
5689,Jenna, No one has been here for months
5690,Pearl, I'll use my imagination
5691,Pearl, Annabelle?
5692,Anna, I'm coming mother
5693,Kelly, What's with the glasses inside?
5694,Damon, My eyes were a little sensible today 
5695,Kelly, You're new around here
5696,Damon," On the contrary, I'm very old"
5697,Damon," Bourbon, neat"
5698,Kelly, I haven't been gone that long. I would remember someone who looks like you 
5699,Damon, Yeah. Where did you go?
5700,Kelly," Around, about"
5701,Damon, I've been there
5702,Kelly, I love to see a man drawn his sorrows. It's so sexy
5703,Damon, It's more like nursing my wounds. And you?
5704,Kelly, I was supposed interviewing for the bartender job but I think the manager blew me off
5705,Damon," Well, that's not very nice"
5706,Kelly, Yeah. Last time I was in town I slept with her boyfriend
5707,Damon, That's not very nice either
5708,Kelly, It happens
5709,Damon, Yes it does
5710,Jenna, Kelly? Kelly Donovan
5711,Kelly, Jenna!
5712,Jenna, I heard you were back in town. (To Damon) She used to Babysits me
5713,Kelly, And then I used to party with her
5714,Jenna, This woman is crazy
5715,Kelly, Not as crazy as you
5716,Jenna, I'm not anymore
5717,Kelly," Well sit, drink!"
5718,Jenna, I shouldn't. I'm responsible now. Haven't you heard?
5719,Kelly," Well, take a night off its good for the soul"
5720,Damon, Great for the soul
5721,Jenna, This is not going to end well
5722,Damon, Can't wait
5723,Frederick, I hate this house
5724,Beth-Anne, It's better than the tomb
5725,Frederick, I didn't stay locked for a hundred and forty five years to end up locked here
5726,Harper, Maybe you should quit complaining
5727,Frederick, You're going to stop me? 
5728,Beth-Anne, Let it be Frederick. You heard what Pearl said
5729,Frederick, I don't care what Pearl said. (To Harper) What you got boy?
5730,Frederick, Try it again
5731,Pearl, Back off. We don't fight each other. There are other rules
5732,Frederick, And I'm tired of your rules. I want to go out of this house. Why can't we go out on the town?
5733,Pearl, Eventually. But for now we have to keep a low profile.
5734,Frederick, No one knows who I am
5735,Pearl, The Salvatore's brothers do
5736,Frederick, And I wish to hell that I can run into them. There are the reason we were caught in the first place
5737,Elena," So, Matt, How do you like working here?"
5738,Matt, It's not that bad. Wait staff is pretty good and they can't keep a bartender to save their lives. I actually put my mom off to a job.
5739,Elena, How it has been? Having Kelly back?
5740,Matt," You know, same old Kelly. She's trying, sort of."
5741,Elena," Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up. That's how Matt and I first met, we shared a crib together"
5742,Stefan, You're kidding?
5743,Matt," No, we have known each other our all lives"
5744,Matt, You got to be kidding me
5745,Harper, Where are you going?
5746,Frederick," Beth-Anne and I are going out for a bit. Hit the town, kick up our heels"
5747,Harper, We're not supposed to leave. Miss Pearl made that very clear
5748,Frederick, You're going to stop me? I didn't think so
5749,Jeremy, Anna?
5750,Anna, surprised?
5751,Jeremy, I thought you and your mom were leaving town
5752,Anna," Change of plans. Sorry, I thought you'd be psyched"
5753,Jeremy," No, no, no. I mean… I am. Of course I am"
5754,Anna," Alright then, step aside"
5755,Jenna, Don't be grumpy. It can't be that bad.
5756,Damon," You'd be surprised. My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shakey ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom. Let's get hammered."
5757,Kelly, Lets
5758,Caroline, At least they're having fun
5759,Elena, They're drunk
5760,Matt, Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after the homecoming?
5761,Caroline (laughing), Oh my god yes!
5762,Elena," Well, we were wasted; there was the first time I ever got drunk. I blame Matt"
5763,Matt, her parents got seats at the next booth
5764,Elena, And Matt and I were pretended that I was choking so we can get away
5765,Matt, Except that her dad was a doctor so he jumped out to save her
5766,Elena," And I ran, slipped on the wet floor and b*at it in front of everyone. Do you remember that? 3 stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one (She looks at matt) for a week"
5767,Caroline, I'm gonna go to the restroom. Elena?
5768,Jenna, Hide. We're not here.
5769,Kelly, Why? Where'd we go?
5770,Jenna, Children under our care. Five o'clock. This is not good
5771,Kelly, Damn!
5772,Jeremy, What made you and your mom decide to stay in town?
5773,Anna," She got this business opportunity; she's going to open up a little store. It has always been her dream. So yeah we're staying. And I'm thinking to going back to high school, so you'll be seeing a little more of me."
5774,Jeremy, Yeah?
5775,Anna," Enough of homeschooling. I'd like to be a normal teen for once. But I have to ask my mom first, she'll have an opinion"
5776,Jeremy," well, I wish you were there now. I actually have to write another paper. I was thinking about squeezing one more add on ""the vampire in Mystic Falls""."
5777,Anna, Really? Haven't you exhausted the subject?
5778,Jeremy," No, I want to go deeper you know. I want to understand why people reliable those vampires back in the day. I mean, maybe there's such a thing has vampires, they're just different from the way we always thought they were."
5779,Anna, what do you mean? 
5780,Jeremy," Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders you know? Um, misunderstood."
5781,Anna, You're kidding right?
5782,Jeremy, Don't you think it could be possible? You did give me all that info
5783,Anna," Jeremy, I made it up ok? You were cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression"
5784,Matt, Is there anything you're not good at?
5785,Stefan, Double dating. This is all kind of new to me. I usually keep to myself. I don't always fit in.
5786,Matt, That's because you're that guy
5787,Stefan, What guy?
5788,Matt," The guy who seems like he has everything, so the people that don't, kind of run the other way"
5789,Stefan, Is that what I seem like?
5790,Matt, Pretty much
5791,Stefan, Hmm... What a dick!
5792,Caroline," So hum, what are you doing?"
5793,Elena, What?
5794,Caroline, Well the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan. You don't have to talk about your past
5795,Elena, I was just trying to make conversation
5796,Caroline, Try less
5797,Frederick, Katherine?
5798,Elena," I'm sorry, you have the wrong person"
5799,Caroline," Elena, come on!"
5800,Frederick, My mistake
5801,Elena, How's everything going?
5802,Stefan, Matt's cheating
5803,Matt," No need, I'm awesome"
5804,Frederick (watching them), Stefan Salvatore
5805,Stefan (to Elena), Everything's okay?
5806,Elena, Everything's great
5807,Elena," ""That man over there just called me Katherine"" "
5808,Stefan," So, you didn't recognize, you haven't seen him before? "
5809,Elena," No, there was nothing familiar about him at all"
5810,Stefan," Right, let's cut off the night. Ok? Sent Matt and Caroline home?"
5811,Elena," No, the whole point of the night was to not have to deal with this stuff. We need to get through one night. One normal night."
5812,Stefan, You're sure?
5813,Elena," No I'm not sure, but I don't know what else to do. Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow. We'll deal with it tomorrow"
5814,Stefan, Ok
5815,Stefan, It's them. Come here
5816,Caroline, This is much better than watching Damon visit cougar town. (To Matt) No offence
5817,Matt, Don't remind me. (To Stefan): Men I've always wanted to see how it looks like in this place
5818,Stefan," Yeah, it's uh… a little bit too much"
5819,Matt," Yeah, my entire house could fit in it like twice"
5820,Caroline, It's like I've been here before. It's weird
5821,Elena, Do you guys want to watch a movie or something?
5822,Matt, Whoa; these are great!
5823,Stefan, This is uh… a little hobby of mine
5824,Matt, I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9
5825,Stefan, You like cars?
5826,Matt, It's an understatement
5827,Stefan, Come with me
5828,Damon," So, the thing about cherries, you have to… "
5829,Damon, Oh my goodness
5830,Damon," That's amazing, you were fast"
5831,Jenna, That would be my queue
5832,Kelly (looking at Damon), You're given up already?
5833,Jenna, Oh yeah
5834,Jenna, See you guys 
5835,Stefan, Prepare yourself my friend
5836,Matt," Wait, how do you have this?"
5837,Stefan, She was passed down through the family 
5838,Matt, Why don't you… I mean… Why don't you drive it?
5839,Stefan," Well, it doesn't run. I mean, it's not that I could figure out "
5840,Caroline, Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
5841,Matt, Be more of a girl right now
5842,Stefan (to Matt)," Hey, want to come take a look at this for me?"
5843,Matt," Elena, remember the old Camaro you're dad used to have?"
5844,Elena, Of course
5845,Matt, I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times
5846,Stefan, wow
5847,Caroline, I don't like sports cars; they're too hard to make out in
5848,Matt (looking at Elena), It wasn't that bad
5849,Matt (to Stefan), I'm sorry men
5850,Stefan," No, no, no. Don't worry about it. You and Elena, you guys have an history and ignore it doesn't do anybody any good "
5851,Matt, She's good with you. You know I wasn't sure but she's happy and I'm glad
5852,Matt," Alright, just take a look at this"
5853,Frederick, Need some help?
5854,Jenna, Damn it! Stupid shoe
5855,Frederick, I'll pick up the other foot
5856,Jenna," Thanks, I think"
5857,Frederick, Was it Damon Salvatore you were with?
5858,Jenna, The one and only. You know him?
5859,Frederick, we go way back. He still lives at Miller Lane? 
5860,Jenna, He lives in the old boarding house by Wickery Bridge. He's still in there if you want to say hi
5861,Frederick, I prefer to stay here and talk to you
5862,Jenna," Oh, nice. Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt. But, I'm a little drunk and a guy plus drunk me equals very bad things"
5863,Frederick, I'm pretty sure you'd like it
5864,Jenna, Sorry. This was a seriously lame pick up.
5865,Frederick, This is a nice scent you wear. What is it?
5866,Jenna, I don't know (she laughs) it was a gift. And that is a cab so…
5867,Frederick, Vervain... making it hard to find something to eat in this town 
5868,Elena, Caroline…
5869,Caroline, I don't want to talk about it
5870,Elena, You're being ridiculous 
5871,Caroline, And insecure and stupid. But that doesn't change the fact that Matt's always gonna be in love with you and I'm always gonna be the back up
5872,Elena, You're not the back up
5873,Caroline, Yes I'm. I'm Matt's Elena back up; I'm your Bonnie back up
5874,Elena, Now it's about me and Bonnie?
5875,Caroline, You don't get it. Why would you? You're everyone's first choice
5876,Matt, Piece of cake! 
5877,Stefan, You know what? Why don't you guys go ahead and take a first spin?
5878,Matt, Really?
5879,Stefan, Yeah
5880,Stefan, You're alright?
5881,Elena, If it's not vampires its girlfriends
5882,Jeremy," alright. Rosbief, turkey, what do you want?"
5883,Anna, Let's do the works. Pile at high
5884,Jeremy," Ok, I like your style. Would you get the bread for me?"
5885,Anna, ok
5886,Anna, What are you doing?
5887,Jeremy, It's just a cut. Can you bring me that towel?
5888,Anna, I can't
5889,Jeremy, You have a problem with bl*od Anna?
5890,Jeremy, What's the matter? It's just bl*od Anna
5891,Anna, What are you doing?
5892,Jeremy, I knew it. (He shows her his hand) go for it
5893,Jeremy," Jenna! Hey, what's up?"
5894,Jenna, Regrets. Make sure you lock that up
5895,Matt, Did I pass the driveway?
5896,Caroline, Uh… I think it's up there
5897,Matt, This is an amazing car. Did I pass?
5898,Matt, The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I do around Elena
5899,Caroline, I don't know. You were reminiscing about the Elena years the whole night so…
5900,Matt, Caroline that has come before. That cannot just go away 
5901,Caroline, I know that okay?
5902,Matt," No you don't. Because, Elena turns you in a crazy person. Look it's my fault. I made it pretty clear earlier that Elena still means something to me. But all that talk, that was just two old friends with some memories. Tonight wasn't about me and Elena. I was there because I wanted to be with you. And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you are the only person I want to be in this car with right know. And I don't know if that makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself"
5903,Caroline," No, no. I think you're doing just fine"
5904,Caroline, Sports cars…
5905,Kelly, Know that you've brought me here. (She drinks) What are you gonna do with me?
5906,Damon, I'm going to… going to do this
5907,Matt, Mom?!
5908,Caroline, Damon?!
5909,Kelly, Oh my god matt! Oh my god
5910,Matt, I got to…
5911,Caroline," It's fine, just go"
5912,Elena (to Matt), I'll take her home
5913,Pearl, Where have you been?
5914,Anna, I needed some air
5915,Pear," For Three hours? Tell me, where have you been?"
5916,Anna," Out, I was out"
5917,Pearl," Annabelle, don't do this. I can't fight you too. What?"
5918,Anna, I'm sorry
5919,Elena, Sorry I'm bailing
5920,Stefan, Just wish you let me drive you home
5921,Elena," Normal people don't have chaperons, bodyguards or baby-sitters. We're normal tonight remember?"
5922,Stefan," I know, I just get so worry about you"
5923,Elena," Stefan, I can't live every minute afraid that someone is gonna come after me. I won't, it's not living"
5924,Stefan, Okay. Call me when you get home safe
5925,Caroline, By Stefan
5926,Damon, Don't look at me like that
5927,Stefan, Are you crazy?
5928,Damon, Save the lecture. Look…
5929,Stefan, I remember them from 1864. They were in the tomb.
5930,Damon, Yeah... About that. 
5931,Kelly, Matt…
5932,Matt, I don't want to hear it mom
5933,Kelly, Matty please…
5934,Matt," Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom? I was having fun, you know, trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day. Just enjoying a night with my friends. And then, there you are, wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way, to pay the bills that you don't pay. And then you're off acting like a freakin' kid, hooking up with some guy half your age. I'm the kid, Mom. You're supposed to be responsible for me."
5935,Kelly, I know Matt
5936,Elena, How was your night?
5937,Jeremy, Ah... Same old. Same old... You?
5938,Elena, Yep 
5939,Pearl," So, where is Beth-Anne?"
5940,Frederick, She won't be coming back 
5941,Pearl, What happened? Where is she?
5942,Frederick," Well, you were right.(He looks at Anna) We shouldn't have left "
5943,Pearl, No. Hungry?
5944,Pearl, Next time you'll listen to me. 
5945,Elena," I'm home, teeth brushed, and ready for bed. Save and sour"
5946,Stefan, Good good. I'm glad
5947,Elena, Is everything alright? You sound serious
5948,Stefan," No, no, no. Not tonight, you still have a few minutes left in normal. I'll tell you tomorrow okay? "
5949,Elena, I had a really nice time in our date tonight
5950,Stefan, Such a liar
5951,Elena," No, I'm serious. In a way it was exactly how it was supposed to be"
5952,Stefan, I had a really nice time too
5953,Damon (to Stefan), Could you help me out a little bit?
5954,Jeremy, What the hell?
5955,Anna, I could have k*ll you!
5956,Jeremy," Yeah, but you didn't"
5957,Anna, I should have
5958,Jeremy, But you didn't
5959,Anna, How did you know?
5960,Jeremy," I knew this girl. Vicki. She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck. She started acting crazy, weird, and it seemed like drugs, but then you showed me those articles. And then I saw your face and how it changed the night in the cemetery when I kissed you."
5961,Anna," You know you can't tell anyone, right?"
5962,Jeremy, Who would believe me?
5963,Anna, You'd be surprised
5964,Jeremy, Why didn't you k*ll me?
5965,Anna, I don't know. Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you
5966,Jeremy, Like what?
5967,Anna, Lost. Why would you confront me about it? Why would you risk it?
5968,Jeremy," Because if it was true, maybe it's true about Vicki. And also because I want you to turn me."
5969,STEFAN," For over a century, I have lived in secret until now. I know the risk. But I have to know her."
5970,DAMON," There's a tomb underneath the church. A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her. I'm gonna bring her back."
5971,DAMON, She's not there!
5972,STEFAN, You saved everyone in the church?
5973,PEARL, We've taken up residence in a farmhouse just outside of town.
5974,DAMON, All 25 vampires?
5975,PEARL, Some.
5976,FREDERICK, I hate this house. I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
5977,PEARL," So, where's Bethanne?"
5978,FREDERICK, She won't be coming back.
5979,ALARIC, My wife Isobel spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area. What have you done to my wife?
5980,DAMON, I turned her.
5981,JEREMY, Maybe there is such a thing as vampires. They're just different from the way we always thought they were.
5982,JEREMY," Aah! You got a problem with bl*od, Anna? Ahh!"
5983,JEREMY," I knew this girl Vicki. She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck. And then I saw your face."
5984,ANNA, Why would you confront me about it?
5985,JEREMY, Because maybe it's true about Vicki. And also because I want you to turn me.
5986,ANNA, I love storms.
5987,JEREMY, Is that a vampire thing? 'cause I read vampires don't like running water.
5988,ANNA, It's only Dracula. Yeah. He was a complete wuss. Never showered. Very smelly.
5989,JEREMY, Seriously?
5990,ANNA," First rule about vampires, don't believe anything you read."
5991,JEREMY, You gotta tell me more. I gotta know.
5992,ANNA," No, you don't. 'cause you're not gonna be one."
5993,JEREMY," Come on, you can't keep saying ""no"" To me."
5994,ANNA," Look, I'm not gonna turn someone who learned everything he knows about vampires from Netflix."
5995,JEREMY," That's not true, and you know it."
5996,ANNA, Why do you even want this? Give me one good reason.
5997,JEREMY, 'cause I...
5998,ANNA, Hmm. Let me know when you can finish that sentence.
5999,ELENA," Hey, you're still up."
6000,JEREMY," Hey, what's up?"
6001,ELENA, Looks like the there's a big storm rolling in. Can you help make sure all the windows are closed?
6002,JEREMY, Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
6003,FREDERICK, We're running low on bl*od. You might wanna send Anna to the hospital for some more.
6004,PEARL, I'll send her out for some tomorrow.
6005,FREDERICK," Maybe I could go with her. If the storm keeps it dark enough, I might be able to go out during the day, no sun and all."
6006,PEARL, I'm afraid not. Not after your stunt at the Salvatore house tonight.
6007,FREDERICK, He and his brother deserved it.
6008,PEARL, And where did that get you? Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead. And you have no one to blame but yourself. We cannot live our lives about revenge. We have to have better control of our emotions.
6009,FREDERICK," I understand, miss Pearl. I just wish I knew what you were up to."
6010,PEARL," I'm going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't. Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much. It's still the Lockwoods, the Forbes, the Fells..."
6011,FREDERICK, We should k*ll every last one of them.
6012,PEARL," We are smarter than that, Frederick. These people are not our enemies. We don't hold grudges and resentments. We'll get our town back. We just have to have patience."
6013,FREDERICK," You heard her. No revenge. Patience. Self-control. She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she?"
6014,DAMON," I say we go to Pearl's, bust down the door, and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night."
6015,STEFAN," Yeah. And then what? We turn to the rest of that house of vampires and say, ""Oops. Sorry?"""
6016,ELENA, I can't believe you made a deal with her.
6017,DAMON," It was more like a helpful exchange of information. And it's not like a choice. She's... scary. Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back."
6018,ELENA," Of course she is. Damon gets what he wants, as usual. No matter who he hurts in the process."
6019,DAMON, You don't have to be snarky about it.
6020,ELENA, I woke up this morning to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb. I've earned snarky.
6021,DAMON, How long are you going to blame me for turning your birth mother into a vampire?
6022,ELENA," I'm not blaming you, Damon. I've accepted the fact that you're a self-serving psychopath with no redeeming qualities."
6023,DAMON, Ouch.
6024,STEFAN, This isn't being very productive. We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah? Hmm.
6025,ELENA, I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky.
6026,STEFAN, I know. He makes everybody cranky.
6027,ELENA," So, what are we going to do?"
6028,STEFAN," Damon and I are gonna handle everything, I promise."
6029,ELENA," Well, what about me? I can't just sit here and do nothing."
6030,STEFAN," That's exactly what you're gonna do, because that's what going to keep you safe."
6031,ELENA," Which means nothing if you're not safe, too."
6032,STEFAN," What do you mean? I'm perfectly safe. I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath on my side."
6033,ELENA," Well, that's comforting."
6034,ANNA, Ok. We have some time. I'm not meeting my mom until later.
6035,JEREMY, Wait. Does your mom know you're a...
6036,ANNA, The fact that you would even think it's possible to keep something like that a secret from your own family is just further proof that you're not ready.
6037,JEREMY," ""Not ready"" Is a step up from ""No."""
6038,ANNA," And a million steps down from ""Maybe."" I like your bracelet."
6039,JEREMY, Thanks. My sister got it for me.
6040,ANNA, Can I see it?
6041,JEREMY, Yeah. Yeah.
6042,ANNA," Your sister doesn't know you're hanging out with me, does she?"
6043,JEREMY, No. No. But I don't see why it would be a problem. It's not like she knows what you are.
6044,ANNA, I'd rather keep it our little secret.
6045,JEREMY," You know, why don't you...why don't you keep this?"
6046,ANNA, Why would you give this to me?
6047,JEREMY, Because. You like it. And I like you.
6048,ANNA, You only like me because of what you want from me.
6049,JEREMY, No. I...I like you.
6050,ANNA," Um... You know, you should wear it. It looks better on you anyway."
6051,MATT," I yelled at my mom last night. You know, I feel like the parent and the screwed-up kid."
6052,CAROLINE, Maybe she needed to hear it.
6053,MATT," Yeah, but just... I worry that if I push too hard, then she will take off again. 'cause that's her M.O. Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left."
6054,CAROLINE," Well, you can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can"
6055,MATT," I wish that she would just try a little. You know? If she would just try to try, that'd be ok."
6056,CAROLINE, Maybe she'll surprise you. People have a tendency to do that. I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.
6057,MATT, Yeah. Are you sure you should be driving right now?
6058,CAROLINE, I have to. It's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday. We have a non-traditional traditional ritual.
6059,MATT," Well, buckle up. Don't speed. Stay off your cell phone. And call me when you get there."
6060,CAROLINE, Got it. Anything else?
6061,MATT, Yes.
6062,CAROLINE, Bye.
6063,MATT, Bye.
6064,DAMON, Hunting party?
6065,STEFAN, That guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me. I gotta get my strength back up.
6066,DAMON, I've got 2 liters of soccer mom in the fridge. No?
6067,STEFAN, We'll talk when I get back?
6068,DAMON, All right. Give my regards to the squirrels.
6069,STEFAN, Aah!
6070,DAMON, You're ignoring me
6071,ELENA, The 6 missed calls? Sorry. My phone is dead.
6072,DAMON, Is Stefan here?
6073,ELENA, No. Why? Something wrong?
6074,DAMON, He went out to the woods and didn't come back. I can't get him on his phone. I figured he was here with you.
6075,ELENA, It's going straight to voice-mail. Where could he be?
6076,DAMON, You're not going to like what I'm thinking.
6077,DAMON, Pearl! Open this door. I swear to God I'll bust through and rip your head off.
6078,FREDERICK, Pearl's not home. Hmm. Beautiful weather. Not a ray of sun in the sky.
6079,DAMON, Where's my brother?
6080,FREDERICK, Billy.
6081,DAMON, You're dead.
6082,FREDERICK, Whoa. I'm sorry. You haven't been invited in. Miss Gibbons?
6083,GIBBONS," Yes, Frederick honey?"
6084,FREDERICK, Never let this bad man in.
6085,GIBBONS, I'll never let him in.
6086,STEFAN, Ugh!
6087,FREDERICK," 145 years left starving in a tomb, thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother. First few weeks, every single nerve in your body screams with fire. The kind of pain that can drive a person mad. Well... I thought your brother might've wanted to get a taste of that before I k*ll him. Billy."
6088,STEFAN, Uhh! Aah!
6089,FREDERICK, You have a nice day.
6090,ELENA, What happened? Where is he?
6091,DAMON, They have him. I can't get in.
6092,ELENA, Why not?
6093,DAMON, Because the woman that owns the house is compelled to not let me in.
6094,ELENA, I can get in.
6095,DAMON, You're not going in there.
6096,ELENA, I'm going!
6097,DAMON, You're not going there.
6098,ELENA, Why are they doing this? What do they want with him?
6099,DAMON, Revenge. They want revenge.
6100,ELENA, We gotta do something.
6101,DAMON, I know.
6102,ELENA, We can't let them hurt him. We gotta get him out of there.
6103,DAMON," I know. Elena, I know. But I don't know how to get him out."
6104,FREDERICK, Vervain on the ropes.
6105,STEFAN, Aah! Unh!
6106,FREDERICK, That's gotta sting. Speaking of...
6107,STEFAN, Aah!
6108,HARPER, This isn't right!
6109,FREDERICK," He k*ll Bethanne. One of us, Harper. And don't you think for a second he wouldn't k*ll you if he had the chance. Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right? I say that's exactly what we're here for. Starting with this."
6110,STEFAN, Aah! Aah!
6111,FREDERICK, And then his brother. And anyone else that gets in our way.
6112,HARPER, This isn't right!
6113,FREDERICK, You're gonna want to let go of me!
6114,HARPER, Miss Pearl will be home soon.
6115,FREDERICK, Miss Pearl is no longer in charge. Tie him up! And then stake him down.
6116,DAMON," Well, don't you look... alive?"
6117,ALARIC, You can't hurt me.
6118,DAMON," Oh, I can hurt you, all right."
6119,ELENA, Mr. Saltzman. We need your help.
6120,ELENA," Stefan's in the house. Damon's a vampire. He can't get in. We need you. I would go, but..."
6121,DAMON," Your life is valuable. Yours, on the other hand..."
6122,ELENA, Stefan told me about your ring.
6123,ALARIC, What about it?
6124,DAMON," Let me recap...You tried to k*ll me. I defended myself. You died. Then according to my brother, your ring brought you back to life. Am I leaving anything out?"
6125,ALARIC," Yeah. The part where I try and k*ll you again. Only this time, I don't miss."
6126,ELENA, Mr. Saltzman. Please. It's Stefan.
6127,ALARIC," I'm sorry, Elena. But it's not my problem."
6128,DAMON, That's a shame. Because the woman in charge of the crowd can help you find your wife.
6129,ALARIC, You're lying.
6130,DAMON," Am I? Why don't you ask her yourself? Coward. Come on, Elena."
6131,ALARIC, All right! Wait. I'll go.
6132,JEREMY," So, I have an answer."
6133,ANNA, To what?
6134,JEREMY, Why you should turn me.
6135,ANNA, We're back to that?
6136,JEREMY," Look, I wake up every day, and I feel ok, but there's something missing. Like a...like a hole. Some people, they fit... in life, or whatever. I... I don't."
6137,ANNA," So, you want a pity-turn? I don't think so."
6138,JEREMY, You should turn me because I don't have anything else.
6139,ANNA," Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood. Ok? One--we need someone to do our dirty work. Two, revenge. Three, boredom... but, you know, that never turns out well. And then you know there's the obvious one. You love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all of eternity with them. Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet."
6140,ANNA," So, yeah. Just make sure your thesis is clear, and she'll love it. See you later."
6141,ANNA," Mom, hey."
6142,PEARL, Did you get everything?
6143,ANNA," Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed because of the rain. I was in and out."
6144,PEARL, Who's that you were talking to?
6145,ANNA, A friend from the library.
6146,PEARL, Let's get home.
6147,M. LOCKWOOD," Hey, you're not going out in that, are ya? The roads are dangerous. Route 5 is completely flooded."
6148,PEARL, We'll make do.
6149,WAITRESS," Mayor Lockwood, we have your table ready."
6150,TYLER, Great.
6151,PEARL," Mayor... Lockwood, is it? I suppose it is treacherous outside. My name is Pearl."
6152,M. LOOKWOOD, Hi.
6153,PEARL, This is my daughter Anna. We've just recently moved to town.
6154,M. LOOKWOOD," Welcome. Richard Lockwood. This is my son Tyler. Please--please, join us."
6155,PEARL, It would be a pleasure.
6156,TYLER," Be more creepy, dad. Not like your son is standing right here."
6157,M. LOOKWOOD," Grow up. Elections are coming. She's a constituent. And a rich one, from the looks of it."
6158,TYLER, You can tell all that by looking at her ass? Awesome. I'm gonna go sh**t some pool.
6159,DAMON," Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night."
6160,ALARIC, I've you to thank for that.
6161,ELENA, What are these?
6162,ALARIC, Those are tranquilizer darts filled with vervain.
6163,DAMON, Just get me in. I'll get Stefan out.
6164,ELENA, That's your plan? You're just gonna take them all on yourself?
6165,DAMON," Well, I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully."
6166,ALARIC, Whoa. What are you doing?
6167,ELENA, I'm going with you guys.
6168,DAMON, No. No. No. No. No way.
6169,ELENA," You need me. I'll get in. You could distract them, and then I'll get Stefan out."
6170,DAMON, You'll get yourself k*ll. You're not going in there.
6171,ELENA, I'm going.
6172,DAMON," So, when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can. I know how to sneak around where they can't hear me. You'll basically just be in the way."
6173,ELENA," Damon, now is not the time to be the lone ranger."
6174,DAMON," Fine. Elena, you can drive the getaway car. You're not going in the house."
6175,ELENA, You can't stop me. It's Stefan we're talking about here. You don't understand.
6176,DAMON," Oh, I understand. I understand. He's the reason you live. His love lifts you up where you belong. I get it."
6177,ELENA, Can you just not joke around for 2 seconds?
6178,DAMON," I can't protect you, Elena. I don't know how many vampires there are in there. That's how long it takes you to get your head ripped off. I have to be able to get in and get out. I can't be distracted with your safety. Or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from...Including Stefan. I know. I get it. I understand."
6179,ALARIC," If we're gonna go, let's go."
6180,MATT, Where are you? I can barely hear you.
6181,CAROLINE, Storm washed out Route 5. Now I'm detoured on some random backwoods path to hell.
6182,MATT," Well, you shouldn't be talking while you're driving."
6183,CAROLINE," I know, right? I need one of those bluetooth thingies."
6184,MATT," Look, you're breaking up. Just turn around and go back the same way you came. And watch the road. Ok?"
6185,CAROLINE, Ok.
6186,CAROLINE, God. Ohh. Ohh. Seriously.
6187,ALARIC," Oh, good, someone's home. Uh, could I use your phone? My car broke down a few miles up the road. This was the first house I saw."
6188,FREDERICK," Well, lucky you."
6189,ALARIC," Yeah. Lucky me. It's no trouble, is it?"
6190,FREDERICK, Not the slightest.
6191,ALARIC, Great. Whew.
6192,ALARIC," Hey, man, I really appreciate it. It's rough out there."
6193,FREDERICK," Billy, show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen. And get me something to drink."
6194,BILLY, Yeah. Sure thing.
6195,BILLY," Hey, miss Gibbons, this guy wants to use your phone."
6196,MLLE GIBBONS," Oh, sure, honey. It's right there."
6197,ALARIC, Thanks.
6198,BILLY, Aah!
6199,MLLE GIBBONS, What's happening?
6200,ALARIC, I'm really sorry. But you're gonna need to invite a friend of mine inside.
6201,MLLE GIBBONS," Oh, I'm sorry. He's not allowed in the house."
6202,ALARIC, I know that. But you gotta make an exception.
6203,DAMON," Get her out of the house. Now! Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth. Are you married?"
6204,MLLE GIBBONS, No.
6205,DAMON," Parents, children, anyone else who lives on this property?"
6206,MLLE GIBBONS, No. It's just me.
6207,DAMON, Good.
6208,ALARIC, You were supposed to compel her.
6209,DAMON, It doesn't work that way...
6210,ALARIC, She is human.
6211,DAMON," And I'm not! So, I don't care. Now, get out of here. And get rid of the body!"
6212,PEARL, I'm in the process of obtaining some property. I understand that your family is the largest property owner in town.
6213,RICHARD," Well, yes we are. Dating all the way back to the town's original charter."
6214,PEARL, Your family came into a lot of new property in 1864.
6215,RICHARD, You know your history.
6216,PEARL, It's a passion of mine.
6217,TYLER, Guy's not even subtle about it.
6218,MATT, Who is that?
6219,TYLER, It's not my mother.
6220,PEARL," I'm sorry, Mayor. Do you know that boy over there?"
6221,RICHARD, Yeah it's Jeremy Gilbert.
6222,PEARL, You don't say.
6223,FREDERICK," Billy, what's the holdup?!"
6224,JACOB, Aah!
6225,ALARIC," Damn it, Elena!"
6226,FREDERICK," Billy, Jacob, get back in here!"
6227,DAMON, Are you insane?
6228,CAROLINE, Aah! Aah!
6229,PEARL, Jeremy Gilbert? Is that what you've been up to?
6230,ANNA, He's my friend. What's the big deal?
6231,PEARL, His family is the reason I was stuck in a tomb for over a century.
6232,ANNA, That doesn't mean he'll make the same choices.
6233,PEARL, I want you to stop seeing him.
6234,ANNA," I've been on my own for a long time, mother. I can make my own decisions."
6235,PEARL," Then stop acting like a child! As soon as Jeremy finds out what you really are, he will turn on..."
6236,ANNA, He already knows.
6237,PEARL, What did you just say?
6238,ANNA, Jeremy knows.
6239,ANNA, He likes it. And he likes me.
6240,STEFAN, Uhh. Thank you. For trying to help me.
6241,TREVOR, They just needed somebody to blame. Someone to punish.
6242,STEFAN, Elena...You shouldn't be here...
6243,DAMON, She was supposed to stay in the car.
6244,STEFAN, Unh! No. No. No. Not him.
6245,DAMON, Whatever. Let's get you down.
6246,STEFAN, There's vervain on the ropes.
6247,DAMON," Elena, pull that."
6248,STEFAN, Unh!
6249,DAMON," All right, let's go. Clothes on."
6250,STEFAN, Wait.
6251,DAMON," What? Guys, come on. We have to get out of here."
6252,STEFAN, Uhh!
6253,DAMON," Come on, we gotta go."
6254,STEFAN, The other one.
6255,TREVOR, Uhh!
6256,DAMON, Can you get him in the car?
6257,ELENA, Yeah.
6258,DAMON," All right, go."
6259,ELENA, What about you?
6260,DAMON," You rescue, I'll distract. Go."
6261,FREDERICK," Turn that down. It's too quiet. Spread out. Now. You two, back of the house. Go. Check out both rooms. Cellar, now."
6262,STEFAN, Uhh.
6263,ELENA, Can you make it?
6264,STEFAN, Uhh! Unh.
6265,STEFAN, Ohh. You ok?
6266,ELENA," Yeah. Come on, we gotta keep going. Come on."
6267,STEFAN, Ugh.
6268,FREDERICK, Aah! Ugh!
6269,DAMON, Aah! Aah!
6270,ALARIC, I'm going after Frederick!
6271,ELENA," Come on, it's right over here."
6272,ELENA, Stefan...
6273,FREDERICK, Aah!
6274,STEFAN, Ugh! Uhh...
6275,FREDERICK, This is for Bethanne.
6276,STEFAN, Aah!
6277,FREDERICK, And this is for the tomb.
6278,ELENA, No!
6279,FREDERICK, Ugh! Unh!
6280,ELENA, Stefan...
6281,STEFAN, Unh. Uhh.
6282,ELENA," Stefan...Stefan... No, Stefan. Stefan, Stefan. Stefan! Stefan!"
6283,DAMON, Frederick is gone.
6284,ALARIC, Let's get out of here.
6285,DAMON, I'm gonna k*ll him.
6286,DAMON, How many of those vervain darts you have left?
6287,ALARIC, One.
6288,DAMON, Not gonna be enough.
6289,MATT," Hey, mom. What's going on?"
6290,MATT'S MOTHER, What's it look like?
6291,MATT," Honestly, I wouldn't know. I've never seen it before."
6292,MATT'S MOTHER," Well, sit down. You might wanna order pizza. I'm out of practice."
6293,MATT, Mmm. Mystery casserole. Yum.
6294,MATT'S MOTHER, Yeah. Some people aren't meant for the kitchen.
6295,MATT, What?
6296,MATT'S MOTHER," Uh, I know it's been rough. But I'm gonna try. I mean, really try this time. You just have to bear with me, ok?"
6297,MATT, Ok.
6298,MATT'S MOTHER, Ok. Good.
6299,MATT, You know I got it.
6300,MATT'S MOTHER," That bad, huh?"
6301,MATT, What happened to you?
6302,SHERIF," Hey, Matt."
6303,MATT, Hey. What's going on?
6304,SHERIF, Is your mom home?
6305,M. LOOKWOOD," Alright, give me 10 minutes. And keep it out of the news till I get there. Grab your stuff. We gotta go."
6306,TYLER, Kinda got half a burger left.
6307,M. LOOKWOOD, They found Vicki Donovan.
6308,TYLER, Are you serious? Where was she?
6309,M. LOOKWOOD, Storm unearthed the grave off county road. They just brought her body down to the morgue.
6310,JEREMY, Wait. She's dead?
6311,M. LOOKWOOD," Come on, we gotta go."
6312,ELENA," Stefan, please. Stefan! Oh, Stefan, please get up. Get up, Stefan. Stefan. Here."
6313,STEFAN," Elena, please run."
6314,ELENA, No.
6315,STEFAN, Please.
6316,ELENA, Stefan. My wrist. Here. Take my wrist. You need more bl*od.
6317,STEFAN," Go, Elena. Run. Run..."
6318,ELENA, No.
6319,STEFAN, I trust you.
6320,ALARIC," So, what you said to get me to do this, about my wife. It was a lie, wasn't it?"
6321,DAMON, Yep.
6322,PEARL, Stop. What's going on here? What did you do?
6323,DAMON, Me? Your merry little band of vampires spent the day torturing my brother.
6324,PEARL, Trust me. The parties responsible for this will be dealt with.
6325,DAMON, Our little arrangement doesn't work unless you learn to control them
6326,PEARL, This wasn't supposed to happen.
6327,DAMON," Well, it did. If I had a good side...Not a way to get on it."
6328,STEFAN, Argh! Ahh! Aah! Aah!
6329,ELENA,Stefan!
6330,STEFAN, Argh!
6331,ELENA, How are you doing?
6332,STEFAN, I'm ok. The wounds have mostly healed.
6333,ELENA, Good.
6334,STEFAN, Elena...
6335,ELENA, Yeah?
6336,STEFAN," What you did today, coming to help me...You could have been k*ll."
6337,ELENA, I know.
6338,STEFAN," And what I did, I'm sorry that...I'm sorry that you had to see it."
6339,ELENA, I've just never...You were like this other person. And it's my fault. I made you...
6340,STEFAN," What, no. no. no. You didn't make me do anything. You were saving my life. And I was saving yours. Everything's gonna be ok."
6341,ELENA(at phone)," Hey, Jer...What--what's going on? Oh, no."
6342,CAROLINE, I made you some coffee.
6343,MATT, Thanks.
6344,CAROLINE, Are you is there anything I can do?
6345,MATT," I just, uh...I need to be alone right now."
6346,ELENA, Matt...
6347,DAMON," That was fun. Oh, don't look at me like that. I know you hate me. Guess what? Everyone hates me. But you can't deny it. We were bad-ass."
6348,DAMON, Uhh. Happens.
6349,ELENA, Jer... Are you ok?
6350,JEREMY, I'm gonna go get some sleep.
6351,ANNA, What are you doing?
6352,JEREMY, My...my friend Vicki... She's...She's dead.
6353,ANNA, Vicki? The one you thought was a...
6354,JEREMY, Yep. Turns out she's been dead all along.
6355,ANNA, She's the reason you wanted to turn? You wanted to be with her?
6356,JEREMY," Look, I'm sorry."
6357,Damon, You can turn it out a little bit? It's not annoying yet
6358,Stefan, Sorry
6359,Damon, When are you going back to school?
6360,Stefan, Soon
6361,Damon," Oh come on. Just drink already. Come on, this self-detox is not natural"
6362,Stefan, You can get that away from me please?
6363,Damon, How long have you take to wing yourself of the last time you've yield off?
6364,Damon, It's not good
6365,Stefan, I'll be fine; it just takes a little bit of time
6366,Damon," I don't get it; you know, you don't have to k*ll to survive. That's what bl*od banks are for. I haven't hunt in a human in… God way too long"
6367,Stefan, Oh I'm impressed
6368,Damon, It's completely self-serving. I'm trying to get the town off the trail of vampires which is not very easy considering that there is an entire tomb of them running around
6369,Stefan, What are we planning on doing about that?
6370,Damon, We are not going to do much of anything if you don't restrength. There's nothing wrong with part taking in a healthy diet of human bl*od from a bl*od bank. You're not actually k*ll anyone
6371,Stefan, I have my reasons
6372,Damon," What are those holly little reasons? We never actually discuss that. You know, I'll love to hear this story"
6373,Stefan, You're really enjoying this aren't you? Just watching me struggle?
6374,Damon, Very much
6375,Stefan, I hate to break into you Damon but… I actually have it under complete control
6376,Damon," You do? Well, then you should just carry on, making the rest of us vampires look bad"
6377,Damon, Have a great day Stefan
6378,Damon," oh, hey, I almost forgot. Oops"
6379,Elena," Come on Jeremy, we have school! Walking at the door now!"
6380,Jenna, Forgot his (She gives her a thermos) 
6381,Elena, Thank you
6382,John (with a smile), Elena!
6383,Elena, Uncle John! Hi
6384,John (looking at Jenna), Jenna
6385,Jenna," John, you made it"
6386,John, I said I'll be here by nine
6387,Jenna, Oh what you say and what you do are typically two very different things
6388,Jeremy," Uncle John, what's up?"
6389,John, Hey!
6390,John, I had some business in town; I thought that a visit was in order
6391,Elena, How long are you staying?
6392,John, I don't know yet
6393,Elena," ok, I've got to go to school, I see you later"
6394,John, So what's up with Jeremy?
6395,Jenna," He just lost a friend, so try to be sensitive"
6396,John (laughing), I'm always sensitive
6397,Jenna," Right, so really how long are you staying?"
6398,John, Can you at least pretend that you're happy to see me?
6399,Jenna (joking)," oh my god John! It's so good to see you. How have you been? (She becomes serious again): No, I can't "
6400,John, Do you really think that I was just gonna sign the papers and send them back?
6401,Jenna, Actually I did
6402,John, I'm not going to let you sell my brother's office
6403,Jenna, It's not up to you or me; it belongs to Jeremy and Elena
6404,John," Yeah but they're minors, so I get the final say, I have to deal with it"
6405,Elena, He said his trip is open ended
6406,Matt," Uncle John, I never really liked that guy"
6407,Elena, Does anyone?
6408,Matt, I'm here for moral support if you need me
6409,Elena," Thanks, I think I'll suffer this one alone; you've been through enough"
6410,Matt," Thank you by the way, for just… for everything you did at Vicki's funeral. I couldn't have done it without you"
6411,Elena, Of course Matt
6412,Elena," So, was Caroline still baking for you guys, around the clock? "
6413,Caroline," She finally went to her dad, which is a good thing because my mom was going to strangle her if she dropped out for more lasagna"
6414,Jeremy, No thanks
6415,Tyler, What's your problem?
6416,Jeremy, I just don't want any
6417,Tyler, Okay; they say she OD 
6418,Jeremy," That's what I don't get, she was doing okay"
6419,Tyler, Apparently not
6420,Jeremy, How did she end up buried in the woods? That's what I don't understand 
6421,Tyler, By whoever was with her when she OD 
6422,Jeremy, Yeah but when you leave her there you don't take the time to bury her
6423,Tyler," Maybe she saw something and… Hell man, I don't know"
6424,Sheriff Forbes," The coroner office has officially ruled Vicky's Donovan's death a drug overdose. Her family has been notified, the truth will stay in this room and we can put this behind us"
6425,Mayor Lockwood," Thank you Sheriff. And on to a more pressing issue, John Gilbert has asked to say a few words"
6426,Mayor Lockwood," Welcome back John, it's good to see you"
6427,John," Hello everyone, it's wonderful to see you, I wished it were on better circumstances. As a founding family member I found it's my duty to report some very distressing news"
6428,Damon, He's a Gilbert? 
6429,Sheriff Forbes, Elena's uncle. His name is John but I call him Jackass 
6430,John," A hospital bl*od bank in the neighboring county of Amherst has reported several breakings over the past two weeks. 7 hunters, 4 campers and 2 states employees have been reported missing as well. All of this was in a 75 miles radius of Mystic Falls"
6431,Mayor Lockwood," Okay okay, no need to get alarmed right at this moment"
6432,Sheriff Forbes (To Damon), Mean he doesn't want to cancel the founders' day kickoff party 
6433,John," You think all of your problems are over but I'm here to tell you, nothing's been solved"
6434,Alaric, I made a copy of a paper Jeremy wrote for me. I think you should take a look at it
6435,(He gives the paper to Elena. She reads the title, fact or fiction: The truth about vampires in Mystic Falls) 
6436,Elena, Jeremy wrote this?
6437,Alaric, It's very clear that he didn't think it was real
6438,Elena, I really hope you're right because I've done so much to protect him from all of this
6439,Alaric," So, how do you deal with it?"
6440,Elena, What do you mean?
6441,Alaric, With all the lies and the secrets. You have to lie to everyone who's important to you
6442,Elena," It's not safe for them to know the truth. So yes I keep it from them, but it's only because I love them"
6443,Alaric, I think Stefan is a good guy. But at the end of the day he's still a vampire
6444,Elena, I know it's hard to understand but Stefan is different. He'll never do anything to hurt me
6445,Jeremy, I've no interest in the founder's day kickoff party
6446,John, Sure you do its tradition
6447,Jenna, It will be our role to break the tradition
6448,John," The Gilberts have been a part of this town for a hundred and fifty years. We're one of the founding families and with that distinction comes certain obligations including going to the party. One day, when you'll can appreciate the significance I'll tell you all about your heritage"
6449,Jenna," Hmm, the Gilbert's family legacy. I forgot how secret it was. I'm not a Gilbert so I was never cool enough to hear it"
6450,Jeremy (To John), Why did she hate you?
6451,John, We used to sleep together
6452,Jenna, I'm standing right here
6453,Elena, Why would he write a report on vampires? Do you think he's trying to remember?
6454,Stefan," Damon took away those memories for good, you don't have to worry about that. I tell you what: why don't you just ask him?"
6455,Elena, I… I can't
6456,Stefan, Why not? I mean if he doesn't know anything this is just an innocent question
6457,Elena," I don't even know how to talk to him anymore. I mean, we used to be a lot more open with each other. But now, with all these secrets just pilling up… You know, I haven't even told him that I am adopted yet "
6458,Stefan, Maybe it's time you start open up to him again. I'm not saying you should tell him everything but just try to find out what he does know and be prepared for it 
6459,Elena," What about you, how are you doing? "
6460,Stefan," Much, much better. I'm still, you know… a little jittery, a little bit on edge but I'm gonna be okay"
6461,Elena, I've been really worried about you and I missed you
6462,Stefan, I just needed to let it go for a while and let my body rejust. It's only been a few days
6463,Elena, It feels like a lifetime
6464,Stefan, I've missed you too
6465,Elena, Stefan what's wrong? Stefan?
6466,Elena, Oh god you're here
6467,Damon, You ask I come. I'm easy like that
6468,Damon (loud), No Elena I will not go to your bedroom with you
6469,Damon," Oh, just like I remember"
6470,Elena, Stop messing around
6471,Damon, Did you know that your uncle has been kicking at the founder council?
6472,Elena, What?
6473,Damon, Yep
6474,Elena," Perfect, we'll just add it to the list of how everything is falling apart"
6475,Damon, What happened right there?
6476,Elena, Uh… nothing
6477,Elena," Look Damon, I'm worried about Stefan. He says that everything's okay but he's clearly struggling. How long it is gonna take before he's going back to normal?"
6478,Damon, A few days. Give or take 
6479,Elena, It's been a few days
6480,Damon," Give then, I don't know. What's the big deal?"
6481,Elena, He's not himself Damon
6482,Damon," Well, maybe his problem is that he has spent too long not being himself"
6483,Elena, Please don't make me sorry for asking you
6484,Damon," It is what it is Elena. The Stefan you know was ""good behavior Stefan"", ‘under control Stefan"", ""Fight his nature into an annoying excessive level Stefan"" but if you think there isn't another part to this then you have not been paying attention"
6485,Elena," He's not you, not even close"
6486,Damon, Because he doesn't want to be me. That doesn't mean that deep down he's not
6487,Elena, Hey
6488,Jeremy, What's up?
6489,Elena, Do you have some time to talk?
6490,Jeremy," Uh, yeah, sure"
6491,Elena, Not here. Come on; let's get out of the house
6492,Jeremy, I just can't believe mom and dad never told you that you were adopted
6493,Elena, Sure they would have eventually
6494,Jeremy, Why were you worried about what I'll think?
6495,Elena, Because… I don't know it's weird. Going you're whole lives thinking you're related by bl*od to someone
6496,Jeremy, Does it bother you we're not?
6497,Elena," No, Jer… you're my brother that's all that matters"
6498,Elena," So, Mr. Saltzman said you've been doing great in history now"
6499,Jeremy, Yeah yeah is has really been helping me out. He gave me some extra credits and stuff 
6500,Elena, He loved your vampire paper
6501,Jeremy, He thought I had a clever angle
6502,Elena, What drew you to that subject matter?
6503,Jeremy," I don't know, boredom or maybe I'm just as nuts as long line of Gilbert crazies"
6504,Elena, Gilberts aren't crazy
6505,Jeremy," Easy for you to say, you're not one"
6506,Elena, Ouch
6507,Stefan, Oh god! I shouldn't be here
6508,Damon," Come on, don't be a darner, it's a party for the founding families! That would be us. That would be rude to skip it"
6509,Stefan," You know, I really liked you a lot better when you hated everybody"
6510,Damon, Oh I still do. I just love that they love me 
6511,Damon, How are you feeling?
6512,Stefan," I'm good, I'm fine"
6513,Damon, No cravings? No urges? Is that whisky you've been drinking all day doing his job?
6514,Damon, We are who we are Stefan. Nothing's gonna change that
6515,Stefan, Ah! Nothing will make you happier to just see me given up hein Damon?
6516,Damon," Whatever, it's inevitable "
6517,Stefan," Well, I'm gonna find Elena"
6518,Damon, Don't embarrass me young man!
6519,Mayor Lockwood, I'm so glad you can join us tonight
6520,Kelly, It was nice of you to reach out to us
6521,Mayor Lockwood," This town is one big family, when we lose a member we all have to come together"
6522,Mayor Lockwood, Matt
6523,Matt, Mayor
6524,Kelly, Well I guess dead kid rate a special greeting from the mayor
6525,Matt, God mom!
6526,Kelly, I need a drink
6527,Tyler, check this out!
6528,Matt, Your dad is going to b*at you down if he catches you
6529,Tyler, Yeah. I'll love if he tries
6530,Matt, screw him!
6531,Elena, Hey!
6532,Stefan, Hey. How are you
6533,Elena, Are you drunk?
6534,Stefan," Okay, I know it's a little weird but it's really helping me. The alcohol takes the edge off"
6535,Elena, You're totally that drunken high school guy that parties sneaking booze
6536,Stefan, I totally am yeah
6537,Elena, How worried do I need to be?
6538,Stefan," Oh no! you don't need to be worried. It's just until the cravings go away. Listen, I think we should enjoy it while it lasts. Would you like to dance with me?"
6539,Elena, You hate dancing. I usually have to beg you
6540,Stefan," No, no, no you have to beg sober me. The drunk me there is no begging necessary"
6541,Elena, There's no one dancing 
6542,Stefan, That's because they need something better to dance to. I'll be right back
6543,Kelly, Yeah… That's not gonna work. I already tried to buy the guy with 20 box and a date. He said Carol Lockwood has complete control over the music choices)
6544,Elena, You'd be surprised by what Stefan can accomplish when he puts his mind to it
6545,Kelly, Thank god!
6546,Damon, Have I entered an alternate universe where Stefan is fun?
6547,Elena, Is he gonna be okay?
6548,Damon, Eventually. One way or another
6549,Elena, History teacher at three o' clock
6550,Jenna, How do I look?
6551,Elena, Beautiful
6552,Alaric (to Jenna), I was looking for you
6553,Jenna, Here I am. I haven't seen you in a while
6554,Alaric, Well uh… (He looks at Elena) Things have been a little crazy but I'm here now. Do you want to get a drink?
6555,Jenna, Sure
6556,Alaric, Okay cool
6557,Matt, When did this happen?
6558,Elena, DJ had a change of heart
6559,Matt, Do you want to dance?
6560,Elena, I don't know
6561,Matt, Yes
6562,Elena, Matt!
6563,Damon, You know I love a woman in uniform but I have to sigh with this one. You look… you look smashing
6564,Sheriff Forbes, thank you Damon. Cheers! I needed that. You know I had my doubts about you at first but like everyone else in the council you've won me over
6565,Damon, Thanks Liz. It's really nice how welcoming the council has been. I like my life here in Mystic Falls. Sort of feel like home again
6566,Sheriff Forbes," Well, you're not gonna like what I have to tell you. Jonathan Gilbert's claims check out. bl*od bank, the missing people, all is true. We might have a problem"
6567,Jeremy, Excuse me Sheriff. I was curious if there's been any more information about what happened to Vicky Donovan?
6568,Sheriff Forbes, It was an overdose Jeremy
6569,Jeremy, Yeah but her body was buried. Somebody must have done that
6570,Sheriff Forbes, We're aware of that. The investigation is ongoing but there's nothing more I can tell you at this time. I'm sorry
6571,Jeremy, It's okay
6572,Stefan, Please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend
6573,The man, Wow! Watch it!
6574,Elena," I'm sorry, my fault, I'm clumsy"
6575,The man, Then get off the dance floor
6576,Elena, Excuse me?
6577,Stefan, It's not a way to talk to a lady
6578,The man, Whatever
6579,Stefan, I think you need to apologize
6580,The man, I'm sorry
6581,Stefan, Now say it like you mean it
6582,The man," I'm really, really sorry"
6583,Elena, Stefan its fine
6584,Stefan, Now walk away
6585,Elena, Have you noticed what your brother has been up to?
6586,Damon," No, I have been too preoccupied with yours"
6587,Damon, Jeremy has been asking questions about Vicky Donovan's death
6588,Elena, He knows that her death was ruled by an overdose
6589,Damon," Really? ""Oh but sheriff, someone buried her. Who would do that?"" I know I know! Me!"
6590,Elena," No, I don't want you to compel him"
6591,Damon, If he keeps asking questions…
6592,Elena, Damon no I'm serious. I'm not going to do that to him again. I handle it
6593,Damon, okay. Don't say I didn't warned you
6594,Tyler, I saw that
6595,Kelly, Shut! We keep that between you and me. Where is the lady's room?
6596,Tyler," This way, I show you"
6597,Kelly (watching his glass), Is that soda?
6598,Kelly, Vodka. Thank god!
6599,John, Damon right?
6600,Damon, John
6601,John, We didn't get the chance to meet at the council meeting
6602,Damon, Yeah. That's a pleasure. Are you enjoying the kick-off?
6603,John, Oh yeah. I forgot how much fun these small town celebrations can be
6604,Damon, Yeah. When was the last time you were here?
6605,John," Hasn't been that long, my brother's funeral. How long have you been in town?"
6606,Damon," Well, not long at all"
6607,John, So what do you think Damon? You know this vampire problem is real right? It's a potential bl*od bath
6608,Damon, I would not overreact John
6609,John," Oh, I think it's like 1864 all over again, vampires running a mock. I guess we just gonna have to hunt them down, throw them in a church and burn them to ache"
6610,Damon, This is the story hein? 
6611,John," Part of the story, yeah"
6612,Damon," Oh, there's more?"
6613,John," Oh there's lot more. See, it seems there was a tomb under the church, where vampires were hidden, waiting for someone to come along and set them free. But you already knew that didn't you?"
6614,John, Because you're the one that did it
6615,Damon, And you're telling me this why?
6616,John, I just thought we get the introduction out of the way
6617,Damon, You know that I could rip your throat out before anyone would notice?
6618,John, Yeah
6619,Damon," Yeah, okay. But you probably ingested vervain so…"
6620,John, Why don't you take a bite to find out?
6621,Damon (smiling), This not worth my time
6622,Elena, Jer? I heard about your conversation with Sheriff Forbes
6623,Jeremy, No one is trying to figure out what happened to her. They all want to believe that she ODED 
6624,Elena, Coroner's office confirmed it. If that's what they say happened then…
6625,Jeremy, Is that what you believe?
6626,Elena, What do you think happened?
6627,Jeremy, I think that somebody k*ll her and buried her body and I don't think we should write it off just ‘cause it's easy
6628,Elena, They're just doing what they can to move on
6629,Jeremy, The truth is the only thing that gonna help people to move on
6630,Elena," Jer, just let it go okay? Whatever it was she's gone now"
6631,Jeremy, Whatever it was? So you don't think it was an overdose?
6632,Elena, Yes… I do
6633,Jeremy, Is there something you're not telling me?
6634,Jeremy, Why aren't you looking at me?
6635,Elena," Sorry, that doesn't mean anything"
6636,Jeremy, If there was something else you'd telling me right?
6637,Elena, Of course I would
6638,Kelly, Oh god! I can't even walk
6639,Tyler," know, me neither"
6640,Kelly," Oh my god, Matt is going to k*ll me"
6641,Tyler, He won't even notice. I think he's actually having some fun for once
6642,Kelly," Yeah, I know I just should be on my best behavior because of Vicky but I don't want to think about it. I can't, because if I do…"
6643,Tyler," Yeah, I was a dick to her, I was really bad. That's what I hate is I can't make any of it right. It's like I don't deserve to even miss her"
6644,Kelly, You're nice to talk to me. I don't have anyone to talk to
6645,Tyler, I don't have anyone to talk to either
6646,Matt, Who knew I've been missing all the fun at the founder's parties? 
6647,Elena, This is rare believe me
6648,Matt, Is it bad that I'm enjoying myself?
6649,Elena, No it's great that you are enjoying yourself. Thanks for making me dance
6650,Matt," Hey, it's normal"
6651,Matt," Air, I need some air. Come with me? "
6652,Elena, Sure
6653,Matt, You haven't seen my mom have you?
6654,Elena," No, not in a while"
6655,Elena, Oh my god
6656,Matt, What are you doing man?
6657,Kelly, Matt?!
6658,Matt (screaming), Mom!
6659,Tyler, Whoa dude calm down
6660,Alaric, What the hell is that?
6661,Mayor Lockwood, I'll take it from here; I'll take it from here (To Tyler): Are you hurt? Go to clean up its okay
6662,Mayor Lockwood," Everything is fine. Come on everybody let's get back to the party let's go. Come on, have a good time!"
6663,Elena, Are you okay?
6664,Matt, Where is she?
6665,Elena, I don't know. Put your head up
6666,Damon, You want to hear the bad news or the really bad news?
6667,Stefan, Actually I don't want any news Damon
6668,Damon," Alright, let me rephrase. Do you want to hear how the council is back at vampire move or how I just k*ll Uncle John Gilbert?"
6669,Stefan, What?
6670,Damon, Great party by the way hein?
6671,Stefan, Is everything alright?
6672,Kelly," No. I ruined it, I always ruin it. What is wrong with me?"
6673,Kelly, What are you doing?
6674,Stefan," Uh, I'm sorry"
6675,Damon, You got to be kidding me
6676,Mayor Lockwood," Thank you all, thank you very much, thank you. Thank you all for joining us tonight in just a few minutes we will officially begin the countdown for our upcoming founders' day celebration and it's a very special one this year. The one hundred fiftieth birthday of our town and I would like to welcome back one of our town favorite's sons to do the honors of ringing our official bell. John Gilbert, would you please join me up here?"
6677,John," One hundred and fifty years of community, prosperity, family. We take care of each other, we look after each other, and we protect each other (He looks at Damon); it's good to be home"
6678,Damon, Look at his right hand
6679,Alaric, Who?
6680,Damon, Town favorite's son. Look at his ring
6681,Alaric," Well, it looks like mine"
6682,Damon," Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence if he didn't just came back from the death 5 minutes ago. Where the hell did you get that ring?"
6683,Alaric," Isobel, my wife"
6684,Damon," Who gave birth to Elena, under the medical care of the esteem DR Grayson Gilbert, John's brother! "
6685,Alaric, Do you think John knew Isobel?
6686,Damon, I think John knows a lot of things
6687,The man, Sorry about that man. I really am terribly sorry
6688,Stefan, You don't want to do this man
6689,The man, I'm sorry about that too. All I can do is apologizing. What's that about?
6690,Stefan, Get out of my way please
6691,The man, No girl to show off for now? I see what this is
6692,The man, What are you man?
6693,Elena, Hey! Are you okay? What happened?
6694,The man, My arm. I lost my balance and fell. I'm clumsy
6695,Mayor Lockwood, Let's go
6696,Tyler, Dad I'm sorry. I don't even know what happened. I was drinking and… I lost control. I can't explain it
6697,Mayor Lockwood, It is the last time you ever embarrass this family 
6698,Kelly, What are you doing? Matt don't
6699,Matt, I can't do it anymore mom so just go alright? You've done it before so much time that I don't even count 
6700,Kelly, I'm not leaving you. Matty!
6701,Matt (screaming), Mom! Don't you get it? I'm better off without you
6702,Kelly," No, tonight was… god I'm so sorry. I know I failed you and I failed Vicky but I won't do it to you again. I promise I'll get it together"
6703,Matt, I want you out of the house and my life by morning
6704,Damon, Going somewhere?
6705,John, I've never liked to be the last one to leave a party. It's too desperate. You're going to k*ll me again or you're gonna let Mr. Saltzman do your dirty work?
6706,Alaric," Okay, you obviously know who I am"
6707,John," I do. Alaric Saltzman, a high school history teacher with a secret"
6708,Damon, Sure you know a lot for someone who just got to town
6709,John," More than you can imagine, Damon. My knowledge of this town goes beyond anything that you (He looks at Damon) or you (He looks at Alaric) or the council knows. So, if you're planning on some clever high speed snatch ring vampire k*ll move, know that if I die, everything I know goes to the council including the fascinating little tale of the originals Salvatore's brothers and their present day return to Mystic Falls."
6710,Alaric, How did you get that ring?
6711,John," I had herrited one, my brother gray the other. This was his (He shows his ring to them) and I wouldn't give mine to Isobel if I had known she'll handed over to another guy"
6712,Damon, So you did know her
6713,John, Who do you think send her on your way which wants to become a vampire?
6714,Damon, You send her?
6715,John," Guilty. Why, did you think someone else send her? Maybe Katherine Pierce?"
6716,Damon, How do you know about Katherine?
6717,John, How do I know anything Damon?
6718,Damon, What do you want?
6719,John, So many questions. It was a pleasure meeting you Rick. I heard so much about you
6720,Jenna, No so excited that we have another month oh these founder's day events
6721,Elena, Don't tell me about it
6722,Elena, Are you okay?
6723,Jeremy, Fine
6724,Elena, Are you sure?
6725,Jeremy, I'm fine Elena
6726,Elena, Oh my god you scared me!
6727,Stefan, Sorry. I'm sorry I ran off earlier
6728,Elena, What happened? Is everything okay?
6729,Stefan," Uh, no"
6730,Elena, Talk to me
6731,Elena, Stefan tell me
6732,Stefan," I tried so hard to keep together tonight and it was working, it was working but then Matt's mom, she got hurt and she was bleeding and I had her bl*od on my hands"
6733,Elena, And then what happened?
6734,Stefan," And then that guy on the parking lot, I wanted to feed on him and it took everything inside of me not to do it"
6735,Elena, But you didn't?
6736,Stefan," No, but I wanted to. Oh my god. Elena, my head is pounding. I feel like my skin is on fire. I have this hunger inside of me that I've never felt before in my entire life and all I keep thinking about is how I promised that I would never keep anything from you, and so I'm telling you this"
6737,Elena, That's okay; I need you to tell me these things
6738,Stefan," But I don't want you to see me like this, I don't want you to know that this side of me exists"
6739,Elena," Stefan, you're gonna get through this. I'm gonna help you go through. It's gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay"
6740,Stefan," Sorry, I can't, I'm afraid of what I could do to you"
6741,Elena, I'm not
6742,Elena," Stefan, I'm not"
6743,Elena," I'm not, okay?"
6744,Stefan, I love you so much
6745,Elena," Oh, I love you too"
6746,Damon, We have a problem Stefan and when I say problem I mean global crisis. It seems that Uncle John…
6747,Damon, You don't look so good. Its different this time isn't it? The need is too strong. Of course it would be after all these years
6748,Damon, Have a good night brother
6749,Elena, Nice car
6750,Stefan, That was a waste to leaves it in the garage
6751,Elena, I didn't know we were coming back today
6752,Stefan," You know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great and I figured it was time for me to get back in the things"
6753,Elena," Is that mean you're okay now, with all the cravings?"
6754,Stefan," Yeah, I mean the worst part is over so… now what I want to do is just spent as much time with you as possible"
6755,Elena, I'm okay with that
6756,Stefan," Hey, thank you for helping me get through the rough patch"
6757,Elena," You're welcome (pause, they look each other). We are going to be late"
6758,Stefan," Okay, uh, you know what? I'll catch up with you, I'm gonna grab my stuff. I'll be right behind you"
6759,Elena, Okay
6760,Sheriff Forbes, There was a disturbance at the hospital bl*od bank last night; some of the supply was compromised
6761,Damon, Compromised? You mean stolen?
6762,Sheriff Forbes, We almost missed it. The inventory records were altered but when the night manager was questioned he had no recollection of changing them
6763,John, That means that the vampire who stole the bl*od used mind control to hide the theft
6764,Damon (looking at John), I know what you meant
6765,Sheriff Forbes, We wouldn't noticed if John hadn't alerted us to recent discrepancies in other hospital bl*od banks in the county
6766,Damon," How lucky for us, we have John "
6767,Sheriff Forbes," We're stepping up security at the hospital, giving the guard vervain to prevent this from happening again"
6768,John," Sheriff, may I offer a suggestion? Why don't Damon and I put our hands together? We can track down whoever is doing this"
6769,Sheriff Forbes, Truthfully I can use the extra hands. Is that something you would be willing to do?
6770,Damon," of course, I mean if it'll help"
6771,John," I think we could make a good team, don't you think Damon?"
6772,Damon," John, whenever I can do to help keep this town safe; even if it means spending time with you"
6773,Alaric," Okay, this week we're gonna set outside the regular curriculum for a lesson on local history as we approach founder's day. Apparently the community lead feels it's more important that world w*r 2 but hey what do I know?"
6774,Bonnie, Sorry I'm late
6775,Alaric," Well, its lake we will be on full occupancy today. Welcome home Bonnie"
6776,"(Someone is ringing the bell, Damon opens the door", it's Anna) 
6777,Damon," I suppose I should be grateful, you learned how to use the bell"
6778,Anna, I'm here on behalf of my mother
6779,Damon, On behalf of or in spite of?
6780,Anna," I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan. Undocked him, tortured him… It wasn't supposed to go down like that"
6781,Damon, You're plain house of half of a tomb of really pissed of vampires. What do you think was going to happen?
6782,Anna, My mom is devastated; they tried to over throw her
6783,Damon, Why isn't she here telling me this?
6784,Anna, She doesn't really do apology
6785,Damon," Well, it's a coincidence, ‘cause I don't do forgiveness. Let just roll long. And if you're going continue playing house with these little vampires pets, you might wanna stop rubbing the bl*od bank dry because they're onto it "
6786,Anna, I haven't been to the local bl*od bank in at least a week
6787,Damon, Then it's one of you others
6788,Anna, The others are gone Damon
6789,Damon," Well, where did they go?"
6790,Anna, They were cut off of this town. After what happened with your brother my mom kicked them out and they took off. It's just us and Harper now
6791,Elena, Bonnie!
6792,Bonnie, Hey
6793,Elena," Hey, i tried to grab you after class but you already taken off. How are you? How's your family?"
6794,Bonnie," We're dealing, it's been hard"
6795,Elena, Everyone here really missed you
6796,Bonnie," Yeah, I just had so much to deal with after Grams' funeral and, honestly after you told me the tomb spell failed I just didn't really want to come back"
6797,Elena, I hope you'll understand why I called… I wanted you to know before you came home
6798,Bonnie, I understand why. I just… shouldn't know
6799,Elena, I know it's been really hard…
6800,Caroline, Bonnie! Bonnie! Thank god you're home!
6801,Caroline, I know we talked everyday but I missed you
6802,Caroline, How are you doing?
6803,Bonnie," Better. You know, glad to be back and trying to keep myself busy"
6804,Caroline," Well, I can help with that. Major wardrobe problem. You need to help me pick up the perfect dress for the founder's court"
6805,Elena, The founder's court? Did I miss something?
6806,Caroline," The founder's court! You know, Miss Mystic Falls. They announced it today and you and I are both on it"
6807,Elena, Oh my god! We signed for this so long ago… I completely forgot
6808,Caroline," So, are you dropping out then?"
6809,Elena, I can't
6810,Caroline, No?
6811,Bonnie, Her mom is the one who wanted her into this
6812,Damon, How was school?
6813,Stefan, Fine
6814,Damon," Yeah? Same old, same old? Nothing new? No stories to bring home?"
6815,Stefan," You make it small talk, why?"
6816,Damon," You seemed off the ship lately, less dump and glum, more peps in you steps"
6817,Stefan, And you think it's because I drank human bl*od again
6818,Damon, I don't want to brag but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you
6819,Stefan," Well, I hate to push the bubble but I'm clean"
6820,Damon," Yeah, not possible"
6821,Stefan, Not only isn't possible but it is quite true
6822,Damon," Stefan, just be serious for a second. You spent the last century and a half being a poster child for Prozac and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human bl*od. Nothing"
6823,Stefan, I'm clean
6824,Damon, You're lying!
6825,Stefan, Believe what you want
6826,Elena, I'm sorry for the short notice; I didn't even know that the contest was coming up much as less that I will be in it
6827,Stefan, I will be happy to escort you anyway
6828,Elena, My mom was really into this founder's day stuff. She was even Miss Mystic in her day. I want to do it for her
6829,Stefan," It'll be great, we'll have fun"
6830,Elena," Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you"
6831,Stefan, I love you too
6832,Damon," Well well, he's a liar and a thief. So, when are you gonna share? "
6833,Stefan," Go ahead, help yourself"
6834,Damon," No, no, no I'm talking about the fact that you have a closet bl*od junkie"
6835,Stefan," So, I'm drinking bl*od again. You're the one that shoved it on me, what's your problem? I have it under control"
6836,Damon, Under control? You've robbed the hospital!
6837,Stefan," So, what's your point?"
6838,Damon," Fine, whatever man, drink up. Just remember, we're trying to keep a low profile. Why don't you just walk up to Sheriff Forbes and ask her to tap a vein?"
6839,Stefan, Have my actions negatively impacted you? I can't imagine what that must feel like
6840,Damon," Yeah, what Elena thinks about the new… you?"
6841,Stefan, Nothing's changed; I'm still the same person
6842,Damon, Clearly
6843,Stefan, Elena doesn't need to know anything yet
6844,Damon, You've been out the human stuff for years Stefan. If you're having problems controlling…
6845,Stefan, I don't have any problems
6846,Damon," Who do you think you're talking to? I know what it's like. The Jekyll and Hyde feeling, that switch, sometime you goes off and snap. Right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping"
6847,Stefan, I know that it pains you to see this but I'm fine okay? I'm fine
6848,Stefan," So please, do me a favor and back off"
6849,Carol Lockwood," This year's queen will have the special honor of taking stage at the one hundred fiftieth founder's day gala. Before we crown a winner, we'd like to get to know a bit more about each of you"
6850,Caroline, I'm on the MF beautification comity; I volunteered the poor soup kitchen 
6851,Elena, I recognize that I haven't been as involved this year that I used to be
6852,Caroline, I implemented this year's go green campaign at school
6853,Elena, I've been distracted and I let a lot of things aside
6854,One of the girls, I don't think it's wrong for me to win two years in a row
6855,Amber, I was surprised to have been selected since I'm not one of the founding families
6856,Elena, But I'm aware of what an honor this is and I want you to know that I take it seriously 
6857,Caroline, I worked for the recycling program and was in charge for the police's this year raffle
6858,Tina Fell, Just because my D.U.I. made my community service mandatory doesn't mean that I was any less committed
6859,Elena," This was really important to my mother. She believed in community, family, honor and loyalty. It's the legacy she'd left for me"
6860,John, Hey partner!
6861,Damon, What do you want?
6862,John, You haven't return any of my calls
6863,Damon, Most people take it has a hint 
6864,John, Where do we start looking for vampires?
6865,Damon," How do you act John? You obviously don't care about catching vampires, you're here talking to me"
6866,John," Actually, I care very much"
6867,Damon," What Isobel says about that? I mean, considering that she is one"
6868,John," Isobel and I share a mutual interest. The original Jonathan Gilbert has an invention and it was stolen by a vampire. That vampire was then b*rned alive in Fell's church, that's what Jonathan thought and the invention was lost forever. But then the vampires weren't k*ll, were they? They were trapped and now they're free, thanks to you which means the invention is retrieval"
6869,Damon, What is it?
6870,John, The only thing that matter is that I want it back and you're going to help me if you want your secret safe
6871,Damon," Why bring me into it John? I mean, I don't know what you are talking about much less who has it"
6872,John," Oh come on Damon! You were around back then, you know what this people are, what they look like. He was friendly with a woman who turned out to be a vampire. Her name was Pearl. Is that ring a bell?"
6873,Damon, I'm not playing anymore. Get out
6874,John, I beg your pardon?
6875,Damon," You know, I only entertain this whole blackmail skin thing of yours because I thought you and Isobel could lead me to Katherine but see, now I know you've no idea where Katherine is, because if you did you would know that Katherine and Pearl were best friends. See, you don't know everything did you?"
6876,John, I'll tell the entire council what you are
6877,Damon," Go for it! I'll k*ll every last one of them. Then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll k*ll you too. Do you understand that?"
6878,Carol Lockwood," Stay focus, right hand around. Flirt with your eyes (Elena and Stefan are laughing) Left hand around"
6879,Elena, This is ridiculous
6880,Stefan, You're only saying that because you don't know how to do it
6881,Elena, Sorry. Only one of us was around when the dance was invented
6882,Stefan, Ouch!
6883,Mrs. Lockwood, No! No! There's no touching during this part. It's about the simple intimacy of the near touch
6884,Stefan," If you ask me, the 'near touch' is overrated"
6885,Elena, You seem to be in a good mood
6886,Stefan, Is that a bad thing? Would you prefer me to be burring and tortured?
6887,Elena," Hey, I'm not complaining"
6888,Caroline, The Fell cousins don't have a sh*t and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like its founding families only which of course it is. So that leaves Elena which totally has a simply vote since her parents died. How can I compete with that?
6889,Bonnie," Very nice, very sensitive"
6890,Caroline," Oh I'm sorry, this must sound really unimportant"
6891,Bonnie," It's okay, I get it, you want to win"
6892,Caroline," Well, my grandmother was Miss Mystic and both of my ants. My mom is the only one who didn't get the gene and I want this. I actually deserve this"
6893,Elena, Hey
6894,Stefan," Hey, how are you?"
6895,Caroline," I begged Bonnie to have filled in for Matt, he had to work today"
6896,Elena," Bonnie, do you have a minute?"
6897,Bonnie, we only have 30 minutes for rehearsal
6898,Elena," It'll only take a minute, please?"
6899,Elena, Bonnie you have to tell me what's wrong
6900,Bonnie, It not worth talking about
6901,Elena, What do you mean don't worth it? You barely said ten words to me and you won't even look at Stefan. Is that what it is? Is it Stefan?
6902,Bonnie," Look, Elena, I can't just pretend that everything's okay. Everything my grams did was to protect us from those vampires from the tomb. And now they're out which means she died for nothing"
6903,Elena," I'm so sorry Bonnie, What can I do to make it better?"
6904,Bonnie," That just did, there's nothing you can do. I blame him Elena, him and Damon and I'm not gonna put you in a situation where you have to choose sides. I'm just having a hard time with it okay?"
6905,Alaric, Are you okay?
6906,Stefan," Yes, I'm sorry. I was just… feeling sick"
6907,(Elena goes down the stairs; she has her dress on the arm. Someone knocks at the door, it's Alaric) 
6908,Elena, Hey
6909,Stefan, Hi
6910,Elena, I heard you're driving
6911,Alaric, Yeah I'm. Let me get that for you
6912,Alaric, Thanks
6913,Alaric, How… how is Stefan?
6914,Elena, What do you mean?
6915,Alaric," You know, he seems on edge"
6916,Elena," He went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while but he's back now"
6917,John, Alaric. Hey buddy what are you doing here?
6918,Alaric, I'm the chauffeur
6919,John, I thought I was driving
6920,Jenna," No need, we go with Rick"
6921,Elena, Are we ready?
6922,Jenna, Jeremy can drive with you
6923,Damon, n the running for Miss Mystic Falls?
6924,Anna," Sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heals to blend in. I remember this event from 1864, I was supposed to honor before everything happened"
6925,Damon," Ah, nostalgia's a bitch"
6926,Anna, If you're just gonna mock me can you move along please?
6927,Damon," John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an aterfact from Jonathan senior, senior back in 1864"
6928,Anna," What are you, his errant boy?"
6929,Damon, I don't know what it is but I don't want him to have it
6930,Anna," I could ask her but you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us so why should I even bother?"
6931,Damon," Because you want to stay in Mystic Falls and John Gilbert's in town, making that impossible. Find out where it is. He leaves and you can buy your welcome mat"
6932,Elena, Thanks for helping me
6933,Jenna, Don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't gonna burn off
6934,Elena," You know I remember when my mom and I were first planning for this, she was excited"
6935,Jenna, So were you if I recall
6936,Elena, I was. She's made it sounded like something so much fun. Lots of things changed then
6937,Jenna, I hate to brake it to you but its little late for cold feet
6938,Elena, I don't have cold feet. It's just… I think I'd be enjoying a lot more if she was here
6939,Jenna," Well I tell you one thing, your hair would had better chance if she was"
6940,Elena," Okay, I should go put my dress on. Be careful with that thing, don't hurt anybody"
6941,John, You look miserable
6942,Jeremy, Are they really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?
6943,John, You could fight it if you want but it's part of being a Gilbert
6944,Jeremy," Yeah, you mentioned you know a lot about the family. You know anything about our ancestor Jonathan Gilbert?"
6945,John," Prolific writer, crazy inventor. Why do you ask?"
6946,Jeremy," Well, I read his journal"
6947,John, Is that right?
6948,Jeremy," Yeah, I actually found it in all dads' stuff"
6949,John," Well, it's surprising. Most of them are locked away"
6950,Jeremy, There are more of them?
6951,John," Jonathan Gilbert journaled his whole life. Right down his bedroom, insane, drunk and mad. The guy had a lot of demons"
6952,Jeremy, And did you read them?
6953,John," Leafed through, yeah"
6954,Jeremy, What did you think about what he wrote?
6955,John, Crazy ramblings of a mad man of course
6956,John, She's very pretty
6957,Jeremy," Yeah, uh she's a friend of mine. Excuse me"
6958,Elena, Are you okay Amber?
6959,Amber," I hate being the center of attention, I get panic attacks"
6960,Elena, You need some privacy so you can change?
6961,Amber, Actually I'm gonna go get some air
6962,Elena," Hey, you can't be back here"
6963,Damon, We need to talk
6964,Elena, It has to be right now?
6965,Damon," Normally I would have a completely different outlook of what I'm about to tell you but since it's really inconvenient to me, I'll squib"
6966,Elena, What are you talking about?
6967,Damon, Stefan's still drinking human bl*od
6968,Elena, What?!
6969,Damon," Yeah, a month ago I would have ajoiced but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to lose his mind"
6970,Elena, I know he's been a little edgy but he said that was normal
6971,Damon, He has a fridge full of stolen bl*od bank contraband in the house
6972,Elena, Oh my god
6973,Damon," He has no idea where normal is, his entire existence isn't normal. Normal to a vampire is drinking human bl*od but he spent all the time fighting it when he should have learn to control it and now it's controlling him instead"
6974,Elena," I can't believe it. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here"
6975,Damon," Stefan on human bl*od Elena; he'll do anything, he'll say anything because is not gonna want to stop. Trust me"
6976,Jeremy, Anna!
6977,Anna, What is it?
6978,Jeremy," Come on, don't be like that"
6979,Anna, Why not? You were basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you can be with someone else
6980,Jeremy," No, I wasn't using you"
6981,Anna, Really? And how would you like to define it?
6982,Jeremy," Look, I don't think it's any worse of becoming friends with me so you can give to your mother my bl*od"
6983,Anna, How do you know that?
6984,Jeremy, It's not important
6985,Anna," Seriously Jeremy, what do you know?"
6986,Jeremy," Everything, I know everything"
6987,Elena, This is all my fault; I'm the one who fed him to bl*od in the first place
6988,Stefan, What's going on in here?
6989,Damon, I was just filling Elena on your extra-curricular activities
6990,Stefan (laughing), What are you talking about?
6991,Elena, know about the bl*od Stefan
6992,Damon," I'll be downstairs, drinking"
6993,Stefan, I was going to tell you
6994,Elena, When?
6995,Stefan," I'm fine. I'm fine, the bl*od, it doesn't change anything"
6996,Elena, It's changing you
6997,Stefan," Why? Because I kept a secret from you? Come on Elena, look, giving the way you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?"
6998,Elena, Are you hearing yourself right now? You've been stealing bl*od and lying and you say that everything's fine? Everything's not fine Stefan!
6999,Stefan, So what's you and Damon all the sudden have everything figured out then?
7000,Elena, it‘s not about Damon. It's about what's happening to you
7001,Stefan, I know and I'm telling you that I'm fine. I'm fine. Please come on. Elena I thought you… I thought you believed in me
7002,Carole Lockwood," Elena, let's go. The line up's starting"
7003,Elena, I just… I need a minute
7004,Carole Lockwood, You're not even dressed yet. Escorts wait downstairs Stefan
7005,Amber," Oh my god, sorry!"
7006,Mayor Lockwood," Miss Tina Fell, escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore"
7007,Caroline Lockwood, Has anyone seen Amber?
7008,Elena (looking if she sees Stefan downstairs), Do you see Stefan down there?
7009,Caroline," Nope, just my boring fill in escort"
7010,Elena, What happened to Matt?
7011,Caroline, They wouldn't let him out of work and what happened to Stefan?
7012,Elena," I don't know, he just disappeared somewhere, I don't know. What am I doing? I never should have gone through this"
7013,Caroline, What do you mean?
7014,Elena," I need to find Stefan, this isn't me, I'm not this person anymore"
7015,Caroline," No, no, no way, no. You had your chance to drop out and believe me I was of for it because there was no way that I could b*at you. Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom"
7016,Mayor Lockwood, Miss Caroline Forbes and her escort Jeffrey Lockwood Hamilton
7017,Carol Lockwood," Elena, you're next"
7018,Anna, You're missing Elena's introduction
7019,Jeremy, I don't care
7020,Anna," So, she has no idea you read her journal?"
7021,Jeremy," She keeps things from me, I'm gonna keep things from her"
7022,Anna, What are you gonna do now? Now that you know everything she's been hiding from you?
7023,Jeremy," I don't know. There's a part of me that's so angry, you know, she has covered up what happened to Vicky and raised my memory but there's this other part of me that's glad. I… I don't want to remember Vicky like that"
7024,Anna, As a monster?
7025,Jeremy," No, as someone who wanted to hurt me"
7026,Anna," When I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back but then things changed… All the time we spent together… I would never do anything to hurt you, not now. You know that right?"
7027,Jeremy, Yeah I know that
7028,Amber, Where are we going?
7029,Stefan, I don't know
7030,Amber, I'm in the ceremony
7031,Stefan," No, now you're not"
7032,Stefan, You're standing in the parking lot with me
7033,Amber, I'm on the parking lot with you
7034,Stefan," I'm sorry. I'm not very good to be around right now, I'm a little bit on the edge. I've been drinking the human stuff and it's screwing with my head. She knows now. God! She wasn't supposed to found out, I didn't want her to found out, now everything's ruined"
7035,Amber, You seem sad
7036,Stefan, I'm not sad. I'm freaking hungry!
7037,Mayor Lockwood," Miss Elena Gilbert, escorted by Mister Stefan Salvatore"
7038,Elena, Where is Stefan?
7039,Damon, I don't know
7040,Jenna, What is she doing with Damon?
7041,Alaric, I have no idea
7042,Stefan," I don't hurt people, I don't do that, I'm the good brother"
7043,Amber, Do you want to hurt me?
7044,Stefan," I want to k*ll you, I want to rip into your skin and I want to feel on your bl*od"
7045,Stefan," Under your skin, pulsating, floating"
7046,Stefan," Your carotid artery right here. If you punch right you can control the bl*od flow. It takes practice but it doesn't have to make a mess, you don't have to waste any"
7047,Amber, What's stopping you?
7048,Stefan (still touching amber's face)," If I do this, if I give in, there's no going back"
7049,Amber, Then don't
7050,Stefan, I just want one taste; all I need is just one more taste
7051,Amber, One taste?
7052,Caroline, Where is Amber?
7053,Elena, I don't know
7054,Mayor Lockwood," Before I crown a winner, I'd like to offer a personal thank you to all of these young ladies for their efforts to better our community"
7055,Mayor Lockwood," So, without further due it is my honor to announce our very own Miss Mystic Falls, Miss Caroline Forbes!"
7056,Elena, Congratulations
7057,Caroline, I actually won
7058,John, There is bl*od on the glass
7059,Sheriff Forbes, Get me Stefan Salvatore
7060,Stefan, I can't do this
7061,Amber, What's the matter?
7062,Stefan, I can't do this
7063,Amber," It's okay, doesn't hurt that much, just not so hard next time"
7064,Stefan, Oh god oh god oh god! I can't stop
7065,Stefan, Why aren't you afraid of me?
7066,Amber, You told me not to be
7067,Stefan, What? What's your name?
7068,Amber, Amber
7069,Stefan," Listen to me Amber. I need you to be afraid of me. I need to run like hell do you understand me? Run, run now!"
7070,Elena," What is it, did you find him?"
7071,Damon, They were signs of struggling on the upstairs bathroom
7072,Damon, There was bl*od and that Amber girl is missing
7073,Elena," Oh my god! He wouldn't hurt her, he won't!"
7074,Damon, Let's just find him okay? Let's get your coat come on!
7075,Amber, You said to run!
7076,Stefan, I changed my mind
7077,Elena, Stefan!
7078,Damon," Stefan, come on get control. It's okay, come on. Breath through a bit"
7079,Elena, Stefan stop it!
7080,Damon, It's okay Stefan
7081,Sheriff Forbes, She doesn't remember what happened
7082,Damon," It's a good thing the girls got here before I did, she lost lot of bl*od"
7083,Sheriff Forbes (to Bonnie and Elena), You didn't see anything?
7084,Elena," No, we just found her and called Damon"
7085,Bonnie, Is she gonna be okay?
7086,Sheriff Forbes, It looks like it yeah. Why do you girls don't get back to the party? Damon and I can take it from here
7087,Elena, Okay
7088,Sheriff Forbes, They didn't see the bite mark?
7089,Damon," No, I got here before they got too close. There was too much bl*od, they couldn't see it clearly"
7090,Elena," Bonnie, can we talk about this?"
7091,Bonnie, There's nothing to talk about
7092,Elena, Bonnie please
7093,Bonnie, I told you I wasn't gonna make you choose but I need to make the choice for myself. Please just leave me alone
7094,Jenna," Jer, are you ready?"
7095,Jeremy, Just a sec
7096,John, Who's that girl with Jeremy?
7097,Jenna, His friend Anna
7098,John, What's her story?
7099,Jenna, why so nosy?
7100,John, I'm just curious; he really seems to like her
7101,Jenna," She's new in town I think. She and her mom Pearl, the family you're so rudely you try to prevent from buying Grayson's building"
7102,John (looking at Anna and Jeremy), Her mother's name is Pearl?
7103,Jenna," Yes, so?"
7104,John," Well, I believe I already know all about her"
7105,Alaric," Good, there you are. Jenna wants me to get the car"
7106,Alaric, What happened?
7107,Damon," Anna, this is getting weird"
7108,Anna, We're here to talk
7109,Damon," Not in the mood, today's been a no good, very bad day"
7110,Pearl, Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Jonathan Gilbert
7111,Damon, ‘m listening
7112,Damon, What is it?
7113,Pearl, Jonathan was passionate by his inventions. He confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element
7114,Damon, It was a pocket watch
7115,Pearl," That's what it turned out to be yes. But that's not what I stole. I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in Jonathan's hand, the night he took us, its stile pointed in me"
7116,Damon, So what is this?
7117,Pearl, I have no idea but now it's yours
7118,Damon, What's the catch?
7119,Pearl," There is no catch. My daughter wants to stay here, I want to stay here. You refused to trust us and for good reasons. Consider this an apology"
7120,Stefan, You shouldn't be here
7121,Elena, I know
7122,Stefan, Now you know
7123,Elena, That wasn't you
7124,Stefan," oh, it was absolutely me. A monster, a predator, that's who I am Elena"
7125,Elena, That's what the bl*od makes you
7126,Stefan, The bl*od brings out what's inside of me and if you think any differently then you're an idiot
7127,Elena, I know this isn't you Stefan
7128,Stefan, I wanted to drain every ounce of bl*od from that girl's body
7129,Elena, No
7130,Stefan, It's who I am Elena
7131,Elena," No, you can't scare me off"
7132,Stefan, Why would you risk it? Why would you come here?
7133,Elena," Because I did this, this is my fault; I'm the one who made you drink the bl*od"
7134,Stefan, All you did was expose me to who I really am
7135,Elena, It isn't you
7136,Stefan (screaming), Stop saying that!
7137,Stefan, Don't get any closer to me
7138,Elena, I'm not gonna let this happen to you
7139,Stefan, Stop
7140,Elena," Stefan, I'm not gonna give up on you! I believe in you!"
7141,Stefan, Stop!
7142,Stefan, Stop!
7143,Stefan, I'm so sorry
7144,Elena, It's okay
7145,Stefan, I don't know what's happening to me
7146,Elena," It's okay Stefan shut. Its okay, you're gonna be okay"
7147,Damon, Sure you want to do this?
7148,Elena, I'm sure
7149,Damon, There's no guarantee it's going to work
7150,Elena, It has to
7151,Damon, Coming? 
7152,Elena, I'm gonna stay here
7153,STEFAN," For over a century, I have lived in secret. Until now. I know the risk. But I have to know her."
7154,DAMON," Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine."
7155,STEFAN, I want you all to myself.
7156,KATHERINE," Just as he wants me, but I'm the one. Who gets to make all the rules."
7157,GIUSEPPE, Go get the sheriff. We have a vampire.
7158,STEFAN, No. Don't take her!
7159,GIUSEPPE, You'll be k*ll along with them.
7160,DAMON, Then let me be k*ll.
7161,STEFAN, Damn it. We'll get her back.
7162,DAMON, Don't you think that you've done enough?
7163,DAMON, Stefan's still drinking human bl*od.
7164,GIRL, Aah!
7165,ELENA, Stefan!
7166,DAMON, Stefan.
7167,STEFAN, bl*od brings out what's inside of me.
7168,ELENA," I'm not gonna give up on you, Stefan. I believe in you."
7169,STEFAN, Stop! Stop! Stop! I'm so sorry.
7170,ELENA, It's ok. You're gonna be ok.
7171,STEFAN, (to Damon)We have to get to the church. They're waiting. Circle around that way. I'll distract them. Go. (to men)Over here! There's another one! Quick! Help me!
7172,JONATHAN, Arm yourselves.
7173,STEFAN, We don't have long.
7174,DAMON, Katherine. Katherine.
7175,STEFAN," We're gonna get you out of here. Damon, hurry. Hurry."
7176,DAMON, Aah!
7177,STEFAN, No! No. Damon. Oh...
7178,MEN, Come on. Let's go.
7179,STEFAN, Uhh!
7180,DAMON, Stefan.
7181,ELENA, Stefan.
7182,KATHERINE/ELENA," I love you, Stefan."
7183,ELENA, It's so hard to see him locked up like this.
7184,DAMON, You're the one who locked him up.
7185,ELENA, You helped.
7186,DAMON," I couldn't have him running around chewing on people. While the town was looking for vampires, now, could I?"
7187,ELENA, It had nothing to do with you actually caring about him.
7188,DAMON," Your thing, not mine."
7189,EMILIE, Katherine had me make that for you weeks ago.
7190,STEFAN, Where am I?
7191,EMILIE, The quarry just north of town. My brother and I brought you here last night. We found you dead in the woods.
7192,STEFAN, Where's Damon? Am I... Am I a...
7193,EMILIE, Not yet. You're in transition.
7194,STEFAN, But how? I...
7195,EMILIE, You had Katherine's bl*od in your system when you died.
7196,STEFAN, No. I never...
7197,EMILIE," She's been compelling you to drink it for weeks, Stefan."
7198,STEFAN, And Damon?
7199,EMILIE, No compulsion was necessary. He drank from her willingly.
7200,DAMON," I woke up last night. I didn't know where I was. I went to the church. And I watched them drag her inside. Then they set fire to it. And the whole church went up into flames. They k*ll her, Stefan. She's gone."
7201,ELENA, Did you ever figure out what that is?
7202,DAMON," Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work."
7203,ELENA, Pearl didn't say anything else about it?
7204,DAMON," She thought she was stealing his vampire compass, but it was a pocket watch. That Johnathan Gilbert was a crazy scientist. Have you spoken to your uncle lately?"
7205,ELENA," I've been avoiding him, actually. That, and I've been here most nights."
7206,DAMON," So, you'll be here again tonight?"
7207,ELENA, Is that a problem?
7208,DAMON, Yes. You're a complete nuisance.
7209,ELENA, Heh. See you later.
7210,ANNA, Hey. Surprise.
7211,JEREMY, What are you doing here?
7212,ANNA, Picking up this.
7213,JEREMY, A class schedule?
7214,ANNA," Starting tomorrow, I'm officially a student here."
7215,JEREMY," You're kidding me, right?"
7216,ANNA, No. I finally b*at my mom down.
7217,JEREMY, Heh. But why would you want to go to high school? It blows.
7218,ANNA, Do I really need to answer that?
7219,JEREMY, You'd suffer through all this just to hang out with me?
7220,ANNA, Yeah. I would.
7221,JEREMY," That's, um..."
7222,ANNA, Stupid? Pathetic? Old lurky me?
7223,JEREMY, It's awesome. It's awesome.
7224,DAMON, Brought you something to eat...100% Stefan diet approved. You know what will happen if you don't eat. You'll get all rotting and crusty.
7225,STEFAN, I'm not hungry.
7226,DAMON, Of course you are. We're eternally hungry. Take it. The human bl*od should be gone by now. You want to explain why you're still in here. Feeling sorry for yourself? Come on. Drink up. Fine. Starve. What do I care?
7227,DAMON(at phone), Hello?
7228,ALARIC(at phone)," Hey, it's Alaric Saltzman."
7229,DAMON(at phone)," Before I hang up, how did you get this number?"
7230,ALARIC(at phone)," Ah, it's a mystery. Listen, I've, uh, been doing some digging on Elena's uncle. You interested?"
7231,DAMON(at phone), What kind of digging?
7232,ALARIC(at phone), I've got an old friend from Duke. Who studied criminology when we were there together. Let's just say he's become a very proficient digger.
7233,DAMON(at phone)," Well, did he find anything, by chance?"
7234,ALARIC(at phone)," Well, I had him run a track on John's cell records. He was getting a call from a number... The same number that Elena dialed to get Isobel. And then the number was disconnected. Isobel knows John."
7235,DAMON(at phone), Whatever. We knew that.
7236,ALARIC(at phone)," Right. Well, after that, he started getting calls from a new number. And I had my friend run a geotrack. Got the address. It's...It's an apartment in Grove Hill."
7237,DAMON(at phone), Isobel's in Grove Hill?
7238,ALARIC(at phone), I don't know. I thought we could take a look and see what we find.
7239,DAMON(at phone), Perfect. Give me the address.
7240,ALARIC(at phone)," Oh, so you can go without me? No. I don't think so."
7241,DAOMN(at phone), I'm not going with you. You tried to k*ll me.
7242,ALARIC(at phone)," Yeah, well, you did k*ll me."
7243,DAMON(at phone), Hold on.
7244,DAMON(at phone), What?
7245,ELENA(at phone)," I'm just grabbing some clothes, and then I'll be right over. How's Stefan?"
7246,DAMON(at phone), Extra broody. Hold on. (to Alaric)You drive. Pick me up in an hour.
7247,ALARIC(at phone), Done.
7248,DAMON(at phone), He won't eat anything.
7249,ELENA(at phone)," He has to ea what's his favorite... Kind of, um..."
7250,DAMON(at phone), His favorite kind of what?
7251,ELENA(at phone), Type of animal bl*od that he prefers?
7252,DAMON(at phone), Ew. Gross.
7253,ELENA(at phone), Heh. Your joking doesn't help.
7254,DAMON(at phone)," Helps me. Now, hurry up. I can't baby-sit all night. I have things to do."
7255,ELENA(at phone)," I would say, ""drop dead,"" but..."
7256,DAMON(at phone)," Ha ha. Stefan likes... Puppy bl*od... Little golden retriever puppies with cute, fluffy ears. That's his favorite."
7257,JOHN, Sorry.
7258,ELENA, Uncle John. I didn't see you there.
7259,JOHN, I thought we could talk. We haven't had a chance to catch up.
7260,ELENA," I'm actually just heading out, so..."
7261,JOHN," Well, it won't take long."
7262,ELENA, What did you want to talk about?
7263,JOHN, Well...I know you know.
7264,ELENA, Know what?
7265,JOHN, It's really silly to keep pretending. What do you think your mother would say. If she knew you were dating a vampire?
7266,ELENA, Which mother?
7267,STEFAN, I bet Johnathan Gilbert has told father by now. Wonder how he took the news that we're dead.
7268,DAMON, As if he cares. He betrayed us.
7269,STEFAN," He thought he was protecting us, Damon. He thought he was protecting this town."
7270,DAMON, God. This sun hurts my eyes.
7271,STEFAN," It's part of it. The muscle aches, the sick feeling...Emily says it's our bods pushing us to feed, to complete the transition."
7272,DAMON, That's not gonna happen.
7273,STEFAN," Is that your choice, then? To die instead?"
7274,DAMON, Isn't it yours? This was all to be with Katherine. But she's gone. I want it over.
7275,ELENA," How you feelin'? Damon says you need to drink that. You need it, Stefan. Can't survive without it."
7276,STEFAN, I don't want to survive.
7277,ELENA," What? No, don't say that."
7278,STEFAN," I'm sorry, Elena. No more. After what I've done, it has to end. I just want it over."
7279,DAMON, He's just being dramatic. He's not gonna starve himself.
7280,ELENA, Why would he say that?
7281,DAMON, He feels bad about hurting that girl. It's a very typical step of martyr stuff. It will pass.
7282,ELENA, Will it? Because he seemed to be in lot of pain.
7283,DAMON," Yeah. Well, that will pass, too, once he eats."
7284,ELENA, I didn't mean physical pain.
7285,DAMON," I know what you meant. Look, are you gonna be ok here if run out? I have to go to an errand with the teacher."
7286,ELENA, The teacher? Alaric? Are you two friends now?
7287,DAMON," I don't have any friends, Elena."
7288,ELENA, Right.
7289,DAMON," You should, um, you should stay up here. You shouldn't be down there by yourself."
7290,ELENA, I'll be fine.
7291,DAMON," You know... You're very trusting of him, given the circumstances."
7292,ELENA," So are you. Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving."
7293,DAMON, I won't be long.
7294,PEARL," Hello, Mr. Gilbert."
7295,JOHN," Pearl. What a pleasure. I must admit, I'm surprised that you came."
7296,PEARL, Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss the sale of the building in person.
7297,JOHN," Still, revealing yourself to me like this, it took quite a risk."
7298,PEARL," I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert. You knew who I was when you requested the meeting. So, Damon tells me that you're looking for the device I took from Johnathan. I'm sure you realize I have no intention of giving it to you."
7299,JOHN, That's why I wanted to meet you. I'm planning on changing your mind.
7300,PEARL, Really? How so?
7301,JOHN, With my Gilbert charm. I know that you have a weakness for it. May I buy you a drink?
7302,JEREMY," So, your mother was in love with Johnathan Gilbert, and he betrayed her?"
7303,ANNA, Yup.
7304,JEREMY, And now my uncle John wants this invention-device thing that she gave to Damon.
7305,ANNA, That's pretty much it.
7306,JEREMY, John mentioned there were more Gilbert journals. I bet that's how he knows everything.
7307,ANNA," Do we have to talk about ts all night? I've told you everything. I probably shouldn't have, 'cause that could get us both in a lot of trouble."
7308,JEREMY, I'm not gonna say anything.
7309,ANNA, Your uncle John wants us dead.
7310,JEREMY," Oh, you don't know that."
7311,ANNA," Yes, I do. He's a hater, Jeremy."
7312,JEREMY," Well, I'm not."
7313,ANNA, No. You're something else entirely.
7314,JEREMY," Oh, yeah? What would that be?"
7315,ANNA, My weakness.
7316,JEREMY, I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.
7317,ANNA, Jenna's in the kitchen. She just opened the refrigerator.
7318,JEREMY, Wait. You can hear that? That is so cool.
7319,ALARIC, This is the one here. The records show is was paid 3 months in advance.
7320,DAMON, This is where it gets tricky. I may or may not be able to get in.
7321,ALARIC," Yeah, how does that work? You always have to be invited in?"
7322,DAMON, By the owner or the person of entitlement. Short-term rentals and hotels are a bit of a gray area. You kind of gotta play it by ear.
7323,ALARIC," Heh. Could we not k*ll anyone tonight, please?"
7324,DAMON," You mean, you just brought me along for my company?"
7325,ALARIC," It doesn't look like anyone's home. Yeah. I'm good. No permanent resident, apparently."
7326,DAMON," Uh, Rick, we have company."
7327,DAMON," Boys, boys, that's enough. I know you."
7328,HENRY, Damon?
7329,DAMON, Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.
7330,HENRY," Yes, sir. What are you doing here?"
7331,GIUSEPPE," May I offer you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?"
7332,JONATHAN," Thank you, Mr. Salvatore."
7333,GIUSEPPE, This won't take much longer.
7334,JONATHAN, I want to make sure the founder's archives are accurate.
7335,GIUSEPPE, Be sure you document the loss of civilian life in the church.
7336,JONATHAN," They were hardly civilians, . Salvatore."
7337,GIUSEPPE," As far as anyone needs to know, they were. As the record keeper for the council, what you write will be passed down through generations. Certain details should be kept only between you and me."
7338,JONATHAN, For example?
7339,GIUSEPPE," My sons. They will be remembered the innocent v*ctim of the battle of willow creek, not for their shame."
7340,JONATHAN," Certainly, Mr. Salvatore."
7341,STEFAN," You know, Damon hasn't fed me vervain in a while. I could be at those bars in flash, and you'd be dead."
7342,ELENA," Yeah, you could. But you won't."
7343,STEFAN, Please just go away. I don't want you here.
7344,STEFAN, What are you doing? Get out of here.
7345,ELENA, No.
7346,STEFAN, You're taking a stupid risk. I could hurt you.
7347,ELENA, Then I'm stupid. You need to drink this.
7348,STEFAN," Elena, get out of here, or you'll regret it."
7349,ELENA, Drink.
7350,STEFAN, I said get out!
7351,ELENA, No.
7352,HENRY," So, how do you know John Gilbert?"
7353,DAMON," Well, I've known him for years. He's a good friend. How do you know him?"
7354,HENRY, I met him right after I got out of the tomb. He's been helping me
7355,ALARIC, Helping you out how?
7356,HENRY," Adapting. It's a whole new world... Cars, computers, match.com. There's so much to learn."
7357,ALARIC," So, do you live here alone or is there someone else here?"
7358,DAMON," That's my friend's very...Passive-aggressive way of asking, uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?"
7359,HENRY," Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel. I know John. He's my only real friend. He really showed me the ropes... how to use a microwave, separate my whites."
7360,ALARIC, What else do you do for him?
7361,HENRY," I help keep an eye on things...You know, with the others."
7362,DAMON, The others?
7363,HENRY," From the tomb. They're still pissed at the founding families for trying to burn them alive. I'm cool, but those tomb boys, they want revenge."
7364,ALARIC, What does John want with them?
7365,HENRY," He's just keeping an eye on them, you know? Trying to make sure they stay out of trouble."
7366,DAMON," Well, that's John. Heh. He's such a do-gooder."
7367,HENRY, Heh. That's John now.
7368,DAMON," Oh. Hey, let me talk to him. All right."
7369,HENRY, Yeah. Are you gonna answer that?
7370,DAMON, Am I gonna... answer that?
7371,HENRY, What's going on?
7372,HENRY, Uhh! Uhh! Aah!
7373,DAMON," ""Let's not not k*ll anyone tonight."" Your words. Just pointing that out."
7374,JOHN, My apologies.
7375,PEARL," No apologies necessary. So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why should I let you have the device?"
7376,JOHN," Because I can help you. I'm connected around here. The town council's eating out of my land. They do whatever I say. And I know that you just want to live your life. Complete with a white picket fence, and I can help you do that."
7377,PEARL, But the device doesn't work. Why would you even want it?
7378,JOHN, It's a family heirloom. Call me sentimental.
7379,PEARL, Johnathan was ahead of his time.
7380,JOHN," I read his journals. They're very extensive. He actually wrote about you. You were his one regret. He loved you, and he hated himself for what he did to you."
7381,PEARL, You're lying.
7382,JOHN," No. On his last days, he wrote how sorry he was. You were the only woman he ever loved. Good God. You vampires... you're so emotional. Johnathan Gilbert hated you. His only regret was that he didn't drive a stake through your heart himself."
7383,PEARL, I gave it to Damon.
7384,JOHN, What?
7385,PEARL," I gave your device to Damon. Why don't you ask him for it yourself? I'm sure he'd be delighted to give it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert, may you rot in hell."
7386,ELENA," Talk to me, Stefan. Why are you doing this?"
7387,STEFAN, I'm making the decision I should have made years ago.
7388,ELENA, What are you talking about?
7389,STEFAN, You have to feed in order to complete the transition.
7390,ELENA, I know that.
7391,STEFAN, It was a choice I shouldn't have made.
7392,GIUSEPPE, Dear God.
7393,STEFAN," Even in our death, you only feel shame?"
7394,GIUSEPPE, You're one of them now.
7395,STEFAN," No. Father, I came to say good-bye."
7396,GIUSEPPE, I watched you die.
7397,STEFAN, You were there when we were sh*t?
7398,GIUSEPPE, I pulled the trigger myself.
7399,STEFAN, You k*ll your own sons?
7400,GIUSEPPE, You were both dead to me the moment you sided with the vampires. I only thank God that your mother isn't alive to see the disgrace you've become.
7401,STEFAN," I haven't turned yet. I don't want to. I'm going to let myself die, father. Please."
7402,GIUSEPPE," Yes, you are."
7403,GIUSEPPE, Uhh!
7404,STEFAN," Father, I didn't mean to."
7405,GIUSEPPE, Get away from me.
7406,STEFAN," No, let me help you. Please."
7407,GIUSEPPE, Ohh. Ohh.
7408,STEFAN," Uhh. Uhh! Oh, God. What's happening to me?"
7409,STEFAN, How can you even look at me right now?
7410,ELENA," You need to be able talk about these things, Stefan. I need to hear them. Come upstairs. We can talk about it more, and we'll keep talking as long as you need."
7411,STEFAN, You're so sure I'm ready. And when you feel the same way... I'll be upstairs.
7412,DAMON, Find anything yet?
7413,ALARIC," No, I looked everywhere. The place is...The place is clean."
7414,DAMON," Well, I found this. Behind the bl*od in the fridge."
7415,ALARIC," Oh, man, this was a real dead-end."
7416,DAMON," I wouldn't b*at myself up over it, man. What did you think you were gonna find, huh? Isobel with a cigar and slippers?"
7417,ALARIC," Oh, man. I...I gotta stop this. I can't...I can't keep searching for her."
7418,DAMON, Really? After only 2 years? That's actually...Moderately healthy.
7419,ALARIC, What are you going on? 146?
7420,DAMON," Well, I figure the 200 mark is probably a good stopping point."
7421,ALARIC," Ahh. I mean, no answer is enough. I keep thinking I wanna kn why, when, you know, the precise moment. When my wife decided life with me wasn't enough."
7422,DAMON," She charmed me, your wife Isobel. She talked a good game, man. She was smart. She had this excitement in her eyes. I probably should have known there was something different about her, some tie to Katherine. There had to be some reason I didn't k*ll her."
7423,ALARIC," That's enough, Damon. I don't wanna hear anymore. I just don't want to waste any more of my life. Searching for answers that I really don't want. I'm through with Isobel. I...I'm done with all of this. Yeah."
7424,ANNA, Hey. What's the matter?
7425,PEARL, I need you to pack your things. We're leaving.
7426,ANNA, What? No.
7427,PEARL, I was wrong to think that we could make a home here. It's time for us to move on.
7428,ANNA, But I don't want to move on. I want to stay.
7429,PEARL, We can't stay. There's too many people here who know the truth... Too much history.
7430,ANNA," So, what, you're just gonna give up, pack us up, and move us out?"
7431,PEARL, It's not safe here. You know that.
7432,ANNA, Please.
7433,PEARL, This is about Jeremy.
7434,ANNA," No. It's about me. Finally getting to build a life for myself. Please, mama."
7435,PEARL, You gave me my life back. I am just trying to protect yours. I can't force you. It's your decision.
7436,DAMON, Ugh. God. You're still here?
7437,ELENA, Were you expecting anything else?
7438,DAMON, No. Ahh.
7439,ELENA," So, how was the ""errand""?"
7440,DAMON," Futile. Although, I think I witnessed the teacher having an existential crisis. Has Stefan eaten yet?"
7441,ELENA, I thought you didn't care.
7442,DAMON, Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.
7443,ELENA, I think he's getting there. But he's got a lot of guilt that he has to deal with. And it doesn't help that you've spent the last 145 years punishing him for Katherine getting caught.
7444,DAMON, This is my fault now?
7445,ELENA," No, it's no one's fault, Damon. I'm just... saying you're not exactly innocent. You've made it your life's mission to make him miserable."
7446,DAMON," Let me ask you a question. In all this important soul-searching and cleansing of the demons of Stefan's past, did you ever manage to get e rest of the story?"
7447,ELENA, He said there was more.
7448,DAMON, Yeah. That's an understatement.
7449,ELENA, Damon...Damon. Tell me.
7450,DAMON, What are you doing? Who is that?
7451,STEFAN," I brought her for you. She's a gift. Have a seat, please."
7452,DAMON," What have you done, Stefan?"
7453,STEFAN," Damon, I've been to see father. He came at me. I didn't know my own strength. There was bl*od everywhere. He was dying, and the bl*od was too strong. I needed it. I had to have it."
7454,DAMON, You fed.
7455,STEFAN," Yes. And it's incredible. My body is exploding with power, Damon."
7456,DAMON, No.
7457,STEFAN," I can hear things from far away. I can see through the darkness. I can move, like it's magic. And the guilt, the pain...Damon, I can turn it off. Like a switch. Katherine was right. It's a whole another world out there, Damon."
7458,DAMON," Katherine is dead, Stefan. There's no world without her."
7459,STEFAN," No. You can turn that off, too. You don't have to feel that pain anymore."
7460,DAMON, I don't want it.
7461,STEFAN, You're weak. You'll be dead soon. You need this.
7462,DAMON, No.
7463,STEFAN, You'll die.
7464,DAMON, No. I can't.
7465,STEFAN, Please. I won't let you die.
7466,DAMON, No. I can't.
7467,STEFAN, Don't fight it. We can do this... together.
7468,DAMON," From the moment Stefan had his first taste of human bl*od, he was a different person. I suppose I should thank him. It's been a hell of a ride. Heh."
7469,ELENA," Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die. That's why he wot feed. Now I understand why, but..."
7470,DAMON," His choice. If he's stupid enough to make it, so be it."
7471,ELENA, Don't do that. Ok? Don't pretend like you don't care.
7472,DAMON, Where are you going?
7473,JEREMY, Hey.
7474,ANNA, It's getting impossible to sneak up on you.
7475,JEREMY," Nice try, though."
7476,ANNA, Sorry I woke you.
7477,JEREMY, That's ok. You only woke me halfway.
7478,ANNA," So, listen. I..."
7479,JEREMY, That feels good.
7480,ANNA, Good-bye.
7481,STEFAN, How do you feel?
7482,DAMON, You were right. It is a whole new world.
7483,STEFAN, We can explore it together.
7484,DAMON," You got what you wanted...You and me for all eternity. But here it is, brother. I will make it an eternity of misery for you."
7485,STEFAN, Damon!
7486,EMILIE, You've transitioned.
7487,STEFAN, You'd have rather found me dead?
7488,EMILIE, Katherine saved my life once. I owed her. That doesn't mean I'd wish her curse on anyone.
7489,STEFAN, It feels more like a gift.
7490,EMILIE, That will change.
7491,STEFAN, Why is that?
7492,EMILIE," Because even in death, your heart is pure, Stefan. I sense that about you. That will be your curse."
7493,STEFAN," Emily, wait."
7494,ELENA, Stefan. Damon told me the rest of the story. I thought I might find you here.
7495,STEFAN," I should have died that night, just like I had chosen. I should have let Damon die, too."
7496,ELENA," But you didn't. And if you die now, it's not gonna change what happened."
7497,STEFAN," Every single person that's been hurt...Every single life that's been lost, it's because of me."
7498,ELENA," The night that my parents died...I blew off family night so that I could go off to some party. I ended up getting stranded, and they had to come pick me up. That's why we ended up in the car at Wickery bridge. And that's why they died. Our actions are what set things in motion. But we have to live with that."
7499,STEFAN," I made a choice, Elena. And because of that choice, a lot of people were hurt."
7500,ELENA," You also made a choice to stop, to reject the person that the bl*od made you. You made a choice to be good, Stefan."
7501,STEFAN, No. Please don't do that.
7502,ELENA, That's the person who jumped in the water to save the family whose car had driven off the bridge.
7503,STEFAN, Please. Don't make this all ok.
7504,ELENA, That's the person who saved my life.
7505,STEFAN," You don't understand, Elena."
7506,ELENA, Then tell me.
7507,STEFAN," It hurts me. It hurts me, knowing what I've done, and that pain...That pain is with me all the time. And every day, I think that if I just...If just give myself over to the bl*od, I can make that pain stop. It would be that easy, and every day, I fight that. And I am so terrified that one day, I'm not gonna want to fight that anymore, Elena. And the next time I hurt somebody...It could be you."
7508,ELENA, There will be no next time.
7509,STEFAN, You don't know that.
7510,ELENA," Maybe I don't. But what I do know. Is that you can take this, throw it in the quarry, and let the sun rise. Or you could take this ring and put it on and keep fighting."
7511,ELENA, It's your choice.
7512,STEFAN, Elena.
7513,PEARL," Thank you, Harper."
7514,HARPER, You're welcome
7515,PEARL," Annabelle should be back in a minute. You know, you don't have to come with us if you don't want to."
7516,HARPER," This was never my home, miss pearl. I was just a soldier who was left to die. You saved me. I'm coming with you."
7517,PEARL, Let me help you with these.
7518,ELENA," I'll be upstairs, OK?"
7519,STEFAN, Ok.
7520,ELENA," Good night, Damon."
7521,STEFAN, Thank you.
7522,DAMON," No, Stefan, thank you. You're back on Bambi bl*od, and I'm the big badass brother again. All is right in the world."
7523,STEFAN, I mean it. Thank you. For... helping her take care of me.
7524,DAMON," You brood too much. Everything on this planet is not your fault. My actions, what I do, it's not your fault. I own them. They belong to me. You are not allowed to feel my guilt."
7525,STEFAN, Do you feel guilt?
7526,DAMON," If I wanted to, it's there. Emily waited till after I turned to tell me she'd been successful in protecting Katherine with her spell. She didn't want me to know about the tomb. She thought it would impact my decision."
7527,STEFAN, She didn't want either one of us to turn. She said it was a curse.
7528,DAMON, Witches...Judgy little things.
7529,STEFAN, Why didn't you tell me?
7530,DAMON," 'Cause I didn't want you to know. 'Cause I hated you, and I still do."
7531,STEFAN, I know.
7532,DAMON, But not because you forced me to turn.
7533,STEFAN, Then why?
7534,DAMON," Because she turned you. It was just supposed to be me, Stefan... Just me."
7535,JOHN(at phone)," Sheriff Forbes, John Gilbert. Sorry to call so late. I have an update about the vampires."
7536,ISOBEL," Hello, Rick."
7537,ALARIC, Isobel.
7538,Isobel, It's good to see you. You look good. I hear that you're a high school history teacher? How is that?
7539,Alaric," Where have you been, Isobel?"
7540,Isobel, I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you. I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you. I wanted this
7541,Alaric, It's that simple?
7542,Isobel," Yeah. You were supposed to mourn me, and move on"
7543,Alaric," You were my wife, and I loved you. How could I not search for you?"
7544,Isobel," Because I wasn't lost, Ric"
7545,Isobel, I understand that you know my daughter Elena and I hear that she's been looking for me. So…
7546,Isobel, I want you to arrange for a meeting with us
7547,Alaric, You want me to deliver a message?
7548,Isobel (she smiles), yeah
7549,Alaric, Screw you. You selfish bitch!
7550,Alaric, What do you want from me?
7551,Isobel, I told you
7552,Alaric, I'm not gonna do anything for you
7553,Isobel, You better tell Elena that I want to meet or I'm gonna start k*ll the citizens of this town one by one and I'm gonna start with your history students. Got it?
7554,Elena, I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic falls float for the founder's day parade. If I don't I get the rad with Caroline but I wanted to check in first
7555,Damon," I'm doing great, thanks for asking"
7556,Elena, Checking on Stefan
7557,Damon, Oh him? He's terrible
7558,Elena, What's the matter?
7559,Damon," He's just back to boring, straight-laced, off the junk. You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality"
7560,Elena, Don't forget who helped me
7561,Damon, I hate myself. Did uncle john mention anything about my field trip with the history teacher?
7562,Elena, No. I'm still avoiding him. Why? What's he up to?
7563,Damon, I don't know. But I'd love if you could find out for me
7564,Elena, I've got to go I'm late
7565,Damon," Have fun with the mystic queen, I know I did"
7566,Damon, Elena called
7567,Alaric, So these are the expects from the history department. For the founder's day float we'll be recreating the battle of willow creek. Tyler has been nominated at the head of the production design
7568,Tyler, By whom?
7569,Alaric, By me. I've seen your sketches and they're good
7570,Tyler, I'm not really into the…
7571,Alaric," Well, you just pick your team, be creative and… (He sees Elena and Stefan) don't screw up "
7572,Tyler, Great! (To Matt): You want to help me out with this?
7573,Matt, Not really no
7574,Elena, Hey mister Saltzman
7575,Alaric, Come with me. We need to talk
7576,Bonnie, Alright show me
7577,Caroline, Let's reference last year Miss Mystic float
7578,Caroline, This is what they did last year (She turns her computer and sow a picture to Bonnie) and this is exactly what we don't want to do
7579,Bonnie," So, what are we doing?"
7580,Caroline, Southern classic elegance
7581,Bonnie, Gone with the Wind?
7582,Caroline, How'd you know?
7583,Bonnie," You channel Scarlett, daily"
7584,Caroline, So true!
7585,Caroline, Where's Elena? She's supposed to be helping
7586,Bonnie, I don't know
7587,Caroline," Okay, what's the deal?"
7588,Bonnie, What do you mean?
7589,Caroline, Don't play dumb. You and Elena are fighting. Spill!
7590,Bonnie, It's nothing
7591,Caroline," It's not nothing. You know this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting. Matt and Tyler hate each other, you and Elena are on the out and I don't like it! And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong"
7592,Bonnie, I can't talk about it. Caroline I'm sorry
7593,Alaric," Damon, thanks for coming"
7594,Damon, Sorry I'm late. My dog ate my uh… never mind. 
7595,Damon, What are all the frown brows?
7596,Alaric, I saw Isobel last night
7597,Damon, Isobel is here? In town?
7598,Isobel, You're late
7599,John, I didn't realize there was a schedule. What's with the side show?
7600,Isobel, Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn. And I got the cow boy in a gay rodeo in Amarillo
7601,John, He's gay?
7602,Isobel," Not right now, he's really good to me (To the men and the women) Hey Cherie? Cassez vous! "
7603,Isobel, I'm teaching them French. Oh! I can smell the judgment coming out of you
7604,John," Well, they're people Isobel and you're treating them like dolls"
7605,Isobel, If we're gonna be partners you really have to stop being such a hater
7606,John, We're in a partnership together because we share a mutual goal. Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle
7607,Isobel," My lifestyle? So, I assume that you still don't have the invention"
7608,John, I'll get it. I said I would
7609,Isobel," uh, you threatened to expose Damon Salvatore that didn't work. You k*ll that Pearl lady, still no invention. I really don't think that you're plan is working John"
7610,John," Well, you being here is not going to help anything"
7611,Isobel, You failed john. I'm gonna take care from here
7612,Damon, Did you ask her about Uncle John? Are they working together? 
7613,Alaric, No
7614,Damon, No they're not?
7615,Alaric, No I didn't ask
7616,Damon, What about the invention?
7617,Alaric, Didn't ask
7618,Damon, Did she know about the tomb vampires?
7619,Alaric, I don't know
7620,Damon, Did words completely escape you? 
7621,Alaric," No, I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions"
7622,Damon, What did she want?
7623,Elena," She wants to see me, Damon"
7624,Stefan, Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting. We don't know why or what she wants
7625,Damon (still looking at Elena), You don't have to see her if you don't want to
7626,Elena, I don't really have choice
7627,Alaric, She's threatening to going k*ll spree
7628,Damon, Oh! I take that's not okay with you guys
7629,Elena, I want to do it. I want to meet her. If I don't I know I'll regret it
7630,Elena," Can you hear me? Thanks for coming, I'm nervous"
7631,Elena, I'm happy that you're here. I love you
7632,Isobel," Hello Elena. You look just like her, that's eerie"
7633,Elena, You've met Katherine?
7634,Isobel, She found me after I turned. Genetic curiosity I suppose. She would be fascinated by you
7635,Elena, Is that how you can walk in the day?
7636,Isobel, Katherine helped me obtain that
7637,Elena, Who's my father?
7638,Isobel, Not important. He was a teenage waste of space
7639,Elena, A name would be nice
7640,Isobel," It would, wouldn't it? You ask a lot of questions"
7641,Elena, Why did you compel that man to k*ll himself? Right after he told me to stop looking for you
7642,Isobel, Dramatic impact. I wish it would be more effective
7643,Elena, Human life means that little to you?
7644,Isobel, Means nothing to me. It's just a part of being what I am
7645,Elena," No it's not. I know other vampires, that's not true"
7646,Isobel, Your new boyfriend over there by the pool table? Stefan Salvatore. Why Stefan? Why you didn't go for Damon? Or are you enjoying them both like Katherine did?
7647,Damon, We should be in there
7648,Alaric," No, Isobel made it clear we're going to step a foot inside"
7649,Damon, I'm not going to k*ll her in a crowd restaurant
7650,Alaric, You're not going to k*ll her period! 
7651,Damon, She ruined your life and you still want to protect her?
7652,Alaric, She's my wife (Damon looks at him) was my wife. I looked for the woman I married but she wasn't there. The woman over there is just cold and unattached
7653,Damon," Yeah, she's just given up her humanity"
7654,Alaric," you see I don't get that. Stefan has his humanity, he's a good guy. And you're a dick and you k*ll people but I still see something in you. But with her there was… nothing."
7655,Damon," You can turn it off, like a button you can press. I mean, Stefan's different. He wants the whole human experience. He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother, so he shuts his feelings out. The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel. Isobel chose the easier road — no guilt, no shame, no regret. I mean, come on, if you could turn it off, wouldn't you?"
7656,Alaric, You haven't
7657,Damon, Of course I have Rick. It's why it's so fun to be around
7658,Elena, Why did you want to meet me? Can't be just to catch up
7659,Isobel, Because I was curious about you. But the real reason is: I want what you're uncle wants. Jonathan Gilbert's invention.
7660,Elena, How did you know my uncle?
7661,Isobel, I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger. John had a crush on me for years. He was the first one that told me about vampires 
7662,Elena, So what made you want to be one?
7663,Isobel, A very long list of reasons Elena. All of it I'm sure you've thought about
7664,Elena, No
7665,Isobel," That was your first lie. It's inevitable, you're going to get old Stefan won't. (Elena looks at Stefan. He seems sad).Forever doesn't last very long when you're human"
7666,Elena, I'm sorry but I don't have what you're looking for
7667,Isobel, Sit down (Stefan is going towards them) and tell your boyfriend to walk away. I want the invention
7668,Elena, I don't have it
7669,Isobel, I know that but Damon does and you're going get it for me
7670,Elena, He's not going to give it to me
7671,Isobel, Then the bl*od will be on your hands
7672,Isobel, It was nice meeting you Elena
7673,Jeremy, Hey Anna. Where are you? What's up? Uh… Give me a call when you get this
7674,Jenna," How is Anna? I like that girl, she has fire"
7675,Jeremy, I don't know. She won't return my call
7676,John, Girls trouble?
7677,Jeremy," No, no trouble. Anna just owes me a call, that's all"
7678,John, Is that the girl that I show you at the founder's pageant? You two are getting hot and heavy. When was the last time you saw her?
7679,Jeremy, Why?
7680,John, I was just making conversation. No one else in this house likes me. At least I can talk to you especially if you need someone to talk to about girls
7681,Jenna, Oh please! I'm eating
7682,John," So seriously, how well do you know Anna?"
7683,Jeremy, I know Anna extremely well
7684,John," I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. I'm here to answer any questions that you have, to help you in any way I can"
7685,Jeremy, Why?
7686,John, Because your dad would want me too
7687,Jeremy, I'm good
7688,Damon," Oh Oh Cherie, you won again. I hope I'm wearing my good underwear"
7689,Isobel," And it's just one blast from the past after another. No, no, no"
7690,Isobel, Degage Cherie 
7691,Damon, It's good to see you Isobel. I was just having fun with your little mignon
7692,Isobel, How did you find me?
7693,Damon, Search for the neighborhood bank closures and found the most expensive one 
7694,Isobel, Oh I should have known. You're the one who taught me that. What are you really doing here?
7695,Damon," Well you caused quite a stub when you blew into town. So, everyone except me were a little hurt"
7696,Isobel, I'm so sorry. Did you bring the device?
7697,Damon, What are you doing with John Gilbert? 
7698,Isobel, We dated a few times when we were young. He was a little bit in love with me
7699,Damon," I'm sure. One of the many. Now, this little invention what do you want with it?"
7700,Isobel," Oh, me personally? I don't want anything with it. I'm just doing what I'm told. You know Damon we are one the same side"
7701,Damon, Oh yeah? What side is that?
7702,Isobel, Katherine's. she wants John Gilbert to have the device and I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants
7703,Damon, Why are you doing her dirty work?
7704,Isobel, Don't k*ll the messenger. We both know that you can't control Katherine. She does what she wants
7705,Damon, So do I
7706,Isobel, Oh really Damon? You do? What we should do know?
7707,Damon," Now that I have your attention, listen up. You do not come into my town; threaten the people I care about. Going after Elena? Bad move. You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits because I do believe in k*ll the messenger. You know why? Because it sends a message. Katherine wants something from me? You tell that little bitch to come get it herself"
7708,Elena, Hey
7709,Bonnie, Hey. I couldn't sleep last night. You were obviously upset about something and I just walked away. It's not me. That can't be us. You're my friend Elena. If you need me I'm here for you and I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday
7710,Elena, I met my birth mother
7711,Bonnie, Oh. Was it... Are you okay?
7712,Tyler, Hey man. So Caroline told me you've been on your own for the past two weeks. Is everything okay?
7713,Matt," You're asking me about my mom. Seriously? Look, why don't you just give her a call to know when she goes back to town?"
7714,Tyler," Dude, that's not what I meant okay? I'm just trying to… I don't know what to say"
7715,Matt," Good men, don't say anything. You're a dick, end of the story"
7716,Tyler, I know (Matt leaves) whatever
7717,Bonnie, Hey! Thanks for meeting me. I wanted you to see this 
7718,Elena, Is that Emily's spell book?
7719,Bonnie, I've been going through it since grams died. Check this out
7720,Elena, That's the vampire compass
7721,Bonnie," Yeah, according to Emily, Jonathan Gilbert never actually succeeded in inventing anything. Emily secretly spelled them all with magic. Compass, rings and the mystery device you told me about"
7722,Elena," Yeah that's it. Well, a part of it. Damon only has one piece"
7723,Bonnie, Emily preached her loyalty to Katherine. But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get k*ll. This was the only way she could think of to help. To let Jonathan Gilbert believe that he'd actually invented these devices 
7724,Elena, That it say what it does?
7725,Bonnie, Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
7726,Elena, Yeah I'm sure. Why?
7727,Bonnie, This is a w*apon against vampires
7728,Jeremy, Elena!
7729,Elena," Hey, have you seen Stefan? I need to find him"
7730,Jeremy," No, not lately. Listen, do you have a second?"
7731,Elena, Yeah. What's up? What's going on?
7732,Jeremy," Well, it's Anna. I've left her all this messages but she hasn't answer back to me, not even a text"
7733,Elena, Anna? I didn't know that you guys were still friends
7734,Jeremy," We're more than friends. Look, something could be seriously wrong and if you know anything you've got to tell me"
7735,Elena," I haven't talk to her, Jer"
7736,Jeremy, Are you lying to me right now?
7737,Elena, Why do you say that?
7738,Jeremy," ‘Cause that's what you do. Lying. You lie about everything. I know what Anna is and I know that you know. So tell me, do you have any idea where she is?"
7739,Elena," No, but Jer… Jeremy wait!"
7740,Elena, Isobel. What are you doing here?
7741,Isobel, I'm your mother Elena. I want to be more involved in your life
7742,Elena, I don't want you in my life
7743,Isobel, I understand that. You've already have a lot of people that you care about but I've been studying. Let's see if I got this right.
7744,Isobel," There is the witchy best friend, Bonnie. Gonna stay away from that one"
7745,Isobel, oh… sad little brother Jeremy
7746,Isobel, And there's Caroline… upknocious Caroline. I got all of my info from her by the way. She had no idea who I was and she wouldn't stop piping. Oh…
7747,Isobel," And there's Matt, friend, ex piapy future ex. Lots of connection there"
7748,Elena, Matt is not involved in this
7749,Isobel, He's involved with you isn't he? 
7750,Elena," Look, you shouldn't be here. You need to leave"
7751,Isobel," No, I have some friends here too. Look, you see that man over here, standing next to Matt by the Float? His name is frank, he's very handsome and he's also quite handy and he'd noticed that the aces are rusted which is very dangerous. So, all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure and…"
7752,Elena, No!
7753,Matt, get this trailer! Come on guys help me!
7754,Stefan," Caroline, call an ambulance "
7755,Elena, Why are you doing this?
7756,Isobel, I show you how easy it is to hurt the people that you care about
7757,Elena, And you're doing this just because Jonathan Gilbert's invention?
7758,Isobel, End it over and all we'll be stop
7759,Elena," I told you, Damon is not giving it to me"
7760,Isobel, I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you
7761,Elena, He'll k*ll you before he gives it up
7762,Isobel, Is that before or after I k*ll your brother Jeremy?
7763,Elena, Jeremy?
7764,Elena, Jeremy?!
7765,Caroline, The ambulance is saying in 15-20 minutes
7766,Tyler, I have my car. I can take him to the hospital 
7767,Matt, Caroline can take me
7768,Caroline, I didn't drive
7769,Matt, I'll wait. Its fine
7770,Caroline," You will not wait okay?! You need to see a doctor, Tyler is driving. End of story"
7771,Tyler, I'll get my car
7772,John, I see you're packing. It's a good sign 
7773,Isobel, It won't be long now
7774,John, Did you get the missing piece? Where is it?
7775,Isobel, I don't have it yet
7776,John," Then, why did you call me there?"
7777,Isobel, Because I have the next best thing
7778,John, What the hell are you doing?
7779,Isobel, Getting what I want
7780,John, Yeah but he is my nephew and you're going let him go right this second!
7781,Isobel," That goddy ring on your finger, comes off"
7782,John," Come on Isobel, I know you okay? It's me John. You can't hurt a kid"
7783,Isobel, I'll k*ll him to prove you're wrong
7784,John," Really? Are you that far gone? Look, I know you've changed but the old Isobel is somewhere in there isn't she? Come on let him go"
7785,Isobel (to her mignons), Faites le souffrir 
7786,Isobel, Nice try. We'll see how you do without this
7787,Bonnie, Where is the device?
7788,Stefan, Damon has it. He's going to be difficult to resonate
7789,Elena," We'll go to him, I'll talk to him"
7790,Stefan," He's not just gonna end it over, especially if it's harm for the vampires"
7791,Elena, What if it's not?
7792,Damon, Absolutely not
7793,Elena, Hear me out
7794,Damon, I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she could give it to John who is going to turn it to k*ll me. I like being a living dead person
7795,Elena," But it would be useless, Bonnie can take its power away"
7796,Damon, I don't trust her
7797,Bonnie, I can remove the original spell
7798,Elena, Jenna and Isobel will never know
7799,Damon," No, I'll get Jeremy in my own way"
7800,Stefan, Really? How are you going to do that? Because Isobel is a vampire and Jeremy could be dead the second you walk in the door
7801,Damon (to Bonnie)," Are you even up for this? I mean no offense, you're not Emily Bennet. Emily knew what she was doing"
7802,Bonnie, I've been practicing
7803,Damon, It's not piano lessons honey
7804,Bonnie, What's your favorite book?
7805,Damon, What?
7806,Bonnie," Name a book, any book"
7807,Damon," Name a book… How about ""Call of the wild"" Jack London"
7808,Damon, Jack London
7809,Elena, We're doing this Damon. I'm gonna do it in my way. Now give me the device. We're wasting time!
7810,Damon (To Bonnie)," I don't trust you, I tried to k*ll you"
7811,Bonnie," You're right, you can't trust me"
7812,Elena, But you can trust me
7813,Elena, Thank you
7814,Jeremy, Here you go (He gives him the towel) 
7815,John, Thank you
7816,Jeremy, What is she after?
7817,John," Your ancestor invented a w*apon, a device that is extremely harmful to the vampires and we've been trying to get it"
7818,Jeremy, Why?
7819,John, Because there's a group of vampires from a long time ago and they want revenge on this town
7820,Jeremy, But why would a vampire help you k*ll other vampires?
7821,John," She has her own reasons for wanting them dead. Look Jeremy, no one ever thought vampires would return to this town. Not in modern times, but they have and we have to destroy them"
7822,Jeremy," All of them? No, there are some good ones out there"
7823,John, They're not such things
7824,Jeremy, I don't believe that
7825,John," Well, your dad did. And has his son that should mean something to you"
7826,Jeremy, How does my father knew about all this?
7827,John, Who do you think told me about the family history? 
7828,Bonnie, Done
7829,Damon," Great, now what?"
7830,Elena, Now we give it to Isobel
7831,Isobel, Where is the device?
7832,Elena, Where is my brother?
7833,Isobel, This is not a negotiation. Where is the invention?
7834,Elena, where is my brother?
7835,Isobel, Do you really think that I came alone?
7836,Elena, Do you think that I came alone?
7837,Isobel, For god sakes call home
7838,Elena, What?
7839,Isobel, Call home and ask to speak to your brother Jeremy
7840,Jeremy, allo? 
7841,Elena," Jeremy, are you okay?"
7842,Jeremy," yeah yeah I'm fine, Uncle John hit his head. It was an accident "
7843,Jenna, We're all laughing 
7844,Jeremy, But yeah I'm okay 
7845,Elena, I'll be home soon alright?
7846,Jeremy, Yeah 
7847,Elena, You would never gonna hurt him
7848,Isobel," No, I was going to k*ll him"
7849,Isobel, Don't look for any redeeming qualities in me. I don't have any
7850,Elena, But you took a risk with Damon. How did you know that he was gonna give it to me?
7851,Isobel, Because he's in love with you
7852,Elena (long pause), Thank you
7853,Isobel, For what?
7854,Elena, For being such a monumental disappointment. It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact
7855,Isobel," Goodbye, Elena. As long as you have a Salvatore on each arm, you're doomed. Katherine was smart. She got out. But we all know that you're not Katherine"
7856,Elena, Jeremy we need to talk about all this
7857,Jeremy," No, we really don't"
7858,Elena, I don't know what Anna told you but there things you need to know
7859,Jeremy, Yeah? Because I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it
7860,Elena, you read my journal?
7861,Jeremy, And save me the speech about invasion of privacy because I read a section about Damon racing my memory about what happened to Vicky
7862,Elena," Jeremy, please, you don't understand. The night that Vicky died, it was like mom and dad died all over again. It was all over your face and it hurt so much to see you like this. I just wanted to take away your pain. I'm so sorry"
7863,Jeremy, Get out!
7864,Elena, No Jeremy
7865,Jeremy, Elena! Just get out! Please
7866,Elena," Jeremy, please…"
7867,Alaric, What do you want?
7868,Isobel," I totally get it, you, here as an history teacher. It's good"
7869,Alaric, What the hell are you doing? You act like you don't care but yet you're here hunting me down
7870,Isobel, I'm leaving. I just thought I said goodbye
7871,Alaric, It haven't bother you the first time so why now?
7872,Isobel, You hate me. Good
7873,Alaric, Does it make it easier for you? I mean what is the whole point of this exercise?
7874,Isobel, What did you expect? You spent all this time trying to track me down. What do you think you would find?
7875,Alaric, The woman who gave me this (He shows her the ring). I mean you act like you don't care but you care enough to protect me after you're left 
7876,Isobel, I was a different person back then
7877,Alaric," Right! And that person is gone. The woman that I married, the woman I loved, she's just… she's gone"
7878,Alaric, You expect me to believe that?
7879,Isobel, What are you doing?
7880,Alaric," Well, I'm ring free, I'm vervain free. So, k*ll me or compel me because I don't believe it. Not for a second"
7881,Isobel," I wanted this, I needed this and I'm going to regret it forever. This was my mistake, not yours"
7882,Isobel," You're not going to remember this. I left you, I did and when I'm think about what I gave up it hurts. But now your heart is free of me, it's easier this way. Goodbye Rick"
7883,Jeremy, Anna? What are you doing here?
7884,Anna (crying), my mother. She's dead
7885,Jeremy, What?
7886,Anna, She was k*ll
7887,Jeremy, Oh my god Anna. Hey I'm so sorry
7888,Anna, I know I'm not supposed to be here but I don't have anywhere else to go
7889,Jeremy, It's okay
7890,Damon," Would you like one? Say it, whatever I is purge, get it out"
7891,Stefan, It's about what Isobel said
7892,Damon, What about?
7893,Stefan," Well, I know Elena and you have bounded and I know she cares about you and… I know you care about her"
7894,Damon," Well, this is going in an interesting direction"
7895,Stefan, I'm just concerned about Elena being hurt. She considers you a friend
7896,Damon," Same here, Elena is a very good friend. Actually, she might qualifies my only… friend. Is that a problem?"
7897,Stefan," So, at the risk of sounding like uh… like a jealous boyfriend"
7898,Damon," Oh, there's no risk, you do "
7899,Stefan, History won't be repeating itself where Elena is concerned. Do you understand what I'm saying?
7900,Damon, Sure
7901,Stefan, Do you understand?
7902,Damon," Whatever you say man, I mean we're just friends and as a friend I wasn't looking forward to tell her the truth anyway so I let you do it"
7903,Stefan, What truth?
7904,Damon, About John. Because I know you guys don't like to keep secrets from each other
7905,Stefan, What are you talking about?
7906,Damon," Am I the only one around here who has the ability to put everything together? Isobel! Hello? She dated John when she was 15; she gets pregnant and ends up in the doctor's office of John's brother. Now, what do you think John's role is in all this? I mean, go ahead, and think about it, I'm waiting. Did you get it? Is there in?"
7907,Stefan, So you think that John is Elena's father?
7908,Damon," Ding, ding, ding!"
7909,Stefan, what proof do you have?
7910,Damon," I don't need any proof, that's a DNA test for John, Elena and the crazy one to do it but I know how well you deal with these b*mb so… Sleep sight"
7911,Damon," Oh and when you do tell Elena and she needs a friend to talk to about anything, I'm here for her"
7912,John, Allo?
7913,Isobel, On your doorstep you'll find what you're looking for
7914,John, And my ring?
7915,Isobel," Don't screw this up. You know what you have to do, John"
7916,John, I got it. I won't fail
7917,Isobel," You better not. Katherine wants all of those tomb vampires dead, and I want to add two more to that list"
7918,John, Let me guess
7919,Isobel, Stefan and Damon. I don't want this life for her
7920,John, That was always part of the plan. Consider them gone
7921,Isobel," She's our daughter, John. We owe that to her"
7922,John, I know
7923,Caroline, So you're not going to tell me what happened?
7924,Bonnie," I did something bad, Caroline, and I lied about it"
7925,Caroline, To who?
7926,Bonnie, To Elena. I pretended to do something I didn't really do
7927,Caroline, What are you talking about?
7928,Bonnie," I couldn't do what she wanted me to do. It wasn't right. Grams would have never done it, so I couldn't either. But when Elena finds out, she's never gonna forgive me"
7929,Elena," Ouch, this dress hurts"
7930,Jenna, Suck it in baby
7931,Carol Lockwood," No, no, no, no, no! It's all wrong! The marching band should be in front at the historic society. Matt get up on the float. Boys, I asked you to put chairs on the founder's float"
7932,Damon," Look at you, all retro"
7933,Stefan, What are you doing here?
7934,Damon," Why wouldn't I be here? Bonnie deactivated the gilbert invention, Isobel is gone and it's founder's day! I'm here to pick candy and steal your girl"
7935,Stefan, Don't start with me Damon
7936,Damon," Oh, you started this Stefan with that whole ‘I'm insecure, leave Elena alone"" speech. I'm enjoying that"
7937,Stefan, As long as you heard it
7938,Damon, What? You've no sense of humor Stefan
7939,Stefan, Actually I've no sense of Damon humor
7940,Damon," Damon humor… Hey look, I get it, I get it. I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared, now that Katherine is out of the picture, that I'm turning all my attention to Elena. But don't worry, Elena is not Katherine"
7941,Stefan," You're right, she's not"
7942,Jeremy, Anna
7943,Anna, Look at you
7944,Jeremy, I know it's stupid uh? I'm part of the parade but how are you? I've been so worried and I feel awful
7945,Anna," Why? You didn't k*ll my mother, you uncle did"
7946,Jeremy, Are you sure it was him?
7947,Anna, Who else would have done it?
7948,John," He doesn't understand Anna, it's who he is. He hates all vampires. He's just doing what's he thinks is right"
7949,Anna, Are you defending him?
7950,Jeremy," No, no way. It's just… I do understand where he's coming from. He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just… trying to protect it"
7951,Anna, They do want revenge or at least they did but that's why we separated from them. My mom wasn't after revenge; she just wanted her life back. I have to get out of this town Jeremy
7952,Jeremy, You're leaving?
7953,Anna," I've been thinking, you can come with me, I could turn you. I mean, you said you wanted me to. There"
7954,Anna, It's my bl*od. If you die with it in your system you'll come back
7955,Jeremy, Anna…
7956,Anna," I know you, what it's like for you… being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand. But when you're a vampire you don't have to feel that way, you can shut it off. I can show you how"
7957,Jeremy," I wanted to, I did."
7958,Jeremy, But I don't think I can. Sorry
7959,Elena, John?! Is that even possible?
7960,Stefan, There is no proof but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager and he was the one who brought her to your dad's office for the delivery
7961,Elena, My whole life I've never like this man. I…
7962,Stefan," Sorry, I'm sorry. I just… I wanted to tell you before Damon drop it on you on some typically inappropriate way"
7963,Elena," No, I'm happy that you told me I just… I really hope that it's not true. What I am supposed to do? Do I just… confront him and say ""are you my biological father?"""
7964,Stefan, Yes when you're ready
7965,Elena," I'm never gonna be ready. Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about. Jeremy hates me and why wouldn't he? My journal gave him every single reason to"
7966,Stefan," He's just hurt, he's confused"
7967,Elena," He's never going to forgive me for Vicky, for taking away his memory, for lying to him."
7968,Stefan," He's your brother, he'll forgive you. Just give him some time"
7969,Bonnie, Say cheese!
7970,Caroline (to Matt)," Oh wait! Hide your cast, it's not era appropriate"
7971,Matt, Seriously?
7972,Caroline, Yes
7973,Matt," Okay, fine"
7974,Caroline, I want one with Bonnie now
7975,Tyler," Here, I can take it"
7976,Matt, I'll be on the float
7977,Tyler, I said I was sorry
7978,Caroline, You made out with his mother and then you b*at him to a plop. You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry
7979,Elena, Jeremy! I was wondering where you were. You look great and you did a really great job on the float
7980,Jeremy, Go away Elena
7981,Elena, Jeremy come on please! I don't want it to be like this between us
7982,Jeremy, Why don't you have Damon raise my memory again? Then I could go back to be your inner dark little brother
7983,Elena," Jer, please"
7984,Jeremy, Just don't! You can't fix this that easily; something like this doesn't just get fixed
7985,Carol Lockwood, Let's get a big applause to the Mystic Fall's high school Marching Band!
7986,Carol Lockwood," And for a little local history, Mr. Saltzman students have recreated Virginia's battle of Little Creek"
7987,Carol Lockwood, Ladies and gentlemen please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court and their handsome escort
7988,Carol Lockwood," This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls. Aren't they beautiful?"
7989,Bonnie, What do you want?
7990,Damon, Just watching the parade
7991,Damon, Where are you going?
7992,Bonnie, Away from you
7993,Damon, I wanted to say something to you
7994,Bonnie, Just leave me alone
7995,Damon, Thank you. The device that Emily spelled could have k*ll me. I don't take what you did lightly so… thank you
7996,Bonnie, I did it for Elena
7997,Damon, I know that but I'm still very grateful and… I owe you
7998,Damon, Enjoy the parade
7999,Carol Lockwood, Let's cheer for the Mystic Fall's high school football team. Alright! Let's show them our support everybody!
8000,John," This is the key. Once inserted, the device will be activated. It will work only once for an estimated time of 5 minutes"
8001,Mayor Lockwood," Yes, how does it work?"
8002,John," It's a high pitch frequency that humans can't hear. Any vampires in a five block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them. At that time the sheriff V5 DPTS will inject them with vervain and bring them here, when we will finish them all"
8003,Mayor Lockwood, And you're certain they're attacking tonight?
8004,John, I had a source. One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack
8005,The chief," Everybody listen up! Plan stays the same. We wait until the firework start, until then we blend in. Stay apart of the celebration; they'll never see us coming"
8006,John, They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864. It makes us their target
8007,The chief, This area here is the stage. This were the founding families are gonna be. Any questions?
8008,Mayor Lockwood, We're taking an enormous risk. We're talking about our families John!
8009,The chief, Anna? What are you doing here?
8010,John, This is the only way to drew all them out and k*ll them… all of them
8011,Damon," I like you better like this. Period look, it… didn't suit you"
8012,Elena, Is that an insult?
8013,Damon," Actually Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order"
8014,Elena," Look, o know Stefan is worried about our… friendship"
8015,Damon, Did he mention that to you too?
8016,Elena," No, did he mention something to you?"
8017,Damon," No, nothing worth repeating"
8018,Elena," So, I think you should stop with the flirty little comments and that eye thing that you do"
8019,Damon (smiling), What eye thing?
8020,Elena, Don't make me regret being your friend okay?
8021,Elena," I don't believe that we can't fix this. I lied, I was wrong but you're my brother Jer and I love you and I have to fix it. So just tell me, what can I do?"
8022,Jeremy, You can to hell Elena
8023,Damon (mocking at Jeremy)," ""I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them. Being a teenager is so hard!"""
8024,Jeremy, You dick!
8025,Damon, You do not talk to me like that! I'm not your sister. And for now on (He catches his arm) don't talk to your sister that way
8026,Jeremy," So, you're going to k*ll me just ‘cause I hurt Elena's feelings?"
8027,Damon, Got her some snack
8028,Jeremy, She raised my memory
8029,Damon," No, I did! She was protecting you"
8030,Jeremy, It wasn't her call to make
8031,Jeremy, let go of me before I call a scene
8032,Damon, You'll be unconscious before you even got a word out
8033,Stefan, Let him go
8034,Stefan, Are you alright?
8035,Jeremy, Yeah
8036,Stefan (looking at Damon)," What my brother is trying to say is don't blame Elena for this. Damon turned Vicky, I k*ll her. She was a threat to you and she was a threat to your sister. I'm sorry that it happened, I wish that it hadn't"
8037,Jeremy, She won't have me forget
8038,Damon," Good cab, bad cab, I like it"
8039,Stefan, What are you doing?
8040,Damon, He's been a punk
8041,Stefan, Elena's relationship with her brother is not even your business. Stay out of it!
8042,Damon," Oh, there's only one ""too good here"" role available. My bad I'm sorry"
8043,Stefan, Get over yourself. We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons
8044,Damon," You see, there you go with that jealousy act again. What are the right reasons Stefan? In light me please!"
8045,Stefan," Well, see Damon, it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing for nothing in return and I know that it is an entirely foreign concept to you. I completely understand that you wouldn't get it"
8046,Sheriff Forbes," You want to use our town as bait? It's too dangerous, too insane"
8047,Mayor Lockwood," You've got over the plans with you DPDS, they're all on board"
8048,Sheriff Forbes, You've gone behind me?
8049,Mayor Lockwood, Yeah because we know this is exactly how you'd react
8050,Sheriff Forbes, Our children are here
8051,John," Liz, we need to do this. We have no choice; this is the reason for the secret council. Our founding fathers created the secret council for just this purpose"
8052,Sheriff Forbes," I'm the Sheriff, it's my call and I say no"
8053,John," Richard, let me speak to the Sheriff alone"
8054,Sheriff Forbes," John, you're not thinking clearly, I'm not gonna change my mind about this"
8055,Damon, You're still around?
8056,Anna, There's something you need to know. The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight
8057,Damon, How do you know this?
8058,Anna, I went to them. They think I'm with them but I'm not. They want the founding families dead
8059,Damon, When is it supposed to happen?
8060,Anna, When the firework start
8061,Damon, John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them
8062,Anna, Then we can't be here
8063,Damon," It doesn't work, it's deactivated"
8064,Anna," Well, then a lot of people are gonna die "
8065,Damon, Where are they right now?
8066,Anna, They're already here Damon
8067,The chief," Remember, we don't know which of them injects vervain. It's not about the feed, it's about the k*ll. You know what to do"
8068,Damon, Rick!
8069,Alaric, Yeah?
8070,Damon, You keep those naughty little vampires darts in the car?
8071,Alaric," Yeah, why do you ask?"
8072,Damon, Because this square is crawling with tomb vampires. I think we might need a stake or two
8073,Alaric," Yeah, got it"
8074,Elena, What are you doing?
8075,Damon," Saving your life. Fifteen words or less… Tomb vamps are here, founding families are their target. (To Stefan) Get her out of here, now!"
8076,Stefan," Wait, where are you going?"
8077,Damon, It's more than fifteen words Stefan
8078,Elena," Wait, Jeremy is out here somewhere"
8079,Stefan," Let's go find him, come on!"
8080,Caroline," There this time, freshman year, when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that you would never talk again"
8081,Matt," Caroline, give it a rest"
8082,Mayor Lockwood, What are you doing here? I told you to go home
8083,Tyler, I decided not to
8084,Mayor Lockwood, If I tell you to do something you do it!
8085,Tyler, Let go of me!
8086,Caroline," Mayor, is everything okay?"
8087,Mayor Lockwood," Please Tyler; I need you to go home, now. Take your friends with you"
8088,Matt, why? What's going on?
8089,Mayor Lockwood," I can't explain. All of you need to get home, now. Please"
8090,Tyler," Yeah, okay"
8091,Mayor Lockwood," Here, take my car, it's on back. Caroline, Matt go with him"
8092,Jeremy, Anna what are you doing here? My uncle could see you
8093,Anna, I don't care about that. I needed to find you. Come here
8094,Mayor Lockwood," For one hundred and fifty years, Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody want to call home, safe, prospers, welcoming. And we have the founders to thank for that. That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's firework display to their legacy"
8095,John, Get position
8096,Mayor Lockwood, Enjoy the show!
8097,The chief," Excuse me, I'm sorry"
8098,Bonnie, I'm sorry
8099,Damon, Do you have any idea of what you've done?
8100,John," Yeah, as a matter of fact I do"
8101,Elena," Stefan, what's going on? What's happening?"
8102,Stefan, My head
8103,Elena, What?
8104,Stefan, My head
8105,Jeremy, Anna what's wrong?
8106,Anna, Please make it stop!
8107,(We see a succession of images," Stefan is holding his head, Damon is holding his head. Anna is in Jeremy's arms screaming. The tomb vampires' chief falls, one of the DPDS injects him vervain. John injects vervain to Damon) "
8108,Tyler, What the hell is that?
8109,Caroline, What's the matter?
8110,Tyler, That noise
8111,Matt," Wait, what noise?"
8112,Caroline, Tyler! Tyler!
8113,Matt," Caroline, the wheel!"
8114,Alaric," Hey, I got this one. There's one over there. Take this, go!"
8115,Elena," I don't know what happened, he just dropped"
8116,Alaric," Yeah, he's not the only one. The cabs have gotten everyone who's gone down, they injected them vervain"
8117,Elena, What?
8118,Elena, They're running up the vampires
8119,Carol Lockwood," Please help him, he just went down"
8120,Anna, ahhhhhhhh my head!
8121,DPD (to the radio), I got one
8122,Jeremy," Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, leave her alone!"
8123,Jeremy, Leave her alone! Anna!
8124,John," The device is done; the only thing that keeps them down is vervain. We don't have much time, let's finish this."
8125,John, Anna
8126,John (to the DPD), You can head up; I'll take it from here
8127,Anna, Please…no!
8128,Elena, Are you okay?
8129,Stefan, It's like needles were piercing my skull and it just stopped
8130,Alaric, I saw at least 5 vampires go down. They're taking them to your old family's building
8131,Stefan, It's the Gilbert's device. It has to be
8132,Elena, But how did he get it to work? Bonnie in spelled it
8133,Alaric, Maybe she didn't
8134,Elena," She did, we saw her do it"
8135,Stefan," No, no, no he's right. Think about it. We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires"
8136,Elena, So we could protect you
8137,Stefan, And Damon. Vampires. Where is Damon?
8138,Alaric, I don't know. I haven't seen him since this started
8139,Elena," Can you get my brother, take him home?"
8140,Alaric, Of course
8141,Elena, Let's go
8142,Carol Lockwood," Liz, are you okay?"
8143,Sheriff Forbes, There's a key on my…
8144,Carol Lockwood, What's going on?!
8145,Sheriff Forbes," There's a key in my belt, I need you to take it"
8146,Carol Lockwood," I've been looking everywhere for you, something happened to Richard. They took him"
8147,Sheriff Forbes, who took him?
8148,Carol Lockwood," Your DPDS. I don't understand, he's not a vampire"
8149,Sheriff Forbes, Let's go
8150,Damon, Mayor. Is that you?
8151,Mayor Lockwood, What are you doing here?
8152,Damon," I'm a vampire. What's your excuse? No, really. The vervain doesn't affect you, you're not a vampire, what the hell are you?"
8153,The chief, Mayor Lockwood!
8154,Matt," Hey, are you okay?"
8155,Caroline," I'm fine, I'm fine"
8156,Matt," No, they need to check you out"
8157,Caroline," No, I'm fine I'm fine. They're helping Tyler"
8158,Doctor 1, What the hell?!
8159,Matt, What's wrong?
8160,Doctor 1, His eyes
8161,Tyler, What happened?
8162,Matt," Dude, don't scare me like that"
8163,Matt, Caroline! Guys over here! Caroline wake up!
8164,Stefan," Wait, wait, wait, I can hear them. The building is on fire"
8165,Elena, What?
8166,Elena, Where is Damon?
8167,John, With the rest of them where he should be. It's over for Damon
8168,Elena, You're crazy
8169,John, Why? Because I'm doing what should have been done a hundred and fifty five years ago? This is the right thing Elena
8170,John," Go ahead, you won't make it out. It'll save me the trouble of k*ll you myself"
8171,Stefan," You now the building well, is there another entrance in?"
8172,Elena," The emergency door, she's on the side"
8173,John, You take one more step and I tell those DPDS that they missed a vampire
8174,Elena, I'm asking you not to
8175,John, That doesn't mean anything to me
8176,Elena, As my father it should
8177,John, You know
8178,Elena, I wasn't sure but now I am
8179,Bonnie," Hey, you can't go in there!"
8180,Bonnie, Fire will take you out
8181,Stefan, He's my brother Bonnie
8182,Elena, Stefan!
8183,Bonnie," Elena, you can't go in there!"
8184,Elena," Bonnie, what are you doing?"
8185,Bonnie, I'm sorry I lied to you
8186,Elena, Bonnie I've got to get in there!
8187,Stefan," Damon! Come on, hurry"
8188,Elena, Bonnie… Bonnie what is it? Are they gonna be okay?
8189,Elena, Oh my god!
8190,Elena, The fire is out. Story is that building's old wirings caused it
8191,Stefan, Did you see where Damon went?
8192,Elena," No, he just kind of disappeared"
8193,Elena, I'm so glad you're okay
8194,Stefan, I try so hard… to hate him. Now I guess it's just pointless
8195,Elena," You care about him, so do I but I love you Stefan and I know that you are worried about that"
8196,Stefan," I just… you know, I know my brother"
8197,Elena, But I love you Stefan
8198,Stefan, I know the trouble he can cause
8199,Elena," I love you Stefan, you!"
8200,Elena, You have nothing to worry about okay?
8201,Elena," Jenna called, Jeremy's home, I'm just gonna run over the school to pick up my dress, my clothe and the rest of my stuff and then I'll check on him"
8202,"(Jeremy is on his bed; he looks at the flask, gets up and puts it in his drawer. He turns his head", Damon is here)
8203,Jeremy, What are you doing here?
8204,Damon, Anna's dead
8205,Jeremy, I figured that once they took her away
8206,Damon, I know you cared about her
8207,Jeremy, Yeah I did
8208,Damon, I saw her k*ll. I was watching and all I could think about was… I wanted to help her but I couldn't
8209,Jeremy, Why are you telling me all this?
8210,Damon," I took away your suffering once before, I can do it again but it's your choice"
8211,Jeremy," Look, I know you think you took it away but it's still there. Even if I can't remember why I still feel empty, alone and making me forget won't fix it. It won't fix what's really wrong"
8212,Damon, What I did to Vicky was wrong. Sorry for my part
8213,Jeremy, Anna said that don't have to feel pain; that they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity
8214,Damon, It's very true.
8215,Jeremy, Is it easier that way?
8216,Damon, Is what easier?
8217,Jeremy, Life
8218,Damon, Life sucks either way Jeremy but at least if you're a vampire you don't have to feel bad about it if you don't want to
8219,Jeremy, Is that what you did?
8220,Damon, I did it for a… I did it for a very long time and life was a lot easier
8221,Tyler," Hey man. I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know what happened"
8222,Matt, It's okay man
8223,Matt," What's happening, is she alright?"
8224,Sheriff Forbes, There was some internal bleeding; they're taking her to surgery
8225,Matt, What else did they say? Is she gonna be okay?
8226,Sheriff Forbes, They're gonna do everything they can
8227,Sheriff Forbes," Tyler, have you talk to your mom?"
8228,Tyler, I left a message telling I was here
8229,Sheriff Forbes, You need to call her
8230,Tyler, What is it?
8231,Sheriff Forbes, it's your dad
8232,Stefan, oh hey
8233,Bonnie, Hey
8234,Stefan, You… you just missed Elena
8235,Bonnie, I was looking for you actually
8236,Stefan, Oh
8237,Bonnie, Elena is my best friend and because she loves you I couldn't let you and Damon die in that fire
8238,Stefan," I'm very grateful Bonnie, I hope you know that"
8239,Bonnie, I do but I hope you know that things have to change. Damon has to change
8240,Stefan, We both want the same thing
8241,Bonnie," We both want to protect the people we care about. The difference is, for you Damon is one of them. You saw what I was able to do tonight, I know who I am now and if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent bl*od, I'll take him down even if I have to take you with him"
8242,Stefan, Let's hope it doesn't come to that
8243,Bonnie, Let's hope it doesn't
8244,Elena, What are you doing here?
8245,Damon, Failed and feeble attempt of doing the right thing
8246,Elena, which was…?
8247,Damon, It's not important. Let me take this for you
8248,Elena, Thank you
8249,Damon," You know, I came in this town wanting to destroy it. Tonight I found myself wanting to protect it. How does that happen? I'm not a hero, Elena. I don't do good. It's not in me"
8250,Elena, Maybe it is
8251,Damon," No. Nah, it's reserved for my brother, and you…and Bonnie... Even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me"
8252,Elena, Why do you sound so surprised?
8253,Damon, Because she did it for you. Which means that somewhere along the way you decided that I was worth saving. And I wanted to thank you for that
8254,Elena, You're welcome
8255,Elena, Hi
8256,Jenna," It's late, you should probably come inside"
8257,Jenna, What are you doing?
8258,Elena, I don't want to talk about it
8259,John, You scared me
8260,Elena, Sorry
8261,John," You know, I first met Isobel when I was a teenager. I fall in love with her instantly although I'm pretty sure she never loved me. She was special. A part why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became, how it ruined her and I never would have sent her to Damon if I had known she wanted to turn."
8262,John, It's my fault. I'm telling you this because I hoped maybe you'd understand
8263,Elena, Thank you
8264,John, Can I help?
8265,Elena, Sure
8266,John, Katherine?!
8267,Katherine," Hello, John. Goodbye, John"
8268,Elena," I looked everywhere. Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff. I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I'll go to the hospital. Can you meet me there? Okay, I love you Stefan"
8269,Elena, Jeremy?! Are you up?
8270,John, You scared me
8271,Katherine, Sorry
8272,John, Is Jenna home?
8273,Katherine," She had to meet the fire chief about the building. She doesn't know the truth, they had covered that up"
8274,John," Yeah I know, how's Jeremy?"
8275,Katherine, Hold up in his room
8276,Elena, I looked everywhere
8277,Stefan," What do you think, someone stole it?"
8278,Elena," Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff"
8279,John, Can I help?
8280,Katherine, Sure
8281,Stefan, You want me to pick you out?
8282,Elena," I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital, can you meet me there?"
8283,Stefan, You bet
8284,Elena," Ok, I love you Stefan"
8285,Stefan, I love you too
8286,John, Katherine?
8287,Katherine," Hello John, Goodbye John"
8288,Elena, Jeremy? Are you up?
8289,Elena, Hi I need an ambulance to 2104 Maple Street
8290,John, Behind you
8291,Elena, What?
8292,John, Behind you
8293,Elena, Jeremy
8294,Elena, Jeremy! Jeremy!
8295,Elena, Jeremy please wake up
8296,Stefan, What happened?
8297,Elena, He said that Anna gave him her bl*od and then he took this pills and now… I mean he looks fine but so do you. I just… I don't know
8298,Stefan, Look at me
8299,Jeremy, I'm fine okay? I feel exactly the same
8300,Elena, Should I call a paramedic? What should I do?
8301,Stefan," No, he's fine"
8302,Jeremy, You mean I'm not a vampire? Damn it!
8303,Elena," Don't say that Jeremy! Jer, what do you want that?"
8304,Jeremy," Did you hear about Anna, what happened to her tonight? She's dead"
8305,Stefan," Jeremy, Jeremy. Come here, sit down"
8306,Stefan," I'm sorry about Anne but it's very important that you listen to me right now. Every passing moment Anna's bl*od is leaving your system. If you try to k*ll yourself right now, you could really die"
8307,Stefan, Hey! Do you understand me?
8308,Elena, Stefan…
8309,Jeremy," Yeah, I understand"
8310,Stefan, Good
8311,Elena, What about the pills that he took?
8312,Stefan, He didn't take enough to die so Anna's bl*od actually hilled him about
8313,Policemen, Miss Gilbert?
8314,Elena, I'll be right there
8315,Stefan, You need to be at the hospital
8316,Elena, But…
8317,Stefan," No, no, no, I'll stay here with Jeremy"
8318,Jeremy," No, I don't need a babysitter"
8319,Elena," Yes, you do"
8320,Bonnie, How is Caroline?
8321,Matt, She's not good Bon
8322,Bonnie, What happened?
8323,Matt, We were driving and Tyler heard this noise and he got…
8324,Bonnie, A noise?
8325,Matt, He got this migraine or something and he lost control of the car and… I thought Caroline was fine and then… and then she wasn't so…
8326,Damon," Liz, I came as soon as I get the message. Is she okay?"
8327,Sheriff Forbes," She's in surgery, it's … they're doing everything they can. I need your help Damon"
8328,Damon," Sure, anything Liz"
8329,Sheriff Forbes, Mayor Lockwood is dead. They thought he was a vampire. They put him in the basement
8330,Damon, Mayor Lockwood is a vampire?
8331,Sheriff Forbes," No, no. A mistake was made, they said he drops like the others when John's device when off but he… he couldn't have been a vampire, I've known him my whole life and know Carol Lockwood is gonna want answers and all I can think of right now is Caroline and…"
8332,Damon, It's okay
8333,Elena, How's Caroline?
8334,Bonnie, She's weak. They don't know if she's going to make it
8335,Elena, What?
8336,Elena, Is there something that we can do? Like a spell or something?
8337,Damon," She doesn't know how, do you?"
8338,Bonnie," No, I don't"
8339,Damon," No, you don't because it took Emily years to learn a spell like that"
8340,Bonnie," Now I can take down a vampire, this spell was easy to learn"
8341,Damon, I can give Caroline some bl*od
8342,Elena," No, no way"
8343,Damon," No, just enough to heal her, she will be safe in the hospital and it will be out of her system in a day, she will be better Elena"
8344,Elena," It's too risky, I can't agree to that"
8345,Bonnie, Do it. This is Caroline. We can't let her die. Do it
8346,Damon," If I do this, you and me, call truce?"
8347,Bonnie," No but you'll do it anyway, for Elena"
8348,Damon, I know this is probably the last thing you want to do right now but we should talk about what happened tonight
8349,Elena," Yeah, one of the tomb vampires has got into to house and almost k*ll John"
8350,Damon, What? When? What are you talking about? After I left?
8351,Elena, You were there?
8352,Damon, Come on Elena you know I was
8353,Elena, When were you at the house?
8354,Damon," Really? Earlier, on the porch, we were talking, exposed our feelings, come on, we kissed Elena!"
8355,Elena," Okay, I don't have time for this Damon"
8356,Damon, If you want to forget what happened fine but I can't
8357,Jenna," Elena, I came as soon as I get you message. How is John?"
8358,Elena, Where have you been?
8359,Jenna," At the fire department, I deferred a report. I told you earlier"
8360,Elena," No, you didn't"
8361,Jenna, Yes I did
8362,Elena," No, Jenna, you didn't"
8363,Jenna, Yes I did
8364,Damon," Oh, you got to be kidding me"
8365,Stefan, Hey! How was Caroline?
8366,Katherine, Not good
8367,Katherine, Just what I needed
8368,Stefan, Katherine
8369,Katherine, I least I fooled one of you
8370,Katherine, Feeling better?
8371,Elena, Stefan?
8372,Stefan, What happened?
8373,Damon, Katherine happened
8374,Damon, Did she say what she wanted?
8375,Stefan, No
8376,Damon, This women certainly knows how to make an entrance
8377,Stefan, She said she fooled one of us at least. What is that mean?
8378,Damon, She pretended to be Elena too when I showed up earlier tonight
8379,Elena," I told Jeremy, I can't lie to him anymore"
8380,Stefan, Are you alright?
8381,Elena," No, I'm not alright. I thought that with all the tomb vampires gone things were getting better"
8382,Stefan," I know, we all did"
8383,Elena," Katherine was in this house, that means she's been invited in, what are we gonna do?"
8384,Damon, Move
8385,Elena," Very helpful, thank you"
8386,Damon," Katherine wants you dead, there's zero you can do about it, you will be dead but you're not. So clearly she has other plans"
8387,Stefan, Right and we need to find out what those other plans are and not provoke her in the process. What happened tonight when you thought she was Elena?
8388,Damon, To risk another front line encroaching on your very crowded forehead … We… kissed
8389,Elena, And you thought it was me?
8390,Stefan, What do you mean you kissed?
8391,Damon," You know, when two lips pucker and then"
8392,Damon, Don't be obvious Stefan
8393,Elena," Stefan wait, he kissed Katherine, not me"
8394,Elena, I wouldn't do that. We don't have time for this guys
8395,Stefan, Later
8396,Elena, John must know something. It has to be a reason why Katherine tried to k*ll him
8397,Damon," She's Katherine, she loves to play games and you're fooling yourself if you think you're going to find out what she's been up to before she wants you to know"
8398,Stefan," No, actually Elena's right, John could know something threw Isobel. You mother, she was in touch with Katherine so maybe we can go to the hospital and talk"
8399,Damon, I've got a better idea
8400,Elena, What's that?
8401,Damon, I'm just gonna ignore the bitch. See you
8402,Elena, Is that smart?
8403,Damon," If Katherine thinks she's been ignored it will low her out, she'll make a move"
8404,Stefan, Yeah? And then what?
8405,Damon," Stake her; rip her head off, something poetic. We'll see"
8406,Bonnie, You've been here all night?
8407,Matt," Yeah, with the sheriff"
8408,Bonnie, No one else?
8409,Matt, Stefan's brother Damon stopped by late last night
8410,Bonnie, How is Caroline today?
8411,Matt, See for yourself
8412,Caroline, Jersey Shore's on
8413,Caroline," Careful, still a little sore"
8414,Bonnie, Sorry
8415,Caroline, its okay but they say I'm healing very quick
8416,Matt, My turn
8417,Caroline, Why are you crying?
8418,Bonnie, I'm just happy you're okay
8419,Caroline, I love you guys
8420,Bonnie, We love you
8421,Carol Lockwood, I want to know exactly who's responsible for k*ll my husband
8422,Sheriff Forbes, I'm looking into it but you have to be straight. Is there any reason Richard was affected by the vampire device?
8423,Carol Lockwood, Are you implying that he was one of them?
8424,Damon," No, no one's implying that"
8425,Carol Lockwood," Your deputies screwed up, plain and simple which makes you responsible"
8426,Damon, Carol…
8427,Sheriff Forbes, Your husband is the one who helped John Gilbert execute his idiot plan in the first place 
8428,Damon, Liz…
8429,Carol Lockwood, Someone got my husband k*ll
8430,Damon," We're all in edge here, you've suffer a great loss, the whole town has. We have to stick together okay? Trust each other, we're gonna get through this"
8431,Tyler, So the black sheep returns
8432,Mason, Tyler?
8433,Tyler, Yeah
8434,Mason, What happened to you? In my mind you were twelve years old
8435,Tyler," Then that's two years older than the last time you saw me, Uncle Mason"
8436,Mason, Good to see you again
8437,Tyler, It's good to see you too. Come on inside
8438,Stefan, Ready for this?
8439,Elena, John?
8440,Elena," I'm Elena, I'm not Katherine"
8441,Stefan, We know she did this to you
8442,Elena, We need to know why
8443,John, Where is she?
8444,Stefan, You tell us
8445,John, I don't know
8446,Stefan," You're a little too weak to play tough guy, I want you to sit back and answer a few questions"
8447,Elena," Please, tell us why she's here. What does she want?"
8448,Stefan, She'll try again; we can't help you if you don't confide in us
8449,John, In you?
8450,Stefan, In your daughter then
8451,John, My daughter should have put you a stake to your heart by now
8452,John," I never spoke to her directly, she never trusted me"
8453,John, So either k*ll me or get out because I can't stand the sight of you with my daughter
8454,Elena, You see the problem with such hatred? It's gonna get you k*ll
8455,Stefan, You may be okay with dying but I have a better plan for you
8456,Stefan," You know, with my bl*od in your system all I have to do is k*ll you. Now take my advice… Leave town, Elena doesn't want you here. You've got about 24 hours before the bl*od leaves your system, that's enough time to disappear or I swear to god I will turn you into a vampire and I will watch you hate yourself more than you already do"
8457,Stefan, The clock starts now
8458,Damon, Who's the guy with Carol?
8459,Sheriff Forbes," It's the mayor's younger brother, Mason Lockwood"
8460,Damon, Is he in the council? Like John Gilbert when he rolled in?
8461,Sheriff Forbes," He's nothing like John. For one, he's not an ass. He's not a believer either. He wants nothing to do with the council. He's too preoccupied finding the perfect wave"
8462,Damon, Thanks see you
8463,Tyler," Hey Elena, thanks for coming, come on in"
8464,Elena," Hey, I just have to swim by home to pick up Jenna and Jeremy so we can go to the Lockwood's. How did you leave him there, John?"
8465,Stefan, I… I asked him to leave town
8466,Elena, Asked? You threatened him
8467,Stefan, Yeah I threatened him
8468,Elena," Good. I want him gone, Stefan. I know that I shouldn't feel that way but I don't want someone like that in my life or Jeremy's life"
8469,Stefan, I know
8470,Elena, So what now?
8471,Stefan, Now… I need to go find Damon
8472,Elena," Please Stefan, don't fight with him"
8473,Stefan," No Elena, he tried to kiss you I'm not okay with that"
8474,Elena," That's not the problem, Katherine is. She's already messing with both of your heads and Damon is not stable when it comes to her. The last thing we need is to make things worse"
8475,Bonnie, Did you know the Gilbert device affected Tyler Lockwood?
8476,Damon," Well, I know mayor in"
8477,Bonnie, Don't you want to know why?
8478,Damon," Yes Bonnie, I would love to know why. A non-vampire was tortured by the vampire torture device that you let John Gilbert use against us. Speaking of your guilt how is Caroline?"
8479,Bonnie, Much better
8480,Damon, You're welcome
8481,Bonnie," No, you're welcome"
8482,Damon, Why am I welcome?
8483,Bonnie, You live to see another day
8484,Damon," No good deal goes unpunished with you, doesn't?"
8485,Bonnie," Doesn't undue the bad. I know what you are Damon, you might have Elena and the sheriff and everybody else fooled but not me. One wrong move and I'm gonna take you out"
8486,Damon, Now you need to stop with the witches' brood. You're starting to believe your own press 
8487,Bonnie," I'm sorry, you were saying?"
8488,Bonnie, Oh my god! Damon drives me crazy. He's walking around like he's some kind of hero for healing Caroline when it's his fault all of this happened in the first place 
8489,Katherine, I'm sorry Bonnie. What Damon's done is just awful
8490,Bonnie," Okay, better. Hateful Damon moment over"
8491,Bonnie, I've got to find Tyler and Give my respects. I'll be back
8492,Elena, Allo?
8493,Bonnie, Elena? Where are you?
8494,Elena," Bonnie, I know I'm late. I'm getting in the car now. I'll be here in 5"
8495,Katherine," We haven't officially met, I'm Katherine"
8496,Bonnie, I know who you are
8497,Katherine," Of course you do. You're the best friend right? I've been putting all the pieces of Elena's life together. Isobel told me it was a bit of a puzzle. I do know who Jenna and Jeremy are and I met that delicious ex-boyfriend Matt, he was sweet on Caroline, and then there's you, the vampire-hating Bennett witch. Did I do good?"
8498,Katherine, I've been around a long time Bonnie; you have to do better than that
8499,Katherine, Nice
8500,Stefan, Katherine
8501,Katherine, Stefan
8502,Stefan, Leave her alone
8503,Katherine, Okay
8504,Stefan, What are you doing here?
8505,Katherine," After the way you treated me last night, I thought that a public place would be less violent"
8506,Stefan, You're taking this a little far don't you think? Elena could walk in at any moment
8507,Katherine," But that's part of the fun Stefan. Damon's here, somewhere, I've been avoiding him"
8508,Matt, Hey guys
8509,Katherine," Hey Matt. I heard that Caroline is doing much better. Her recovery was practically miraculous, you must be so relieved"
8510,Matt, I am. Thanks Elena
8511,Katherine, Oh! His eyes are so blue!
8512,Stefan, You need to leave now
8513,Katherine, You're hurting my feelings Stefan. Damon was much happier to see me but he thought I was your girlfriend so…
8514,Stefan," Katherine, I'm not doing this with you"
8515,Katherine," Okay, how we don't have a couple's fight in front of all of your friends? Walk with me"
8516,Stefan, Just tell me what you're doing here
8517,Katherine, Maybe I missed you. Is that an acceptable reason?
8518,Stefan, What game are you playing?
8519,Katherine," Why, you want to play with me?"
8520,Stefan," I don't know, how can I play if I don't know the rules? "
8521,Katherine, No rules Stefan. Don't you remember? No rules
8522,Jenna, Looks like the whole town has turned out
8523,Elena, Yeah. Well he is… he was the mayor
8524,Jeremy, Why are they doing this for the funeral?
8525,Jenna, That's what people do. The Lockwood's were here for us when we went through this. It'll be quick; you drop off the food and pay respects and go
8526,Jeremy, In and out? It sounds like a plan
8527,Elena," You guys go ahead, I'll be right there okay?"
8528,Elena," Hey, how are you doing?"
8529,Damon," Great Elena. Walking on sunshine, thanks for asking"
8530,Elena, Damon
8531,Damon, Elena
8532,Elena," We should be able to talk about this. Damon, we're close enough now. I really want to know how you are doing"
8533,Damon, I kissed you; I thought you kissed me back… Doppelganger hijinks ensued… How do you think I'm doing?
8534,Elena, I think you're hurt
8535,Damon," No, I don't get hurt, Elena"
8536,Elena," No, you don't admit that you get hurt. You get angry and cover that up and then you do something stupid"
8537,Damon, You're scared. You think Katherine is gonna send me off the depend don't you? I don't need her for that.
8538,Damon, You know… why this is such a surprise that I would kiss you?
8539,Elena, That's not a surprise. I'm surprised that you thought I would kiss you back
8540,Damon, Now I'm hurt
8541,Bonnie, Elena!
8542,Elena," Bonnie, what happened ?"
8543,Jeremy," Sorry, I was just looking for the…"
8544,Tyler, Bathroom is down the hall
8545,Jeremy, Hey look… I'm sorry about your dad
8546,Tyler, Today has been a big day as sorry from people who don't really give a crap
8547,Jeremy," I remember when my dad died; I had a house full of strangers telling me how a great guy he was. Anyway, I know how hard all this is"
8548,Tyler, The difference is in your case it was true. My dad was a dick
8549,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah he was"
8550,Tyler, I found this on his desk
8551,Tyler," He won't mind, he's dead"
8552,Jeremy," Yeah, you know what, sure"
8553,Mason," Hey, what's going on here Tyler?"
8554,Tyler," Nothing, nothing"
8555,Mason, You don't have somewhere else to be?
8556,Katherine, The Lockwood's have a lot more land than they used to. These actions from the tomb vampires built them quite a fortune
8557,Stefan," Yeah, why did you want them dead? You're the one who turned most of them"
8558,Katherine, There's nothing more annoying than revengeful vampire Stefan. Just ask John Gilbert
8559,Stefan, You haven't changed at all don't you?
8560,Katherine," But you have. You're stronger, meaner, sexy"
8561,Stefan, Don't flirt with me Katherine. I'm not Damon; I haven't spent one hundred and forty five years obsessed with you
8562,Katherine," Yeah, based on your choice of woman I'd say otherwise. Although I admit it does bother me that you're falling in love with someone else"
8563,Stefan," I was never in love with you, Katherine. You compelled me so none of my feelings were real"
8564,Katherine, Believe what you want Stefan but I know the truth and deep down so do you
8565,Stefan," The truth? Well the truth is, you're the same lying, selfish, manipulative bitch that you've always been. So, whatever it is that brought you here, why don't you just get down with it and leave town? Because if you don't, I will hunt you down and I will rip your heart out"
8566,Katherine, You want to know why I'm here Stefan? I came back for you 
8567,Stefan, Well the problem Katherine is that I hate you
8568,Katherine," You hate me uh? That sound like the beginning of a love story Stefan, not the end of one"
8569,Elena, You're gonna be okay?
8570,Stefan," Yeah, it will heal"
8571,Elena, It's not what I meant
8572,Stefan, I was trying to figure her out. I was playing along and let her get to me
8573,Damon," I tried to track her but she's gone. Ouch, cover up Fabio. You have a crazy ex on the loess"
8574,Damon," You better watch out, looks like Katherine is trying to steal your guy"
8575,Stefan, it's not what's happening
8576,Damon, Isn't it? I mean it's only fair since I went after your girl
8577,Elena, I'm gonna go check on Jenna and Jeremy. Let me know when you guys are done
8578,Damon," So what's gonna be uh? Fight to the death? Go ahead, make your threat, stake your claim"
8579,Stefan, I'm not gonna fight you
8580,Damon, Why? I'd fight me
8581,Stefan," Katherine is gonna try to play us against each other, you do know that right?"
8582,Damon," Brother, don't you worry, our bound is unbreakable"
8583,Stefan," We need to stay united against her. So yes, as much as I would like to k*ll you, I'm not gonna fight you "
8584,Damon, I kissed Elena 
8585,Stefan," Because you feel something for her, because you actually care and I'm not gonna let Katherine coming here and destroy that part of you that is finally, after all of this time, willing to feel something. She will try to"
8586,John, Jeremy
8587,Jeremy, What are you doing here?
8588,John," I'm packing, leaving"
8589,Jeremy, So you figured you k*ll all you evil vampires and then you leave town?
8590,John, Not all but enough. For now. Can you tell Elena I say goodbye?
8591,Jeremy, Why don't you tell her yourself?
8592,John," You know Jeremy, I was taught to hate them, the vampires. That's what I know; that's what you father knew"
8593,Jeremy, My father would have seen things differently
8594,John," No, he may have done things differently but there's no other way to see it"
8595,Jeremy," That ring on your finger, the one's that supposed to protect you, that was my father's right?"
8596,John, Yeah
8597,Jeremy," Then why didn't it protect him, why is he still dead?"
8598,John," What happened to your parents wasn't supernatural, it was an accident. There's nothing that can save us from that"
8599,Jeremy," I wonder what he'd think of all this, of me"
8600,John, He would think that you're just too young. You're still finding yourself but you are a Gilbert and you've been exposed to this town's darkest secrets and with that come responsibility
8601,Jeremy, I don't believe in that family legacy stuff
8602,John, Sooner or later you'll have to
8603,Carol Lockwood, Tyler! What are you doing?
8604,Tyler, I hate him
8605,Carol Lockwood," Oh, don't say that"
8606,Tyler, Let go of me!
8607,Tyler, Let go of me!
8608,Mason, Tyler! Hey!
8609,Tyler, I said let go of me!
8610,Mason," Tyler! Look at me, look at me. Calm down, settle down"
8611,Carol Lockwood, Oh god
8612,Damon, Very brave of you to come here
8613,Katherine, I wanted to say goodbye
8614,Damon, Leaving so soon?
8615,Katherine, I know when I'm not wanted
8616,Damon, Don't pout; it's not attractive about a woman of your age
8617,Katherine," Ouch. What, no goodbyes kiss?"
8618,Damon, What if I k*ll you instead? What are you doing here?
8619,Katherine," Nostalgia, curiosity etc."
8620,Damon, I like better the enigmatic Katherine. What are you up to?
8621,Katherine," Trust me Damon, when I'm up to something you'll know it. Come on, kiss me or k*ll me. Which will it be Damon? We both know that you're only capable of one"
8622,Katherine," My sweet, innocent Damon"
8623,Damon," Okay, brief pause. I have a question. Answer it and its back to fireworks and rockets wire glare. Answer it right and I'll forget the last one hundred and forty five years that I spent missing you. I'll forget how much I loved you, I'll forget everything and we could start over. This could be our defining moment ‘cause we have the time, it's the beauty of eternity"
8624,Damon," I just need the truth, just once"
8625,Katherine," Stop, I already know the question and its answer. The truth is… I've never loved you, it was always Stefan"
8626,Elena," Oh god, you scared me"
8627,Damon," I'm just doing my part, the neighborhood watch"
8628,Elena," Thanks for looking out for us, for me"
8629,Damon," That's me, the trusted bodyguard, calm in crisis"
8630,Elena," You've been drinking? And you're upset, that's not a good combination"
8631,Damon, No I'm not upset. Upset is an emotion specific to those who care
8632,Elena," Come on Damon. That's a lie, you care"
8633,Damon, You are surprise that I thought you would kiss me back? You can't imagine that I believe you would want to?
8634,Elena, Damon…
8635,Damon," No, all we've been doing here means something. You are the liar Elena. There is something going on between the two of us and you know it"
8636,Damon," And you're lying to me, you're lying to Stefan and most of all you're lying to yourself. I can prove it"
8637,Elena, No
8638,Elena, Damon don't! What's wrong with you?
8639,Damon, Am I lying about this?
8640,Elena," Stop, you're better than this, come on!"
8641,Damon, That's where you're wrong
8642,Elena," No, no Damon. I care about you. Listen to me, I care about you. I do but… I love Stefan, it's always gonna be Stefan"
8643,Jeremy," Elena, what's going on in here?"
8644,Elena," Nothing Jeremy, it's okay, just go back to bed"
8645,Damon, No it's not okay Elena
8646,Damon, He wants to be a vampire
8647,Elena, No Damon stop it!
8648,Damon," You want to turn off the pain? It's the easiest thing in the world. The part of you that cares just goes away, all you have to do is flip the switch and snatch!"
8649,Elena, No!
8650,Mason, Your mom's out. I think she propped a couple of pills
8651,Tyler, I didn't mean to freak her out. I don't know why I get like this
8652,Mason, It's the curse of being a Lockwood
8653,Tyler, Is this how you get the shill gene?
8654,Mason, I didn't. I've just learned how to manage it
8655,Tyler, I don't want to be like this anymore
8656,Mason, None of us do. That's why it's a curse Ty
8657,Stefan," He saw the ring that's why he did it, he knew"
8658,Elena, He didn't see the ring
8659,Stefan," It's Katherine. She got on his skin, she undead everything that was good about him"
8660,Elena," There's nothing good about him. Stefan, not anymore. He just decided what he wants. He just don't want to feel, he wants to be hated, it's just easier that way. He got his wish,"
8661,Elena, I hate him; Stefan
8662,Stefan, I know
8663,Elena," Stefan, is he okay?"
8664,Stefan, He's okay
8665,Jeremy," he k*ll me, Damon k*ll me"
8666,Elena, Oh god
8667,Caroline, Elena?
8668,Katherine, Hey Caroline
8669,Caroline, What are you doing here?
8670,Katherine, My name is Katherine. I was hoping you could get the Salvatore's brothers a message for me
8671,Caroline, What are you talking about? What message?
8672,Katherine, Game on
8673,Caroline, Excuse me? Where is everyone?
8674,Nurse, It's the middle of the night honey
8675,Caroline," It is? Oh, uh… have you seen my mom?"
8676,Nurse, She left after dinner with your boyfriend and then your friend Elena stepped by
8677,Caroline," She did? Yeah, she did but she said her name was Katherine. Can I just get something to eat?"
8678,Nurse, Breakfast comes around seven
8679,Caroline, But I'm hungry
8680,Nurse, You should go back to sleep
8681,Caroline, What is that smell?
8682,Nurse, Back to bed
8683,Nurse, What are you doing in here?
8684,Caroline, I don't know
8685,Nurse, You need to go back to bed
8686,Bonnie," Katherine looked just like you, it was freakish"
8687,Elena," She is my ancestor. Eh, I move the student booth into the cafeteria"
8688,Bonnie, Your vampire ancestor and she didn't just resemble you like a family member would. She was you
8689,Elena," I don't know, I can't explain it. It's creepy, that's all you got"
8690,Bonnie, How do you know she's not still out there pretending to be you?
8691,Elena, I don't but I could sit here and be tortured by the not-knowing or I could get these prices to the ring toss
8692,Bonnie, Have you talk to Damon since he k*ll Jeremy or tried to k*ll Jeremy?
8693,Elena," No Bonnie, I haven't and I won't and I don't want to talk about Damon or anything else that's vampire relating okay?"
8694,Elena," I'm human. I have to do human stuff. Otherwise, I'm going to go crazy"
8695,Bonnie," Okay, I'm sorry, let's focus. We have to make Caroline proud or she will k*ll us. I don't know how she does all of this"
8696,Elena," Well because she's not human, obviously"
8697,Bonnie, Obviously
8698,Stefan, It's the same as the bracelet Elena gave you
8699,Jeremy, It protects me from compulsion
8700,Stefan, Vervain is toxic to vampires
8701,Jeremy, Like poison?
8702,Stefan," Yeah, it's very poisonous. It keeps them out of your head"
8703,Jeremy, but why vervain?
8704,Stefan," don't know, certain natural herbs and roots and other elements are just harmful to vampires"
8705,Jeremy, Like a stake to the heart?
8706,Stefan, Right but it has to be wood
8707,Jeremy, You're pretty confident in yourself telling me all the different ways I could k*ll you
8708,Stefan," Jeremy, if I thought you wanted to k*ll me we will be having a much different conversation"
8709,Jeremy," Yeah, Damon is the one that deserves it"
8710,Stefan," I want you to forget about Damon, all right? He's hundred times stronger than you and right now he's not stable. You got to try to move forward"
8711,Jeremy, I was k*ll by a vampire and brought back by a magic ring. How do you move forward from that?
8712,Stefan," Right. Well, today we have a nice little distraction encouraged by the slave driver Elena"
8713,Stefan, Hello Elena
8714,Elena," Hey, do you…"
8715,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah, I set up the golden fish toss all through hundred golden fish. It's gonna be epic!"
8716,Stefan," He's gonna be alright, he's just been through a little bit of a whole deal"
8717,Elena, I was just hoping that this carnival would wild him back into the land of a high school teenager
8718,Stefan, That was what we were doing here?
8719,Elena," Yes, we all are. We're gonna be boring high school students who live in a world where the ""v"" word is not ordered"
8720,Stefan, Got it!
8721,Elena," Then later you're going to take me on the Ferris wheel, we're gonna ride the very top and then you're gonna kiss me and my heart will flatter like a normal high school girl. Do you see a redeem theme here?"
8722,Stefan," Yeah I know, I'm seeing it and I'm liking it but I have a quick question. Uh, what do we do about Damon?"
8723,Elena," Uh, no ""D"" word okay? That has been deleted from the list of topic that we can discuss"
8724,Stefan," Unfortunately Katherine showing up has been a little bit of an odd place, little off-kidder, kind of dangerous. Who knows what he's up to?"
8725,Carol, So I understand John Gilbert has left town. Have they found the vampire that attacked him?
8726,Damon," Well, the sheriff has asked me to take the lead on that and I promess to you I will get to the bottom of it"
8727,Carol," Which brings me to my next subject. With Richard gone, I'll be acting as interim mayor until the elections and I'm going to need someone to spill out the council. I'd like that person to be you"
8728,Damon, Whatever you need Carol. As a founding family member it's something that's very close to me so I would be honored to help keep this town safe from vampires
8729,Damon, Is it safe to talk?
8730,Carol," It's my brother-in-law, Mason. He's still visiting. I just don't want him to hear us. He didn't want any part of the council when he lived here and I see no reason to bring him to it now"
8731,Tyler, When was that? Like seven?
8732,Mason, Six. I don't count the last one. You crawled
8733,Tyler, What?
8734,Mason, I think Grandma Lockwood actually passed you her walker
8735,Tyler," Yeah, okay. Shoes off. Mud, my mom…"
8736,Mason," Yeah, yeah."
8737,Mason," So all this anger and aggression you're talking about, you notices a difference when you exercise?"
8738,Tyler," Dude, I play 3 varsity sports. I work out 4 times a week and run 3, I'm gonna say no "
8739,Mason, Do you have episodes? What happens exactly?
8740,Tyler," Most of time normal, I get angry typically over nothing. I'm an angry guy. I know it just amplifies and I go off"
8741,Mason, You black out?
8742,Tyler," Yeah, it's like I go blind with rage"
8743,Mason," Is there a pattern? Like once a month, only at night?"
8744,Tyler," All I know is I loose myself, you know? For that time I become something else and I hate it"
8745,Carol, More tea? Damon?
8746,Damon," Oh yes, please. Thank you Carol"
8747,Matt, Your mom said you're not eating
8748,Caroline, It's gross
8749,Matt, It's the hospital food; it's supposed to be gross
8750,Matt, She also said you're getting released tomorrow morning
8751,Caroline, Morning? I need to get out tonight
8752,Matt," No, the carnival is going to happen without you Caroline. I know it's hard for your neurotic control freak personality to process but Bonnie and Elena have it"
8753,Caroline, I'm not neurotic
8754,Matt, Yeah you are but it's cute so…
8755,Caroline," Look, it's not about the carnival okay? It's just that this place is just really depressing"
8756,Matt, It's because you're sitting in the dark
8757,Caroline, No don't!
8758,Matt, What the hell?
8759,Caroline, Just close it please
8760,Matt, What's wrong with you?
8761,Caroline, Close it!
8762,Matt, I'll just come back later okay?
8763,Damon, Do you care for one?
8764,Stefan," No, thank you. I'm not hungry, just ate"
8765,Damon," Are you worried that one day, all the forest animals are gonna band together and fight back? I mean, surely they talk"
8766,Stefan, I'm just happy that's it's a bl*od bag and not a sorority girl supplying your dinner
8767,Damon," I like this. You, walking on eggs shores around me because you think I'm gonna explode. Very suspencible. Is Elena worried too? I bet I'm your every conversation"
8768,Stefan, Have you heard from Katherine?
8769,Damon," I think the Lockwood's have a family secret because the Gilbert device affected them but vervain didn't so they're not vampires, they're something else"
8770,Stefan, Is this your new obsession?
8771,Damon," You'd rather some unknown supernatural element running upon our town. Fine, I'll drop it"
8772,Stefan," We haven't seen lots of Katherine, you do know that right? We have no idea what she's up to"
8773,Damon, Sure we do. She came back to profess her undying eternal love for you so I'm gonna let you deal with her because I have more important things to do like explode. Shears!
8774,Nurse, That's pretty
8775,Caroline," Yeah, my friend gave it to me"
8776,Nurse, what's wrong?
8777,Caroline," You can't tell anyone, you can't tell anyone!"
8778,Nurse, I can't tell anyone
8779,Caroline, You'll do what I say?
8780,Nurse, I'll do what you say
8781,Caroline, Good because I'm starving
8782,Bonnie, The ring toss is out of Bart and Homer dolls and team Jacob teas
8783,Elena," Okay, I can grab some from the science club. Also we lost a speaker in the karaoke booth"
8784,Bonnie," Hey, all good Elena, take a breath, look around. This is a huge success"
8785,Elena, You mean I can give more than just freak vampire havoc?
8786,Bonnie, Good
8787,Elena," Hey, Carter right? You're with the carnival"
8788,Carter, That'll be me
8789,Elena," Okay, great"
8790,Carter," Wow, what do you need beautiful?"
8791,Bonnie, What do you know about karaoke speakers?
8792,Carter, Why don't you show me the problem?
8793,Elena," Yeah Bonnie, show him the problem"
8794,Bonnie," Okay, come on"
8795,Tyler, What are you doing?
8796,Mason," Nothing, just k*ll time waiting for you"
8797,Tyler, You're looking for something?
8798,Mason, Yeah actually. You know where I can find any family artifact stuff?
8799,Tyler, You drained your trust fund already?
8800,Mason," I did that when I was 22. No, I'm just looking for this old piece of my mom's. My dad gave it to her when they got married. It's a sentimental value. Probably passed out on your dad. It just still be in the house here somewhere"
8801,Tyler, What's it look like?
8802,Mason," It's a moon stone; it's about the size of a hockey puck. Old, ugly, minimal monetary value"
8803,Tyler," Yeah man, whatever. Ask my mom I guess"
8804,Mason," Yeah, cool, I'll do that. You're ready?"
8805,Tyler, Yeah
8806,Damon," Jeremy, it's so good to see you alive"
8807,Jeremy, Aren't you a little old for a high school carnival?
8808,Damon, A hundred and fifty years too old
8809,Jeremy, You're pretty funny cracking jokes when I could I don't know… led the hold of this thing telling by telling someone what you really are
8810,Damon, So please tell that was not a threat
8811,Jeremy, Maybe it is
8812,Damon, This is what we're not gonna do: we're not gonna walk around like we are invincible when it's this easy for me to end you
8813,Damon, If you want to tell people what I really am go ahead and try
8814,Damon, I will sh*t this ring so far up your ass that you'll really have something to choke on
8815,Caroline," The doctor said I'm good as new, he signed me out, he said that I didn't have to wait ‘til morning so call me when you get this"
8816,Caroline," It's dark, thank god. I'm so sorry about that"
8817,Caroline," Okay, now what's the story?"
8818,Nurse, My husband likes to get kinky
8819,Caroline," Yes, good. Okay, so I'm gonna take off. I'm in the comity chair for the carnival and I'm worried it's a complete disaster. I mean god bless Elena, she's not understand the word fabulous"
8820,Caroline, Once again I'm so sorry about that and if you could just forget that I bit you that would be great because I'm going to
8821,Nurse, Forget what?
8822,Caroline, I don't know how that works but its brilliant
8823,Stefan, You're lurking
8824,Damon, I'm observing
8825,Stefan, It's more like obsessing
8826,Damon, He's got strength
8827,Stefan," He's a triple varsity athlete, of course he has strength. You're reaching"
8828,Mason, I bet I could b*at you
8829,Damon, Enter the uncle
8830,Stefan, That's ridiculous
8831,Tyler," Okay, he's the champ, who wants to go next?"
8832,Damon, Stefan wants to go
8833,Stefan," Yeah, sure, I'll… give it a sh*t"
8834,Damon, Give him Stef!
8835,Stefan, My brother over there thinks I could b*at you
8836,Mason, Your brother's wrong
8837,Damon, You didn't put an effort at all
8838,Stefan," Yeah, actually I did"
8839,Damon, Come with me
8840,Damon, Is he…?
8841,Stefan," No, no, I wasn't that kind of strength but it was more than human, it doesn't make sense"
8842,Damon," What is up with that family? They're not vampires, what the hell are they?"
8843,Stefan, Maybe they're ninja turtles
8844,Damon, You're not funny
8845,Stefan," Or zombies, werewolves"
8846,Damon, No comedic timing at all
8847,Stefan, What? What are you up to?
8848,Damon, Since this is reality and there's no such thing as werewolves or combat turtles
8849,Stefan, Ninja turtles
8850,Damon, Hey you!
8851,Carter, I have a name
8852,Damon, Yeah I don't care
8853,Damon," I need you to pick a fight with someone, a kid named Tyler Lockwood"
8854,Stefan," Damon, don't do this"
8855,Damon," It's just an experiment. Get him mad, don't back down no matter what he does okay?"
8856,Carter, I won't back down
8857,Damon, I know you won't
8858,Stefan, Do you realize someone is going to get hurt right?
8859,Damon," No, someone is going to get mad, as in rage"
8860,Stefan, What's that going to accomplish?
8861,Damon," That Tyler kid is incapable of walking away from a fight. Let's see who intervenes, maybe the ambigus, supernatural mystery uncle"
8862,Damon," Hey Blondie, they let you out?"
8863,Caroline, I remember
8864,Damon, What do you remember?
8865,Caroline," I remember how you manipulated me, you pushed me around, abused me, erased my memories, fed on me"
8866,Damon, You're crazy
8867,Caroline," Memories have been coming back, in pieces"
8868,Damon," You can't remember. It's impossible, I mean unless you're becoming a…"
8869,Caroline," have a message from Katherine, she said ""Game on"""
8870,Damon, Wait…
8871,Caroline, You suck
8872,Damon, Elena
8873,Elena, What do you want Damon?
8874,Damon, I know I'm the last person you want to see right now but I need you to come with me
8875,Elena, Whatever it is I'm not interested
8876,Damon," Yeah, I need you to come with me right now, Elena"
8877,Tyler, Watch where you are going
8878,Carter, You got a problem?
8879,Tyler," Yeah, you walked right into me"
8880,Carter, What are you going to do about it?
8881,Tyler, You're kidding right?
8882,Tyler, You better back off
8883,Tyler," You hit me again, I swear to god…"
8884,Mason, What the hell man?
8885,Tyler, Your eyes
8886,Stefan, You're alright man?
8887,Carter, Why did I just do that?
8888,Stefan, You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time
8889,Matt, What are you doing here?
8890,Caroline," They discharged me, I'm better"
8891,Matt, How do you feel?
8892,Caroline, I feel pretty good
8893,Matt," Yeah, ‘cause earlier you were…"
8894,Caroline, I'm all better
8895,Caroline, All better
8896,Matt," Okay, you want to give it a sh*t?"
8897,Matt," Wow, hey, nice sh*t k*ll"
8898,Caroline, They must already have been broken
8899,Caroline, Oh no
8900,Matt, What's wrong?
8901,Caroline, I got to go
8902,Matt," Wait Caro, are you okay, I mean…"
8903,Caroline, Just leave me alone!
8904,Caroline, How did this happen?
8905,Damon," Well, I fed her bl*od and Katherine obviously k*ll her and a plus b equals…"
8906,Elena, But why?
8907,Damon, Because Katherine is a manipulative nasty little slut
8908,Stefan," And she said ""game on""? What is that even mean?"
8909,Damon," It means she's playing dirty, she wants us to know"
8910,Elena, But why Caroline?
8911,Damon, I don't know
8912,Stefan," Caroline must be completely out of her mind, she don't even know what's happening to her"
8913,Damon, Oh I think she does. All of my compulsion from the past sort of wiring of the minute she was in transition
8914,Stefan, We have to find her
8915,Damon, Yep and k*ll her
8916,Elena, You're not gonna k*ll Caroline
8917,Damon," She knows who we are, she's officially a liability, and we've got to get rid of her"
8918,Stefan," Damon, absolutely not"
8919,Damon," Need I to remind you the tragic little story of a girl named Vicki Donovan? Caroline, of all people, won't not make it as a vampire. Her mother is a vampire hunter. Guys come on, we all know how this story's gonna end, just flip to the last chapter and…"
8920,Elena, It's not an option Damon
8921,Damon," No? Your silence is defining, Stefan. Wait, wasn't there a school carnival the night you staked Vicki?"
8922,Stefan, we're not gonna k*ll her
8923,Damon, It's the only way
8924,Carter," Hey, is everything okay?"
8925,Caroline, I'm so sorry
8926,Carter, What?
8927,Matt," She's obviously pissed at me for something but for what, no clue"
8928,Bonnie, What happened?
8929,Matt, She freaked out and she's been like that all day. Cool one minute and crazy and neurotic next
8930,Bonnie," She almost died, it's must be messing with her head. Plus, she's Caroline"
8931,Matt," Yeah, I'm used to the insecurity and all that. This is who she is, love it or hate it but this seemed I don't know… different. I can't explain it"
8932,Elena," You're agreed with Damon, don't you? Stefan?"
8933,Stefan," Damon's right, not about what we should do but about what's gonna happen. Katherine has decided Caroline's death sentence"
8934,Elena, We can't let it in that way. She's doing this to me isn't she?
8935,Stefan," No, she's doing it to me"
8936,Tyler," Well, we're home. Safe territory, enough with the silence"
8937,Mason, I told you to leave it alone
8938,Tyler, What was that move you pulled?
8939,Mason," Brazilian martial art, I took some classes a while back"
8940,Tyler, Don't lie to me!
8941,Mason, I'm not lying
8942,Tyler, I saw something!
8943,Mason, You didn't see anything
8944,Tyler," I saw your eyes, they glowed"
8945,Mason," Reflection of a car headlight maybe, that's all"
8946,Tyler, Reflection of a car headlight…
8947,Mason, Yes
8948,Tyler, You really expect me to believe that?
8949,Mason, Tyler! You want to know what you saw? You saw me get pissed of that I had to put your delinquent ass out of a fight!
8950,Elena," Where could she be? What is it? Do you hear her? What's going on Stefan, what is it?"
8951,Stefan," bl*od, I smell bl*od"
8952,Caroline," He's dead, I k*ll him. What's wrong with me?"
8953,Damon," Hey, hey it's okay. I can help you"
8954,Caroline, You can?
8955,Damon," Yeah, I have to"
8956,Caroline, What are you gonna do?
8957,Damon," The only thing I can do, I'm gonna k*ll you"
8958,Caroline, Please don't! I don't want to die!
8959,Damon, Yeah but you are already dead
8960,Caroline," No, I'm not. Don't say that okay? Just help me!"
8961,Damon, Okay
8962,Caroline," Okay? Just help me please! Please, please!"
8963,Damon," Okay, okay"
8964,Damon, Stefan!
8965,Caroline, Get away from me! You k*ll me!
8966,Elena," No, no, no, no Caroline! That wasn't me. You know that! That was Katherine"
8967,Caroline," No! Then why did she look like you?! And why, why did she do this to me?"
8968,Elena," Stefan, we've got to get her inside"
8969,Stefan," It's okay Caroline, come with me"
8970,Damon," She'll die, it's only a matter of time"
8971,Stefan, Yeah but it's not gonna happen tonight
8972,Damon, Oh yeah it is
8973,Elena," Damon, she's my friend"
8974,Damon," Whatever happens, it's on you"
8975,Bonnie, Caroline?
8976,Stefan," It's okay, come on"
8977,Bonnie," No, you're not, it can't be"
8978,Caroline, Bonnie?
8979,Elena, Oh god!
8980,Caroline, She hates me! Bonnie hates me
8981,Stefan," No, she's just in shock, we all are"
8982,Caroline, And what about Matt?
8983,Stefan," Shut. One thing at one time, let' get this bl*od off, come on"
8984,Caroline, I'm a m*rder. I'm a monster!
8985,Stefan," Look at me, your emotions are highing right now, it's part of the transformation, it's completely normal, I promise you okay?"
8986,Caroline, Why is this keeping happening to my face?
8987,Stefan," Look at me, look at me, look at me! Caroline, Caroline! Look at me! Look at my face, look at my face!"
8988,Stefan," You see that? When you feel the bl*od rushing, you tell yourself that you're going to get through it, that you're strong enough. Yes, yes, no matter how good it feels to get yourself over to it, you fight it off, you burry it. Watch me, watch me"
8989,Stefan, It's the only way you're gonna to survive this thing. Try
8990,Stefan, That's good
8991,Caroline, Why did Katherine do this to me?
8992,Stefan," I don't know, I wish I did. Hey, hey, I promise you I will not let anything happen to you. Come here"
8993,Bonnie, I can't believe this is happening
8994,Damon," Come on, don't pout about it, I've got a body to bury"
8995,Damon," I thought you were calling the shots, no? It sucks to be you buddy"
8996,Bonnie, I told you what would happen if anyone else got hurt 
8997,Damon, I didn't do this
8998,Elena," Bonnie, it wasn't his fault"
8999,Bonnie, Everything that happens is his fault Elena
9000,Elena," Bonnie, what are you doing?"
9001,Elena, Bonnie stop it!
9002,Elena," Bonnie, stop! You're going to k*ll him?"
9003,Elena," Bonnie, stop!"
9004,Bonnie, Why did you stop me?
9005,Elena," Because this isn't us. Bonnie, this can't be us"
9006,Stefan," Hey. Caroline is okay for now, I'm gonna check on her later"
9007,Elena, What about the guy she…
9008,Stefan, It's taking care of
9009,Elena," Damon's right, isn't he? It won't end her for her"
9010,Stefan," No, I'm gonna make sure that he's wrong"
9011,Elena, I just can't believe what this day has turned into
9012,Stefan, Not a normal day uh?
9013,Elena," I was stupid to think that it could be. I mean, nothing about my life is normal. My best friend is a witch, my friend is a vampire and I have a doppelgänger who wants to destroy all of us"
9014,Stefan, I'm sorry
9015,Elena," No, it's not your fault, Stefan. T's no one's fault you know? It is what it is"
9016,Elena," I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just that… you know what? I'm fine. I'm gonna to call you tomorrow okay? Good night Stefan"
9017,Stefan, Good night
9018,Carol, I think it's good for Tyler to have you in the house
9019,Mason, I appreciate that Carol
9020,Carol," Oh, and I can see If I can dig up that stone you're looking for. It's bound to be tucked away in one of Richard's knocks and crannies"
9021,Mason," Hey man, you're heading up?"
9022,Tyler, In a minute. Good night mom
9023,Carol, Good night Tyler
9024,Mason," Hey, I'm sorry about earlier, we're all good?"
9025,Tyler," yeah, we're good"
9026,Mason, Alright
9027,Damon, What the hell are you doing here?
9028,Jeremy, You don't lock your front door
9029,Damon, Yeah
9030,Jeremy, No I wouldn't… I lasted it with vervain
9031,Damon, Why would you do that?
9032,Jeremy, So I could stake you… with this
9033,Damon, You came here to k*ll me?
9034,Jeremy," It's only fair, you k*ll me first"
9035,Damon, What made your eyes went up?
9036,Jeremy," My father hated vampires, my uncle too. They were absolute they knew exactly what they stood for and I figured maybe I should too. I mean, stand for something but k*ll you, what's that gonna do?"
9037,Damon," Look, I don't do the big brother thing very well. Sorry, I don't have any milk and cookie stuff for you"
9038,Jeremy, Dick
9039,Damon, Wait. My fathers hated vampires too
9040,Jeremy, He did?
9041,Damon," For the same reasons your dad did. Only it was 1864, people knew how to woodle"
9042,Damon, Did you do this?
9043,Jeremy, Yeah I tried; it's harder than it looks
9044,Caroline, What are you doing here?
9045,Matt, I came to see if today's bask period has expired
9046,Caroline, You know you should just go ‘cause my mom is gonna be home soon
9047,Matt," You've been dodging me all day. I mean, I'm more insecure than you are now"
9048,Caroline, What do you mean?
9049,Matt," It means that… you almost died and it freaked me out and it got me thinking you know ‘cause… I'm not in a position where I can lose someone else right now. I realized, even though today I wanted to throttle you, I'm pretty sure that I'm in love with you and I it seems like you don't feel the same way"
9050,Elena, What time is it?
9051,Stefan, It's almost dawn. Come with me
9052,Elena, Stefan what are we doing here? We're going to get caught
9053,Stefan, I compelled the guard to on break so I could kiss my girlfriend at the top of the Ferris wheel
9054,Elena, Stefan…
9055,Stefan," We have to take these moments, Elena. What Katherine did to Caroline could just be the beginning and there are things with Tyler's family that we don't even understand yet and there's always a ""D"" word but I came back to this town to start a life with you. We can't forget to live it"
9056,Elena," But Stefan, how are you going to the top?"
9057,Stefan, I guess you'll just have to hold on time
9058,Elena, What?
9059,Stefan, It's just so nice to see you laugh
9060,Elena," It's not going to get any easier, is it?"
9061,Stefan," No, it's not"
9062,Stefan," Thanks for coming, Rick"
9063,Damon," I got you something to drink? Coffee, bourbon? Bourbon into coffee?"
9064,Alaric, Elena mentioned you needed my help
9065,Stefan," Yeah, we were hoping you could help sheet some light on the Lockwood family"
9066,Alaric," Now, why would I know anything about the Lockwood's?"
9067,Damon, Why you wouldn't? But your dead not dead vampire wife might
9068,Elena, Isobel's research from when you guys were at Duke together
9069,Stefan, You said that she has spent years researching this town
9070,Alaric, Isobel's research here in Mystic Falls rounded in folklores and legends but at the time I thought much of which was fiction
9071,Damon, Like that amazing vampire story
9072,Elena," Aside from vampires, what else"
9073,Alaric, The lycanthrope
9074,Elena," Wait, like werewolves?"
9075,Damon," No way, impossible, way too launchy"
9076,Stefan, Is it?
9077,Damon," I've been on this planet one hundred and sixty some on years, never came across one. If werewolves exist, where the hell are they?"
9078,Alaric, Why do you suspect the Lockwood's?
9079,Damon, Because vervein didn't affect the mayor at founder's day but the Gilbert device did and it affected his son Tyler
9080,Stefan, And at the school carnival his uncle Mason exhibited inhuman behavior when he fell into the carnival's worker
9081,Stefan, It suggest it's some sort of a supernatural entity
9082,Elena, We were hoping that Isobel's research could help us figure it out what it is
9083,Alaric," Well, all her things are still at Duke. I mean her office is still there, she's technically still missing"
9084,Damon, So can we get access to it?
9085,Damon," Rick, we don't know what we are dealing with. If this wolf men thing is true, we have seen enough movies to know it's not good. It means Mason Lockwood is a real life Lon Chaney and that Tyler punk may just very well be Lon Chaney junior which means Bella Lugosi, meaning me, is totally screwed"
9086,Matt, Caroline!
9087,Matt," Hey, I thought you said you were home. Hey, Tyler is doing this whole thing at swimming hall and I want us to spend the day together. Where are you? Call me"
9088,Stefan, Are you sure you want to do this?
9089,Elena, Which part? Digging through my birth mother life work or going to Duke with Damon?
9090,Stefan," Either, both"
9091,Elena," Well, I'm not sure about the first part but then again Rick is a good buffer so I can bond in our anti Damon solidarity. I wish you were coming though"
9092,Stefan, You know what? Maybe we should wait a couple days uh? Wait until Caroline is less of a danger and then I could go with you
9093,Elena," It's okay that I'm going, right? And be honest because if it's not then I can just stay here and we could take care of Caroline"
9094,Stefan," Listen, I want you do go okay? I do. You have questions about your lineage and about Katherine and… look I'm not gonna let the fact that Damon is going keep you from an opportunity to get some answers"
9095,Elena, You hate it though
9096,Stefan, I hate it but I love you
9097,Elena, love you too
9098,Jenna, It's been a while
9099,Alaric," Well, the school has been keeping me busy"
9100,Jenna, I want you to know it means a lot to me that Elena has a connection to her mother. I appreciate you bring her along today
9101,Alaric," Yeah, I figured it was time to take care of my wife's things you know. Look Jenna, I know things between you and I have been a little start and stop and I'm sorry for that but maybe once I can…"
9102,Jenna," Uh…no, don't do that. Not the half maybe apology hope for the future thing"
9103,Jenna, Elena?! Are you coming?
9104,Jenna, Do what you need to do okay?
9105,Elena," Hey, are you okay?"
9106,Jenna," Yeah, it's man and their baggage"
9107,Damon," Sorry you can't go too, Steph"
9108,Stefan, Call me if you need anything
9109,Damon," Oh, I'll take really good care of her"
9110,Damon," Okay, time to go"
9111,Tyler, Have you ever been down to those old ruins in the woods?
9112,Carol, The old Lockwood estate?
9113,Tyler, Yeah. What do you know about it?
9114,Carol, It was the original plantation house. Beautiful architecture and if it hadn't burn to the ground we'd probably living in it
9115,Tyler, What's the deal with the freaky underground cellar?
9116,Carol, We don't talk about those kinds of rooms
9117,Tyler, Why not?
9118,Carol," Well, this is the South, honey, but no one likes to reminisce about the old slave days"
9119,Mason, Hey. What you guys are talking about?
9120,Tyler, We were just talking about the old Lockwood property. Taking some friends over the swim hole
9121,Carol," Well, be careful. If anything happens on the property the family is liable"
9122,Tyler, Off course
9123,Bonnie, I don't know how to make a day-walking ring
9124,Stefan," Emily made mine, she made Damon's too, instructions must be in the grimoire"
9125,Bonnie, That doesn't mean I can cuss the spell
9126,Stefan," Bonnie, you know how to drop vampires with a single look, okay? I think you can figure it out"
9127,Bonnie," Caroline k*ll someone, Stefan. I can't make it easier for her to do it again"
9128,Stefan," No, we're not making it easier for her; we're just giving her the chance to survive. Listen, every day that she's cut off from her old life: from you, from Elena, from Matt, it'll make It that much harder for her to hold on to her humanity"
9129,Bonnie, And how do you know she won't hurt anyone else?
9130,Stefan," I don't but if we don't do everything we can to help her or at least trust the fact that she can keep it together, we must just stake her right now"
9131,Bonnie," I don't know if I can trust her, not with this"
9132,Stefan, Then trust me
9133,Damon," How are you doing back there? You know, this all pretending to hate me thing is getting a little silly"
9134,Alaric, I don't think she's pretending. You did k*ll her brother
9135,Damon, There is a huge asterisk next to that statement: he came back to life
9136,Elena," Yeah, thanks to a ring you didn't know he was wearing"
9137,Damon, Why are you so sure I didn't know?
9138,Elena, Did you?
9139,Damon, Yes
9140,Elena, You're lying
9141,Damon," Elena, I saw the ring! It's a big tacky thing, it's hard to miss"
9142,Caroline," So, I don't get to choose the ring I have to wear the rest of my life? "
9143,Bonnie," Hey, if you don't want it…"
9144,Stefan," No, no, she wants it"
9145,Caroline, Now what?
9146,Bonnie, Now is the part where I explain the rules. The witch who spells the ring has the power to dispel it so if you ever do anything to hurt anyone…
9147,Caroline, I'm not gonna hurt anyone
9148,Bonnie," You are a vampire that mean that urge to k*ll is a part of who you are. The minute you let it take over, "
9149,Caroline," Bonnie, you're supposed to be my friend"
9150,Bonnie," I can't ignore what happened okay? If you want to be friends, you have to prove that the Caroline I "
9151,Caroline, Do you really think I meant to k*ll that guy at the carnival?
9152,Bonnie," He's still dead. Now, do you want me to cuss the spell or not?"
9153,Bonnie, All done
9154,Caroline," So that's it? I mean nothing witchy happened. You know, no flickering lights, no gust of wind. Have"
9155,Stefan, Caroline…
9156,Caroline, I just want to make sure that worked
9157,Bonnie, It worked
9158,Caroline, What if it hadn't Bonnie ?!
9159,Bonnie, She's all yours
9160,Alaric, So Isobel was officially employed by the anthropology department given that most paranormal
9161,Alaric," Excuse me, hi. I'm Alaric Saltzman, I called earlier"
9162,Vanessa," Yes, of course. I'm Vanessa Monroe, research assistant compare to folklore"
9163,Vanessa," Uh, let me just grab Isobel's keys"
9164,Alaric, These are my friends Elena and Damon. I hope this isn't too much of an imposition
9165,Vanessa," Oh please, Isobel's office is right through there. Isobel's was one of my first professors. I'm a grad"
9166,Alaric," No, I'm afraid not"
9167,Vanessa, It's this way
9168,Vanessa," I'll grab the light, feel free to look around. It's fascinating isn't it?"
9169,Damon, Where did she go?
9170,Damon, Put it out. I can't reach it Elena. Just put the damn thing out. It hurts
9171,Damon, That bitch is dead
9172,Elena, You're not gonna k*ll her
9173,Damon, Watch me
9174,Elena, You touch her and I swear I will never speak to you again
9175,Damon, What makes you think that has any power over me? Because I took an arrow in the back for you? You're so overestimating yourself
9176,Elena," Right. I forgot that I was speaking to a psychotic mind who snaps and k*ll people impulsively. Fine, go ahead, do whatever you want"
9177,Damon, you're trying to manipulate me
9178,Elena," If by ""manipulate"" you mean ""tell the truth"" okay, guilty"
9179,Vanessa," Please! I freaked out okay? Alright, you would have done the same thing, it's not possible! Katherine Pierce can't be alive and Damon Salvatore died in 1864. Okay, I read Isobel's research"
9180,Alaric," Well, you should know just how possible this is"
9181,Elena," I'm Elena Gilbert, Isobel's daughter and a descendant of Katherine Pierce. And this is Damon Salvatore who you just sh*t"
9182,Damon, I'd be extra nice to me right now
9183,Elena," Look, we need your help okay? We need to see all of Isobel's research, anything related to Mystic Falls"
9184,Caroline, So what I do when I see the rabbit?
9185,Stefan," Chase it, catch it, feed on it"
9186,Caroline, Isn't k*ll cute defenseless animals the first step of becoming a serial k*ll?
9187,Stefan," Well, you sort of skipped the serial k*ll and went straight to vampire. Caroline, if you're not serious about all of this I think you should tell me"
9188,Caroline," No I am. Look, I swear that I am okay? But it's just… I haven't been in the sun for days and everyone is at the swimming hole having fun and Matt is there! And he finally told me that he loved me but I have been blowing him off and now you want me to eat bunnies and I'm kind of freaking out okay?!"
9189,Caroline, And now you're laughing at me
9190,Stefan," No, no, I'm not laughing. None of this is funny, trust me. It's just that…"
9191,Caroline, What?!
9192,Stefan," When someone becomes a vampire, all of their natural behaviors get sort of amplified"
9193,Caroline, What do you mean?
9194,Stefan," I mean… as a human I cared deeply for people, how they felt. If they were hurting I felt their pain and I felt guilty if I was the one who caused it and as a vampire all of that got… magnified"
9195,Caroline," So you're saying that now I'm basically an insecure, neurotic control freak... on crack?"
9196,Stefan," Well, I wouldn't say it like that but… hey, listen, let's hunt okay? And then after that we'll go to the swimming hole"
9197,Caroline, Really?
9198,Stefan, Yeah. Matt is the closest connection that you have to your humanity and I think that being around him is a good thing
9199,Caroline, Okay
9200,Vanessa, This box checks Katherine's arrival to Mystic Falls in April 1864
9201,Elena, Is that all there is about her?
9202,Vanessa, All that I'm aware of
9203,Elena," Here, take this"
9204,Vanessa, Does vervein really work?
9205,Damon," Nope, not at all"
9206,Vanessa, Can he hear us?
9207,Damon," No, that would be creepy"
9208,Vanessa, Can he read minds too?
9209,Damon," You know, if you want to see me naked, all you have to do is ask"
9210,Elena," No, that he can't do. He is very capable of being a first grade jackass"
9211,Tyler, Is it me or did Amy Bradley's ass get hot
9212,Matt, All class
9213,Tyler, Where is Forbes?
9214,Matt, I wish I knew
9215,Tyler, You guys are in the outs already?
9216,Matt, No. We're fine. I'm fine. I'm just not sure what she is
9217,Matt, What's your uncle doing here?
9218,Tyler, You're busting us or you're joining us?
9219,Mason, Neither. Hoping you can make sure everyone is out of here by dark
9220,Tyler, What happens after dark?
9221,Mason, Someone ends up wasted and dead at the bottom of the lake
9222,Mason, You heard your mom. The family is liable if anything happens
9223,Tyler, Don't be a party k*ll
9224,Mason," Hey, I didn't say you had to stop partying, I just said you had to take it elsewhere"
9225,Tyler," Alright, we'll be out of here"
9226,Caroline, Why are you looking at him with this serious vampire look?
9227,Stefan," My what? My ""vampire serious look""?"
9228,Caroline," Hum hum. I mean it's different from your worried vampire look, neither of which straight too far from your ""hey-it's-Tuesday"" look"
9229,Stefan," I get it, okay. You think I'm… you think I'm too serious"
9230,Caroline, I mean I was not gonna say it like that but…
9231,Matt, Hey Amy
9232,Aimee," You know, you're missing all the fun in the water"
9233,Matt, No waterproof
9234,Aimee," Too bad. So, there's the full moon tonight. We're gonna light a fire later and tells ghost stories"
9235,Matt," Uh, I don't know"
9236,Caroline, Matt
9237,Matt, What the hell? I've been calling you
9238,Caroline," know, I got held up but I'm here now"
9239,Aimee, Hi Caroline
9240,Caroline," Go find somebody single to stuck, Amy"
9241,Matt, Seriously?
9242,Caroline, She was flirting with you
9243,Matt, She's harmless; you don't have to be rude
9244,Caroline, You're mad?
9245,Matt," You've been dodging my calls all day and you get to show up here and be the jealous girlfriend? It' kind of lame, Care"
9246,Stefan," Hey, I saw that. You compelled her"
9247,Caroline," Yeah, she deserved it"
9248,Stefan," Caroline, nobody deserve to have their mind mess for shallow reasons"
9249,Caroline," You know, why is everyone sticking for Amy freaking Bradley? "
9250,Stefan, you're letting the jealousy to get the best of you
9251,Caroline," Oh, so now I have magnified jealousy issues too. It's great"
9252,Stefan, I told you this wasn't gonna be easy
9253,Caroline," Yeah, well, I would have to stay dead. My entire personality is k*ll me"
9254,Caroline, Shut up
9255,Damon, Any luck?
9256,Elena, There's nothing in here about Katherine that we don't already know
9257,Damon," Ah, you know, it's a bummer we're not friends anymore because I could tell you what I know"
9258,Elena, Now who's manipulating who?
9259,Alaric," Hey guys, check this out"
9260,Vanessa, There's no record of werewolf mythology in Mystic Falls but here are some records of some the lesser known legends. Everything from Scandinavian skin walkers to Aztecs legends.
9261,Vanessa," It's translate into the ""curse of the sun and the moon"""
9262,Alaric, It's Native American
9263,Vanessa," Aztecs. It explains one origin of the werewolf curse traced through Virginia. The short story: 600 years ago, the Aztecs were played by werewolves and vampires. They terrorized the countryside, made farming and hunting impossible until an Aztec shaman cursed them, making vampires slaves to the sun and werewolves servants of the moon. As a result, vampires could only prowl at night and werewolves could only turn on a full moon. When the full moon is crossing the sky, who's ever unlucky enough to fall into the werewolves curse turns into a wolf."
9264,Damon, Can they control the transformation?
9265,Vanessa," If it were a choice, it wouldn't be called a curse. Werewolves will attack humans but instinct and centuries of rivalry have hardware them to hunt their prey's choice: vampires"
9266,Damon," Well, if werewolves were hunting vampires, I would know about it"
9267,Vanessa, Not if they aren't many werewolves left alive. Hundreds of years ago vampires hunted them almost to extinction
9268,Elena, Why would they do that?
9269,Vanessa," To protect themselves. According to the legend, a werewolf bite is fatal to the vampires"
9270,Caroline, He's mad at me
9271,Stefan, Go talk to him. I'll wait
9272,(Stefan's phone is ringing. He answer it, it's Elena)
9273,Stefan, Hey
9274,Elena, Hi. Listen we've learn some stuff here and I know it's gonna sound crazy but I want you to know
9275,Stefan, What's up?
9276,Caroline, Still mad?
9277,Matt," I thought we had passed all this insecurity stuff, Caroline. I told you how I felt about you, what more do you need?"
9278,Caroline," Nothing. Nothing. I don't need anything else. I'm sorry Matt, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so, so, so sorry."
9279,Matt, I'm not kidding. I'm not gonna put up with the drama
9280,Caroline," No, no more drama. Just… I promise"
9281,Matt, Come on
9282,Elena, I don't know what that means nor if we should believe it but it's the full moon Stefan. After what you saw Mason Lockwood do
9283,Stefan, I'll be careful
9284,Elena, There's one more thing
9285,Stefan, What is it?
9286,Elena," According to the legend, a werewolf bite can k*ll a vampire"
9287,Stefan," Listen, I got to go. I'll see you when you get home okay?"
9288,Elena, Okay
9289,Tyler, Not much further Aimee
9290,Aimee, Really Tyler? You drove me all the way out here?
9291,Tyler, I had to move the party so I'm moving the party
9292,Aimee, Where are we going?
9293,Tyler, It's right around this tree
9294,Aimee, Are you sure?
9295,Tyler," Oh yeah, come on"
9296,Aimee, What is this place?
9297,Tyler, It's a ruin buried underneath my family's old estate. No one would know we're down here
9298,Aimee, Is everyone else coming?
9299,Tyler," Yeah, unless you rather tell them not to"
9300,Aimee, You're single right?
9301,Tyler, Oh yeah
9302,Aimee, Let's go
9303,Elena," Hey, have you done any research on doppelgangers?"
9304,Vanessa," Well, the world means a lot of different things to different cultures but typically a doppelganger is a "
9305,Elena, Did Isobel have anything that explains the link between me and Katherine?
9306,Vanessa," That's all she had on Katherine, unfortunately but I can tell you that doppelgangers usually torment"
9307,Elena, And more things we already know. Just… I want to know why we look alike
9308,Damon, Head scratcher isn't it?
9309,Elena, Do you know something or are you just being yourself?
9310,Damon," Well, if I know anything, I'm not gonna tell you with that attitude"
9311,Elena," That's good, Damon and this is coming from someone who wants to be my friend but you know what? "
9312,Aimee," Wait, wait. No, I'm sorry"
9313,Tyler, What's the deal? Come on
9314,Aimee," No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, I can't. I'm not into it"
9315,Tyler, Then why did you come with me?
9316,Aimee, I don't know but I'm not even sure I was flirting with you. I like Matt
9317,Tyler, Ouch. Um… okay
9318,Aimee, ‘m gonna go
9319,Tyler, Yeah
9320,Aimee, Sorry
9321,Alaric, I trust you're not gonna say anything about this to anyone
9322,Vanessa," Or else Damon will k*ll me in my sleep? He gave me the form but if you need anything, you can call"
9323,Alaric, Hopefully I won't have to
9324,Vanessa, But if you do…
9325,Alaric," Listen, you don't want to get caught up in this. Really, it'll take over and will keep from being able to live your life"
9326,Vanessa, Isobel's disappearance… is it related to her research?
9327,Alaric, Isobel became her research. She wanted to become a vampire and she got her wish
9328,Vanessa, I guess that would put a strain on the marriage
9329,Alaric," Anyway, I was wondering what it would be to come back here. It's… it's okay, it's really okay. It feels good to have her in my past. You know, it' time to move behind this"
9330,Damon, You're not gonna be able to hate me forever
9331,Elena, Can we just go?
9332,Damon, You didn't dig deep enough
9333,Elena," ""Petrova"". I saw it on the shelf"
9334,Damon," Katherine originally came from Europe. Petrova was her real name. Katarina Petrova, to be exact"
9335,Elena, How did you know that?
9336,Damon," Back when, I saw it graved on an old heirloom. Men snoop too, you know. Let me know what you find, I'm very curious myself"
9337,Damon," You have every right to hate me, I understand but you hated me before and we became friends. It would suck if that was gone forever. So, is it? Have I lost you forever?"
9338,Elena," Thank you for the book, Damon"
9339,Matt, This looks like the spot
9340,Caroline, For what?
9341,Matt, Did you hear that?
9342,Matt, Caroline? What are you doing? Ah! Caroline! Caroline!
9343,Matt, Caroline! Your face!
9344,Stefan, Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop!
9345,Caroline, Oh my god
9346,Stefan," No, no, stop. Listen to me. We need to get out of these woods now. We need to leave"
9347,Caroline, What was that?
9348,Stefan," Matt, stay down. Do not move"
9349,Stefan," You and me we're gonna run. It's going to follow us; we need to get it away from Matt. You need to run as far as you can. Do you understand me? Go, go!"
9350,Caroline, Wait! What is it?!
9351,Stefan, It's a werewolf! He will try to k*ll us and he can!
9352,Tyler, Hey! What are you two doing?
9353,Stefan, What are you doing?
9354,Tyler, No!
9355,Caroline, You're not going to remember what I did to you or what you saw me become
9356,Matt, We were just making out in the woods
9357,Caroline, And then an animal attacked you and bite your neck
9358,Matt, It's weird; he just came out of nowhere
9359,Caroline, What are we gonna do about Tyler?
9360,Stefan," I took care of it and I will get Matt on vervein, it'll keep you from being able to compel him and also to keep you from drinking his bl*od"
9361,Caroline, I can believe I hurt him
9362,Stefan, I know
9363,Caroline, He is the one person on this entire planet that I never wanted to hurt
9364,Stefan, It's not going to get any easier. You just have to work that much harder
9365,Caroline," I shouldn't be with him, should i? Because if there is any danger…"
9366,Stefan," I'm the last person to make that kind of decision for you. If I had follow my own advice, I would walked away from Elena a long time ago"
9367,Caroline, Have you ever think you should have?
9368,Stefan," I know I should have, I just can't"
9369,Mason, You can pass me those?
9370,Tyler, It was you
9371,Caroline, Seriously Aimee?
9372,Aimee, We were just talking
9373,Caroline," Oh, that's how you call it?"
9374,Aimee, Yeah
9375,Matt, Are you kidding me?
9376,Caroline," No, I'm not Matt. She's into you and anyone can see it"
9377,Aimee," Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to… I'm just gonna go"
9378,Matt, What are you doing?
9379,Caroline," This isn't my fault Matt, okay? She's after you and I shouldn't have to put up with that"
9380,Matt, I thought you said no more drama?
9381,Caroline," Well, I lied"
9382,Matt," Just forget it, just forget all of it"
9383,Caroline," So what, are you like breaking up with me?"
9384,Matt," Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's what I'm doing"
9385,Jenna," Rick, I wasn't expecting you and Elena so later"
9386,Alaric, I should have done that this morning
9387,Damon, Road trips work well for us
9388,Elena," That doesn't mean that things are back to the way they used to be, Damon"
9389,Damon, Oh come on! You know I chipped a little bit off your wall of hatred
9390,Elena," I need to know the truth. When you broke Jeremy's neck, did you that he was wearing the ring?"
9391,Damon," No. No, I didn't. Katherine really pissed me off and I snapped and… I got lucky with the ring. I don't know what I would done of he wasn't wearing it. Elena, I'm sorry"
9392,Elena," Thank you for being honest with me and the answer to your question, about our friendship is yes. You have lost me forever"
9393,Damon," You knew that already, didn't you? You used me today"
9394,Elena, You had information about Katherine that I needed to know
9395,Damon, I thought friends don't manipulate friends. You and Katherine have a lot more in common than just your looks 
9396,Caroline, Elena?
9397,Katherine," Nope, try again"
9398,Caroline, Katherine
9399,Katherine, Don't be frightened. We're going to have so much fun together
9400,Katherine, Look who found his dancing shoes
9401,Katherine, No touching Mr. Salvatore. Those are the rules
9402,Stefan, I thought you didn't believe in rules
9403,Stefan, My brother is still upset that you chose me to escort you
9404,Katherine," Well, Damon needs to concede that his younger brother is a better dancer"
9405,Katherine, Looks like he found someone to occupies time
9406,Stefan, Elena
9407,Katherine, Stefan don't
9408,Stefan, Elena!
9409,Elena, It's your turn
9410,Damon, Prepare to loose
9411,Katherine," It hurts, doesn't it?"
9412,Katherine, Now you know how I feel. Don't fight it Stefan. You loved me once. You can love me again
9413,Katherine," I love you, Stefan. We'll be together again, I promise. "
9414,Elena," Hey, are you okay?"
9415,Stefan," Yeah. Yes, bad dream. Get back to sleep"
9416,Stefan, Katherine
9417,Katherine, You have to admit I am getting better at this
9418,Katherine, It was easy to get inside of your head. Have you completely forsaken your nature?
9419,Katherine, Are we really gonna do this again? You both know I could rip you to shreds and do my nails at the same time
9420,Stefan, What do you want?
9421,Katherine," I wanted to see you. I missed you, Stefan. Dole me for a little while, please?"
9422,Stefan, Why are you back in town?
9423,Katherine," 3 reasons: you, you and you"
9424,Stefan," You see, I can't quite get that down. Just kind of… get stuck in my throat "
9425,Katherine," Well, you know, it's the truth. Deep down inside that gorgeous body of yours there's the Stefan that fell in love with me too"
9426,Elena, What do you want?
9427,Damon," So, this is where you spend your time when you're not stabbing people in the back"
9428,Elena," I tricked you into telling me the truth that's not stabbing you in the back, it's using your own tactics against you "
9429,Damon, Where are you going?
9430,Elena," I made myself clear, Damon. I want nothing to do with you"
9431,Damon, Okay. See you at Jenna's barbecue
9432,Elena, How did you know about Jenna's barbecue?
9433,Damon, It was my idea. Jenna went to high school with Mason Lockwood so I figured a social gathering would be a good way to get to know the guy. So I told Rick to told Jenna and…
9434,Elena, Does Jenna knows that you're going to be there because she's not exactly a fan of yours
9435,Damon, Perfect. Thank you. I'm hoping this peach cobbler will pave the way
9436,Elena, What are you up to?
9437,Damon, I'm gonna put some silver into Mason Lockwood and prove he is a werewolf. See you at the barbecue
9438,Tyler," Hey, Mason, got a second?"
9439,Mason," No, men, barbecue at Jenna Sommers' house"
9440,Tyler," Come on man; give me two minutes, alright? You can't keep dodging me. I'm freaking out over here!"
9441,Mason," Tyler, what do you want me to say man? Yes, I turned into wolf. No, it's not gonna happen to you"
9442,Tyler, How do you know that?
9443,Mason, Because you're not gonna trigger the curse. Your dad didn't know anything about any of this neither did I until it happened to me
9444,Tyler, How does it get triggered?
9445,Mason," Ignorance is a bless, trust me"
9446,Tyler, You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret and you expect me not to ask questions?
9447,Mason," I can't say anything more, I'm sorry, Tyler. It's just better for you if I don't"
9448,Tyler, You've found that moon stone?
9449,Mason, Do you know where it is?
9450,Tyler, What's so special about it?
9451,Mason," I told you, it was my mom's. It's sentimental. Look, just don't worry about it. Forget I even brought it up, alright?"
9452,Stefan, You shouldn't read someone's journal
9453,Katherine," I know. I'm sorry. It was just too tempting, all of your inner thoughts and feelings, laying there on your desk waiting for me to read"
9454,Stefan, Damon's private stock
9455,Katherine," That's right! You don't do human, I read that. I also read about your recent werewolf siting. That must have come as a surprise"
9456,Stefan, What do you know about werewolves? 
9457,Katherine," I know not to pet one. Their bite k*ll, Stefan. It's best to stay clear during a full moon. "
9458,Stefan, And… how do you know this?
9459,Katherine, Who do you think was responsible for ridding this town of vampires in 1864?
9460,Stefan, Founding families
9461,Katherine, Spearheaded by?
9462,Stefan, The Lockwood's
9463,Katherine," You remember the founder's ball, don't you? The one that you were dreaming about?"
9464,Stefan, I was your escort
9465,Katherine, That was before you and Damon knew about my little secret
9466,Damon," Everyone will you please join me and raising your glasses to my good friend George Lockwood. George, thank you for so bravely defending the south"
9467,George," My honor Mr. Salvatore. After all, someone had to do it"
9468,Henry, Can we have a word Miss Katherine? 
9469,Katherine, Grab a glass Henry. It's a celebration
9470,Henry," Please, Miss Katherine"
9471,Henry, I looked about those attacks from the other night. It wasn't vampires
9472,Katherine," That's good news, Henry. That means there's nothing to worry about"
9473,Henry, I'm afraid you don't understand. Those folks were turned apart in ways I've never seen before
9474,Katherine, Then… it won't be long before the founders drop an investigation
9475,Henry, We'll leave town immediately. I'll tell the others
9476,Katherine," Relax, Henry. This town is our home and the vampires are my family. I will not let anything happen to us"
9477,Katherine," From the moment I met George, I knew he'd be a problem"
9478,Stefan, So you're saying that all the Lockwood's are werewolves
9479,Katherine, The werewolf gene runs in the Lockwood family. They're not all werewolves
9480,Stefan, How many of the werewolves are out there? I mean… is it just limited to the Lockwood's? 
9481,Katherine," No, there are others. Not many. They're practically instinct. They mainly exist now in books and really bad movies"
9482,Katherine, My turn to ask a question
9483,Katherine," Why did you keep this picture? Why not burn it? Tear it up? You want to know why I came back. Well I have a better question: Why did you? For Elena? No. You came back here to fall in love with me all over again, didn't you?"
9484,Stefan, What is it about you that make me still care?
9485,Stefan," Now, where were we? That's right; you were going to tell me why you came back to Mystic Falls, weren't you?"
9486,Katherine, You don't have to do this
9487,Stefan, Answer the question
9488,Katherine, I came back for you
9489,Stefan, We are gonna play about my rules now
9490,Stefan, Answer the question
9491,Katherine, You're going to torture me now?
9492,Stefan, I'll do whatever it takes to get you to tell me the truth
9493,Katherine, Later that night at the founder's ball…
9494,Stefan, I don't want to hear any more stories about the past
9495,Katherine," Yes you do, Stefan. That's exactly what you want to hear"
9496,George, She's all alone. This is mean I can finally have you all to myself?
9497,Katherine, Your father has done himself
9498,George," Knowing my father, he wants to throw a founder's party every year "
9499,Katherine, I must admit I'm rather surprised that you'd come looking for me
9500,George, Because you are the rope in the Salvatore's brother's w*r?
9501,Katherine," No, because I'm a vampire who could k*ll you in your sleep"
9502,George, I beg your pardon?
9503,Katherine," Relax, George. I know you know my secret"
9504,George, This conversation is over
9505,Katherine," And I know your secret too and I know that you are extra strong, only not as strong"
9506,George, How do you know who I am?
9507,Katherine, You think that I will settle into a town without knowing my enemies? 
9508,George, What do you want?
9509,Stefan, What did you want?
9510,Elena, Thanks for letting me invite Caroline. She could use a day of distraction
9511,Jenna," Well, she's not the plus that I'm worried about. Why is Damon coming?"
9512,Elena," Because Alaric is a pity taker. Come on Jenna, be nice"
9513,Jenna, I'll be nice when Damon learns to keep his pose of you
9514,Mason, Good news! I found the sh*t glasses!
9515,Elena, That would be my exit
9516,Jenna, You're here for 10 minutes and I'm already back into the bleachers of the pep rally
9517,Mason," Like old times, uh? Only I didn't swipe this bottle from my old men"
9518,Alaric," Oh, the expensive stuff! I like you already"
9519,Mason, Just happy to be invited
9520,Jenna," Thank rick, that was his idea"
9521,Mason, Really?
9522,Alaric," Yeah, you know, I thought it would be nice some of Jenna's high school friends. Dig up a little dirt"
9523,Mason, I've got dirt. I've got dirt
9524,Jenna, I have no secrets. Only dirty shame
9525,Alaric, To dirty shame
9526,Damon, Hey
9527,Jenna, Damon 
9528,Alaric, You were just going shots. Let me give you a sh*t glass buddy 
9529,Jenna, Here. Use mine
9530,Damon, She doesn't like me very much
9531,Mason, We haven't met. Mason Lockwood
9532,Damon, Oh sure. Damon Salvatore
9533,Mason, I know. I heard great things about you
9534,Damon, Really? That's weird ‘cause I'm a dick 
9535,Elena, Hey. Just checking in. Did you get my message about Jenna's barbecue? Call me when you can
9536,Caroline, Is that Stefan?
9537,Elena," Yeah, he hasn't called me back. I try to decide if I should be worried"
9538,Caroline, I'm sure he's fine
9539,Caroline, God! I cannot stop eating. Stefan says it's a great way to sublimit the cravings. It's horrible just fighting the urge for bl*od every minute of every day
9540,Elena, I know that Stefan really hates that part of himself
9541,Caroline, Yeah and he hates that you're a constant temptation 
9542,Elena, e said that?
9543,Caroline," The desire to rip out your jugular every time he's with you? Trust me, it's there. It's why I had to break up with Matt"
9544,Alaric," Hey! The food's ready, come get it."
9545,Caroline," Finally, I'm starving"
9546,Stefan," You know, we can stay here as long as you want. And when you'll start to desiccate, there's a tomb with your name on it"
9547,Katherine," I've been doing all the talking, it's your turn. Do you pretend to be human when you're with Elena? Is that the appeal?"
9548,Stefan," Actually, I'm not pretending to be anything when I'm with her. That's the whole point. I get to just be myself"
9549,Katherine, Does she know that you love me?
9550,Stefan, I don't
9551,Katherine," That's where you're wrong, Stefan. Don't you remember bringing me home that night? Your family had taken me in "
9552,Katherine," I had a really good time, Stefan"
9553,Stefan, How long do you plan on staying in Mystic Falls?
9554,Katherine, As long as I'm wanted. Your father has been very king to give me a shelter
9555,Stefan," How can he not? Losing your family in a fire, hopefully you made it to Atlanta"
9556,Katherine," So, I gather I'm wanted?"
9557,Stefan," Uh, very much so. I know… we've only known each other for a short while and I know I'm in competition for your affection but I've never met a woman quite like you. I look at and I see an angel. I touch your skin and my entire body is knits. I kiss you and I know that I'm falling in love"
9558,Stefan, I am in love with you
9559,Katherine," There's so much you don't know about me, Stefan"
9560,Stefan, More to learn in love
9561,Katherine, I must say good night 
9562,Stefan, I have upset you?
9563,Katherine," No, you haven't upset me, you've just surprised me"
9564,Katherine, What are you doing here?
9565,Damon, I told you I would come
9566,Katherine," Well, I'm tired, you should go"
9567,Damon, Did my little brother confession overwarm you?
9568,Katherine, You shouldn't ears drop 
9569,Damon, Is my love not enough?
9570,Katherine," I told you, I'm tired"
9571,Katherine," I wish to be alone tonight. Please, leave"
9572,Damon, Good night Katherine
9573,Katherine," Go ahead Stefan. Torture me, keep me captive, drain me of my bl*od until my body turns to dust. It'll never change the truth. I never compelled your love. It was real and so was mine"
9574,Jenna, Dress! Ballerina! 
9575,Caroline, Puppy! Puppy with a tutu! 
9576,Damon," No, no"
9577,Jenna, A dog! Hound-dog! 
9578,Mason," ""Dances with the wolves"" "
9579,Damon, Mason wins…again 
9580,Jenna, How is that a wolf?
9581,Damon, Jenna is getting tipsy 
9582,Elena, Will you stop playing her with alcohol? 
9583,Damon, I want her to like me
9584,Elena, How is operation Lockwood?
9585,Damon, He's my new BFF 
9586,Jenna, There you are. Isn't this fun?
9587,Damon," Yes, thank you so much for inviting me"
9588,Jenna, Did I have a choice? 
9589,Damon, I know what you must think about me
9590,Jenna," No, you don't. You've never dated you; I have dated many you's"
9591,Damon, I'm in working progress
9592,Damon, These are fancy
9593,Jenna, Thanks. My mother silver set
9594,Katherine, Hearing the truth after a century and a half of denial must be overwhelming 
9595,Stefan," It wasn't real, I remember you compelling me"
9596,Katherine, Only after I showed you who I really was. You were so scared of me; I had to take away your fear
9597,Stefan," Well, whatever feelings I had back then, they all turned to hate"
9598,Katherine," Love, hate, such a fine line. I can wait. Anyway, George Lockwood was causing all sorts of trouble. He used the vampires to cover up his own tracks. He told the founding families about us. But he was willing to struck a deal"
9599,Stefan, What kind of a deal?
9600,Katherine, A deal to rid the town of vampires
9601,George, I just spoke to Giuseppe Salvatore. The round up happens tonight
9602,Katherine, Good. Insists so they do a body count before the church set up braze
9603,George, I will
9604,Katherine, 27 vampires 
9605,George," Once the flames create chaos, crawl to the exit under the quire low. I'll be there to set you free"
9606,Katherine, Make sure you're not followed. I need everyone to believe I perished in that fire
9607,Stefan, You knew that they were gonna burn the vampires in the church?
9608,Katherine, I practically lit the match 
9609,Stefan," They were your friends, they were your family and you just sold them out."
9610,Katherine, Without blinking 
9611,Damon," Mason, why don't you start this off?"
9612,Mason, Sure
9613,Mason," I apologize, I'm an animal"
9614,Alaric," So Mason, you and Jenna never dated?"
9615,Mason, She was always lost in Logan Fell land 
9616,Jenna, My first mistake. Mason was a catch; girls lined up
9617,Damon, Really? I always pegged you for a lone wolf
9618,Mason, I'm sure I wasn't half the lady k*ll you were. How about a toast? To new friends
9619,Elena, Would I be the worst friend in the world if i abandon you and went to Stefan's?
9620,Caroline, You want to leave?
9621,Elena, It's just that he hasn't calling back to me and I'm starting to have this bad feeling
9622,Caroline," I don't think that's a good idea, Elena"
9623,Elena, Damon's got it under control here
9624,Caroline," Take it from me, there's nothing worse than a clingy girlfriend"
9625,Elena," I'm not being clingy, I'm just concerned. You understand, right?"
9626,Caroline, How about I drive you?
9627,Elena," Yeah, okay, that'll be great, thanks"
9628,Stefan, What had George get in return? For giving you your freedom
9629,Katherine, Something he wanted desperately
9630,Stefan," So you sent 26 of your friends to their death, just to fake your own? No, you were running from something. What was it?"
9631,Katherine," Everyone has a past, Stefan. Mine needed to stay far far away but thanks to you my plan nearly failed it even began. Once George told me that the round up was imminent, i made sure I could see you one last time but your father used your love for me against me, he poisoned your bl*od. And Damon being Damon, nearly ruined everything "
9632,Stefan," We came for you, we tried to save you. "
9633,Katherine, I didn't want to be saved
9634,Stefan, So then Damon and I died for nothing! For nothing!
9635,Katherine," No, you died for love"
9636,Mason," Jenna just brought ""Guitar Hero"""
9637,Damon," Well, I just happen to like ""Guitar Hero"". So you my friend, are barking up the wrong treat "
9638,Mason," Okay. Enough with the implies, you win, you're hilarious"
9639,Damon, Thank you
9640,Mason," Come on, men. You don't think I know what this barbecue is about?"
9641,Damon, How did you know about me? Your brother was completely clues 
9642,Mason," It doesn't matter; I'm not your enemy, Damon"
9643,Damon, You tried to k*ll my brother
9644,Mason, That was a mistake
9645,Damon, Really?
9646,Mason, I was confused; I couldn't chain myself up in time. I have no control once I shift
9647,Damon," What, no obedience school?"
9648,Mason, I'm serious. Let's not spark some edge old fuel that doesn't imply us
9649,Damon, You expect me to believe that you are in Mystic Falls planting peace trees?
9650,Mason," I lost my brother, my nephew lost his father. I'm here for my family. Let's be above this"
9651,Elena," Thank for this, I appreciate it"
9652,Caroline," Here we come, to the rescue"
9653,Elena, Why are you being so snippy? 
9654,Caroline, That's my own drama. I'm sure you two will b*at the odds. Not that there is any study to pull outs from. What is the ratio success vampire-human coupling? I'm guessing no
9655,Elena, Okay Caroline
9656,Caroline, Sorry
9657,Mason, No one to take some more drinks at the grill? It's like I am with a bunch of adults here
9658,Jenna," I prefer the term ""Role model"""
9659,Mason," Okay. Well, thanks for having me, it was awesome. Alaric, I catch you at the game next week?"
9660,Alaric," Yeah, I look forward to it"
9661,Damon," You know, I should probably head out too"
9662,Damon," Jenna, you are a wonderful hostess "
9663,Jenna, And you are a terrible artist
9664,Damon, is that the only thing that makes me terrible?
9665,Jenna, I'm still deciding
9666,Damon," Good enough for me. Alaric, let's not catch that game next week"
9667,Elena, Are you sure the tow's coming? We've been waiting forever
9668,Caroline," I know, it's weird. They said they'd be here by now"
9669,Elena, Yeah. I'm just gonna call Jenna
9670,Caroline, No! Let me call the tow people again. I gonna use my aggressive voice
9671,Elena, Can we just walk from here?
9672,Caroline, I can't just leave my car
9673,Elena, We'll come back for it
9674,Caroline," Just give me a minute, Elena"
9675,Elena," Caroline, what part ""I'm worried about Stefan"" didn't think in?"
9676,Caroline, What's the rush? Why are you hurrying to get to a relationship that will never work?
9677,Elena," Okay, look. I know that you're upset over Matt but would you stop projecting it onto me and Stefan please?"
9678,Caroline," I'm not projecting anything! You're human, he's a vampire. You're gonna be 70 and in diapers and he's still gonna be smoking hot and you will never have his children, Elena! And you are too maternal to not have children!"
9679,Elena, Where is this coming from?
9680,Caroline, I'm just trying to be your friend
9681,Elena," Okay, do me a favor and stop trying"
9682,Elena," Here's the tow, I'm gonna walk"
9683,Caroline," No, Elena, don't!"
9684,Elena," Caroline, you're hurting me"
9685,Caroline, Don't leave me alone
9686,Elena, What's wrong with you?
9687,Tow guy," Hey there, someone called about a flat tire?"
9688,Elena (looking at Caroline), She did
9689,Mason, Damon? What? More jokes?
9690,Damon," No, those got old"
9691,Mason," You know, I think it was werewolves who started this whole silver myth. Probably for moves like this"
9692,Damon, Dully noted
9693,Mason, I was really looking forward the last call. Now you made an enemy 
9694,Stefan, Are you gonna tell me why you came back here or you're just playing another game?
9695,Katherine, Have you not heard a word that I've said? I've answered that question 5 times over now
9696,Stefan," Oh good, make it six"
9697,Katherine," I want what I want, Stefan and I don't care what I have to do to get it. My list of v*ctim is a long one and I have no problem adding one more name to that list "
9698,Stefan," Come on Katherine. If you wanted Elena dead, you would have done it by now"
9699,Katherine," Still can. If i have to, I will snap her neck like a twig and you know it"
9700,Katherine," I guess you don't hate me as much I you thought you did. I don't want you seeing Elena anymore. If you don't remove far from your life, I will k*ll everyone that she loves while she watches and then I will k*ll her while you watch"
9701,Stefan, Don't you ever think for one moment that I will not k*ll you
9702,Katherine," I have been sipping vervein every single day for the last 145 years. You got me by surprise once, I wasn't gonna let that happen again. It doesn't hurt me, Stefan"
9703,Stefan, What? Why?
9704,Katherine," I told you, I missed you Stefan. I just wanted to spend some time with you"
9705,Katherine, You must be Elena
9706,Elena, How is this possible? How do we look exactly alike?
9707,Katherine, You're asking the wrong questions
9708,Stefan, Elena?!
9709,Stefan, Are you okay?
9710,Elena, Not really. Are you okay?
9711,Stefan, Not really
9712,Caroline, Katherine
9713,Katherine, Cared to share how you couldn't fallow through one simple task?
9714,Caroline, I tried okay? But I couldn't exactly kidnap my best friend
9715,Katherine, Occupy her. That's all I asked 
9716,Caroline, I told her that her relationship was doomed and all that mortality stuff. I think…I really think that I got to her
9717,Katherine, I hope so because let's not forget. I already k*ll you once; I can easily do it again
9718,Tyler, How was that barbecue?
9719,Mason, Not great. Are you still pissed? 
9720,Tyler, Are you still keeping secrets?
9721,Mason, Yeah
9722,Tyler," Then I'm still pissed. Hey, you know I was thinking about that stone you were looking for. I know a couple places where it could be"
9723,Mason, Do you think this is a joke? If you know where it is then tell me
9724,Tyler, Tell me all the curse's trigger
9725,Mason," If I tell you, you won't be able to think about anything else. I don't want that for you"
9726,Tyler, I think I can handle knowing
9727,Mason," You think that you can handle it, tough guy? You have no idea"
9728,Tyler, You want your stupid rock or not?! 
9729,Mason, Tell me where it is!
9730,Tyler, Tell me what triggers the curse!
9731,Mason, You have to k*ll somebody! Human bl*od! You take another person's life away from them and then the curse is yours forever! Can you handle that?
9732,Caroline, Elena
9733,Elena, Hey
9734,Caroline, Oh my god. I am so sorry about earlier today. I don't know what came over me
9735,Elena," It okay, Caroline. Everything that you were saying was right. It's just hard for me to hear, you know?"
9736,Caroline, So… you're not mad at me?
9737,Elena, You were just being good friend…in your own way
9738,Caroline," My own hand case, horrible way. Elena, I really am sorry"
9739,Stefan, I'm starving
9740,Elena," Well, Spending the day with your jealous ex will do that to you"
9741,Stefan," Listen, I know you're upset but we have to take her seriously. Today, was all about the links she should go to"
9742,Elena," If she was going to hurt me, she would have. I was standing right in front of her"
9743,Stefan," Elena, you cut off her guard. It doesn't mean that you're safe"
9744,Elena, I'm not afraid of her
9745,Stefan," Well, you should be"
9746,Elena," If Katherine had her way, we'll be breaking up right now"
9747,Stefan," If today taught me anything, is that Katherine is used to getting her way"
9748,Elena, You're not actually saying that we should what she says?
9749,Stefan," Listen, she's sadistic, okay? She threatened you, she threatened everyone"
9750,Elena," Yeah, I know, I get it. She's dangerous. But every day that we are together, it's dangerous. Why are you giving her so much power over our relationship?"
9751,Stefan, This is the reality of our situation
9752,Elena, The reality sucks
9753,Elena, This is what she wants. She wants us to fight. She wants to get between us
9754,Stefan," She already has, Elena"
9755,Katherine, Bad day?
9756,Damon, Bad century. I heard you are on the loose 
9757,Katherine, What's the matter? Jealous I spent the day with Stefan?
9758,Damon," I don't do jealous. Not with you, not anymore"
9759,Katherine, Then why so pouty? 
9760,Damon," I tried to k*ll a werewolf, I failed. Now I feel like I'm not living up to my best self "
9761,Katherine," Well, werewolves aren't easy prey"
9762,Damon, What do you know about werewolves?
9763,Katherine," Why don't you ask your brother? Don't try to be the hero, Damon. You'll end up dead"
9764,Damon," Been there, done that. Unless this time it'll worth it"
9765,Stefan, Are you okay?
9766,Elena, I hated that fight
9767,Stefan, I know me too. It felt too real
9768,Elena, Did you see Caroline?
9769,Stefan, Yeah
9770,Elena, We were right. Katherine got to her. She was hanging on to every single word
9771,Stefan, It won't be long before Katherine gets a play by play 
9772,Elena, I wish she was wrong but I know Caroline too well. It was so obvious that something was up today
9773,Stefan, You're not wrong. It's pure Katherine. She's always finding somebody to do her dirty work
9774,Elena, I think Damon was listening to us fight too. Are you gonna tell him that it wasn't real?
9775,Stefan, The only way Katherine is gonna believe it is if everybody believes it. That's the best way to make her think she's getting what she wants
9776,Elena, All this…just to get you back
9777,Stefan," It's not why she's here, okay? No matter what she says, I know her. Katherine doesn't care about anybody but herself, she never has. She's incapable of love. She's here for another reason"
9778,Katherine, George
9779,George, Your car is just waiting
9780,Katherine," All done, George. Thank you"
9781,George, Now it's your part of the deal
9782,Katherine," If anyone learns of my escape, I will find you and I will k*ll you. Don't think that I won't"
9783,George," We should take each other secrets to the grave. Now, you must hurry"
9784,Katherine," I love you, Stefan. We will be together again, I promise"
9785,Mason, Alright Carlos. It's all for me
9786,Jimmy, Mason!
9787,Mason, Hey Jimmy. Easy. Let's get you home
9788,Jimmy, Screw you!
9789,Jimmy, I know about you and Marla
9790,Mason, What are you talking about? You've had too much to drink
9791,Mason," Dude! What's up?! It's me, Mason! I'm not messing with Marla. You know that!"
9792,Mason, You don't want to do this buddy 
9793,Jimmy, I'll k*ll you!
9794,Mason, Jimmy?
9795,Tyler," Wait, the guy died? You k*ll him?"
9796,Mason, He kept coming at me. He got in his head that I was sleeping with his girlfriend
9797,Tyler, Were you?
9798,Mason," No. No. I wouldn't do that, he was my friend. He was drunk and attacked me. It was self-defense"
9799,Tyler, And it triggered the curse
9800,Mason," On every full moon, I lose control. If I don't sedate myself and chain myself, I'll k*ll anything in my path. You have to be careful. All it takes is an accident, a car wreck. Any death at your hands and you'll have a lifetime of this. You don't want it Tyler, trust me "
9801,Mason, Alright. Where is the moonstone? A deal is a deal. I answered your questions
9802,Tyler," Um, yeah, I'm not sure but I'm guessing it's in here. "
9803,Tyler," My dad, he was very cookie about his hiding spots but I figured most of them out over the years "
9804,Tyler, It's all yours 
9805,Tyler, Are you gonna tell me what's so important about this rock or what?
9806,Mason," I told you, it's just something I want. Sentimental value "
9807,Tyler, I'm not really buying that. Why do you really want it?
9808,Mason, do you know where it is or not?
9809,Tyler," No, I figured it would be in here, man"
9810,Jeremy, I can't believe Tyler Lockwood is a werewolf
9811,Elena, We're not sure about that yet. Anything we know for sure is that Mason Lockwood is
9812,Jeremy, It should be enough easy for us to figure it out
9813,Elena, There is no us. I said that I wouldn't keep things from you anymore. That doesn't mean that I want you involved in it
9814,Jeremy," By definition of being in this family, I'm involved"
9815,Elena," This is dangerous, Jeremy. You have to stay out of it, okay?"
9816,Jeremy, Alright. Just saying
9817,Stefan," Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you"
9818,Elena, Hi
9819,Stefan, Hey
9820,Stefan, Are you ready for today
9821,Elena," No. I hate fighting with you, even if it's fake"
9822,Stefan," I know but if Katherine thinks we were fighting, then she will think that she's winning and it keeps her from following her threats"
9823,Elena," Yeah. Well, it doesn't make it any easier. Neither just knowing that Caroline will be there, reporting everything back to her"
9824,Stefan," Hey, everything's gonna be okay. Yes we have to keep up this ruse for a little while but the best way to keep Katherine from hurting anybody, from hurting you"
9825,Elena," Just promise me that she won't get her way with us. We can fake a fight, we can pretend that her threats are tearing us apart but none of it it's real, okay?"
9826,Stefan," Okay, how about this? Today, when we're fighting, if I say ""I can't do this anymore, Elena"", what I really mean is that I love you"
9827,Elena," And when I say ""Fine Stefan, whatever"" well that means I love you too"
9828,Stefan, Deal
9829,Caroline, Are you off today?
9830,Liz, The historical society volunteer pic-nick is today. You're the one who signed me up
9831,Caroline, I know. I just assumed you'd bale
9832,Liz, No. I'm gonna spend the whole day with my daughter
9833,Caroline, You're gonna pretend to be a mother?
9834,Liz," I'll bring my g*n if it gets rough. Come on, give me one day. I've been buried in work mode, I've barely seen you"
9835,Caroline," Well be warned, I'm in a mood "
9836,Liz, Goody for me. What was Elena doing here so late last night?
9837,Caroline, Elena wasn't… yes um… Elena was here. She just needed to talk. Her and Stefan are going trough a rough patch 
9838,Liz, Is everything okay with you?
9839,Caroline, I'm fine
9840,Liz, It's just lately you seem different
9841,Caroline," I'm not different, I'm fine"
9842,Liz, I know you think I don't notice these things but I do. What's going on with you?
9843,Caroline," You know there's pretending to be a mother and there's reality. Let's not push our luck, okay?"
9844,Carol," This all part of the historical society, continuing efforts to give that to the community. Thanks to the generous donation of the Fell family. We are now standing on the sight of our newest public park. Thank you to everyone who has shown up today to land a helping hand. Thanks."
9845,Mason, Stefan right? The other Salvatore
9846,Stefan, The nice one. The one offering an apology
9847,Mason, Not interested
9848,Stefan," Look, my brother acted impulsively"
9849,Mason, You think?
9850,Stefan," If you and Damon keep at each other throats, somebody innocent is going to get hurt and I don't want that. You have family here so I can imagine you don't want that either. So what do you say we just quit the whole alpha male fighting things and call a truce? "
9851,Mason, I made that same offer to your brother. He turned it down with a kn*fe 
9852,Stefan, He made a mistake. I'm here to make sure neither of you make another one
9853,Mason, Tell your brother to watch his back
9854,Stefan," Well, I'm guessing that you can only worry about that during a full moon. Otherwise you're not as strong, am I right? Or you would have k*ll Damon by now. It's one of you. There's two of us. I think you're the only one that needs to watch his back"
9855,Mason, If he comes with me…
9856,Stefan, He won't
9857,Damon, What are you doing?
9858,Stefan, Negotiating peace on your behalf
9859,Damon, I don't want peace
9860,Stefan, Consider it opposite day
9861,Damon," Stefan, please tell me you don't seriously think a hand shake just solve our problem"
9862,Stefan," No actually I think that the first chance Mason Lockwood gets, he's gonna drive a stake through your heart and then through mine because you took upon yourself to try to k*ll him. So thank you, because we don't have enough problems"
9863,Sarah, When did Jeremy Gilbert get so cute?
9864,Aimee," Oh no, stay away, that guy is damages goods "
9865,Jeremy," Hey man, how have you been?"
9866,Tyler, Since when?
9867,Jeremy," I don't know, I haven't seen you much since your father funeral. I just figured maybe you'd want…"
9868,Tyler," I'm fine, Gilbert"
9869,Jeremy, Yeah okay
9870,Tyler," Wait, hold up. I'm sorry. Bad day, bad month. Listen, you were cool that day, at the wake. Thanks for that. I felt like in a freak show"
9871,Jeremy," Yeah, I know the feeling well. What are you doing here?"
9872,Tyler, Distracting myself
9873,Aimee," Hey, thanks for the text. We're two"
9874,Tyler," My place. My mom is gone all day. Empty house, full bar…"
9875,Aimee, Margaritas?
9876,Tyler, Sure
9877,Tyler, You're in?
9878,Jeremy," Yeah. Yeah, I'm in"
9879,Aimee, Let's do it
9880,Liz, Oh thanks Mason
9881,Mason," Hey Sheriff, you've got a second?"
9882,Liz, I'm out of uniform. Let's go with Liz
9883,Mason, Alright Liz. I was hoping to talk to you about the council 
9884,Liz, I don't know what you're talking about
9885,Mason, I know you and the others founding families have a secret council
9886,Liz, If that were true then you'd know it's a secret and isn't discuss with non-council members
9887,Mason," I know I rejected all that but it's only because I wanted a life outside this town, not because I was a non-believer. Look, I now vampires exist and you have two of them living right under your nose"
9888,Liz, Really?
9889,Mason, Yeah
9890,Liz, Who would they be?
9891,Mason, Damon and Stefan Salvatore
9892,Liz, That's impossible. I know Damon Salvatore. Do you know what he's done for this town?
9893,Mason, I know it's a lot to digest 
9894,Liz, No. I watched him k*ll vampires. He's an ally; he's part of the council
9895,Mason, Think about it. When did the vampires attack begin? When Damon and Stefan Salvatore moved to town?
9896,Liz," They walk in the sun, Mason"
9897,Mason," They've evolved. It's not 1864. They figured it out, Liz"
9898,Liz, No. Damon Salvatore is my friend
9899,Mason, What if I can prove it to you?
9900,Caroline," So suddenly, she's on the running for mother of the year just when I'm trying to avoid her the most. I'm babbling, you don't want to hear all this"
9901,Elena," No, sorry. Then what happened? "
9902,Caroline," Well, I was a bitch but it's part of the process. So, how are things between you and Stefan? Anything?"
9903,Elena," No, not since the fight. He's been pushing me away because he thinks that Katherine might get jealous enough to hurt me. I just don't know how to change his mind"
9904,Caroline, You said that Katherine's dangerous. Maybe he's got a point
9905,Elena," Yeah, I know that she's dangerous and I know that he's just trying to protect me but it feels like giving up and I just…"
9906,Caroline, Just what?
9907,Elena, I just thought we were stronger than that
9908,Damon," Hey, I saw you with Mason earlier. What was that about?"
9909,Liz, I just asked him to help with the cleanup in the woods
9910,Damon," That's why I'm here for, put me to work. Should I go help him?"
9911,Liz," Oh no. You know, he's… I'm sure he's fine"
9912,Damon," Are you okay, Liz? You seem really upset"
9913,Liz, It's Caroline. We had a moment
9914,Damon, Is there anything I can do?
9915,Liz," No, Damon. Thank you. It's just the horrible parental k*ll paying off and space"
9916,Caroline," Oh, oh. Lurking looks are being exchanged"
9917,Elena, I'm gonna go talk to him
9918,Caroline," No, Elena. I think it's a bad idea"
9919,Damon, What's her problem?
9920,Caroline, Don't worry about it
9921,Damon, Why are you being such a bitch to your mom?
9922,Caroline, Don't worry about it
9923,Elena, Do you still care about Katherine?
9924,Stefan, Don't be like this. Please don't turn this into something that it's not
9925,Elena, So this is not for discussion. That's what you're saying?
9926,Stefan," No, I'm saying that is enough for discussion right now because we have ears on us"
9927,Elena," Okay, when?"
9928,Stefan, I don't know
9929,Elena, I saw her Stefan. It's like we are the same person. How could you hate her and be in love with me?
9930,Stefan, You're reaching. I'm not… I'm not Damon
9931,Elena, How about we don't bring Damon into this right now?
9932,Stefan," You know, I can't… I can't do this anymore, Elena"
9933,Elena," Fine, Stefan. Whatever "
9934,Damon, Relationships are about communication 
9935,Aimee, Where is mine? 
9936,Aimee, Thanks for having us over. I think Sarah got a thing for Jeremy
9937,Tyler," Well, good for Sarah"
9938,Aimee," Look, I'm really embarrassed for slating in up that day at the swimming hole. I'm really not like that, I promise you"
9939,Tyler, You don't need to apologize 
9940,Aimee, Friends?
9941,Tyler," Yeah, sure"
9942,Sarah, Can I see?
9943,Jeremy," No, no. No way"
9944,Aimee, I want to see
9945,Tyler," Yeah, let's see. What's Van Gogh got going on?"
9946,Jeremy," Okay, yeah. Check it out"
9947,Sarah, Scary demon wolf thing
9948,Tyler, What's this about?
9949,Jeremy," just some scratches. You still draw, Tyler?"
9950,Tyler," A little but not much. You know, I've got something I'm actually working on. Come on, I'll show you"
9951,Jeremy," Yeah. Okay, sure"
9952,Tyler, It's on the desk
9953,Jeremy, I can't see anything
9954,Tyler, What were those pictures about?
9955,Jeremy, I can't breath
9956,Tyler, Answer to me! Why? Why wolf pictures?
9957,Jeremy, Because… because I know
9958,Tyler, You know what? You know what Jeremy?!
9959,Jeremy, I know what you are
9960,Damon," Hello, Mason. Working hard?"
9961,Mason, Doing my part
9962,Damon, I heard you talked to Stefan
9963,Mason, Nice guy
9964,Damon," Yeah, a lot nicer than me"
9965,Mason, Niceness is overrated
9966,Damon, That's what I think
9967,Mason," You have a good day, Damon"
9968,Stefan, Please tell me that you were just bounding 
9969,Damon, So what's up this faux drama in your relationship?
9970,Stefan, What are you talking about?
9971,Damon," Oh come on, Stefan. You and Elena don't fight, especially not over me"
9972,Stefan," Drop it, Damon"
9973,Damon, With pleasure
9974,Little Girl, Would you like some lemonade?
9975,Damon, Thank you sweetie 
9976,Stefan, What's wrong with you?
9977,Damon, Vervein. Vervein
9978,Caroline, Are you okay?
9979,Elena, No
9980,Caroline," You know, maybe it's for the best"
9981,Elena," It's not for the best, Caroline. None of this is for the best. I'm sorry, okay? I… I don't mean to take it out on you. You're just being a good friend "
9982,Caroline, No. I'm not. I'm not being a good friend at all
9983,Caroline, Is she leaving? Where is my mom going?
9984,Liz," Look, I can't talk here. Just get Jesse and meet me down hallow at the entrance. And bring a… yes we need it"
9985,Caroline, What's wrong?
9986,Liz, Nothing. I just have something…
9987,Caroline, You mean work? You've surprised me. You last longer than 5 minutes 
9988,Liz, It's important
9989,Caroline, It always is
9990,Liz, I'm sorry
9991,Elena, What's going on?
9992,Caroline, I don't know. Something's up
9993,Damon, I'm gonna k*ll him
9994,Stefan, Listen to me! Sit! Sit!
9995,Damon," I'm not listening anymore of you ""get peace a chance"" crap. He's dead!"
9996,Damon, Okay. I don't like it but he's making threats. He could expose us. We need to put him down
9997,Damon, Alright. Let's do it
9998,Damon, Woods. Trash duty. Come on 
9999,Elena, Where are you going? What's going on?
10000,Caroline, I need to be able to hear better
10001,Elena, Hear what?
10002,Caroline," Something's wrong, Elena"
10003,Damon," Don't look so surprised. You knew this was inevitable. Go ahead, run. I give you a head start"
10004,Caroline, Oh god
10005,Elena, What is it?
10006,Caroline, Stefan and Damon
10007,Elena, What?
10008,Liz," Thank you, Mason"
10009,Tyler, How do you know about all this?
10010,Jeremy, My uncle John left this old diary lying around. It was written by a crazy Gilbert ancestor who wrote about this curse that run in your family
10011,Tyler, A curse about what?
10012,Jeremy," Werewolves. It's crazy right? But then, Matt was attacked by a wolf under a full moon and your uncle has just gotten back to town. It was too weird. Is it true?"
10013,Tyler, About my uncle? Yeah
10014,Jeremy, Bu you… you're not…
10015,Tyler," Aw wolf? I'm sorry, a werewolf? No. I mean, not yet. Just saying that out loud, i sound insane"
10016,Jeremy," I don't think so but then again, I always did believe in the crazy stuff "
10017,Tyler," According to my uncle, you have to trigger the curse. Somebody has to die on your hands, like a m*rder or an accident. I basically have to cause death and then boom: next full moon I'm hulling on all fours"
10018,Jeremy, Is that why he came back? To tell you all this?
10019,Tyler," Yeah, right. He had to tell me. I caught him. He's not here for me"
10020,Tyler, He's here for this
10021,Mason, It's down the stairs to the left
10022,Liz, Careful. The wooden b*ll*ts and vervein won't keep them down for long. What is this place?
10023,Mason, Old slave quarters from the original Lockwood house
10024,Liz," Thank you, Mason. I appreciate all you've done. We got it from here "
10025,Mason, You're gonna k*ll them right?
10026,Liz," Yes. That's why you should go. Here it's the council, not the law. You can't be a party to this. It's for your own protection"
10027,Mason," Liz, I don't care about…"
10028,Liz, I do and I'm not asking. Goodbye Mason
10029,Mason, Don't take any chances
10030,Elena, What is it?
10031,Caroline, They've been here
10032,Elena, What?
10033,Mason, What are you two doing out here?
10034,Elena, Have you seen Stefan?
10035,Mason," Yeah Elena, I've seen him. Seen Damon too"
10036,Elena, Where are they?
10037,Mason, You don't need me for that. I let your friend here sniff them out
10038,Mason, Does your mother know what you are? I'll happy to tell her
10039,Mason, Don't be stupid! Necks snap easy around here
10040,Caroline, I can take you
10041,Mason, Wanna bet?
10042,Caroline, Yeah. I do
10043,Caroline, I told you
10044,Caroline, Come on
10045,Liz," This is how it's gonna work. Answer me and you don't get sh*t, understand? How many of you are they? "
10046,Damon," Please, please"
10047,Liz, How did you fool us? How do you walk in the sun?
10048,Liz, I will drag this out painfully 
10049,Damon, But you're my friend
10050,Liz, Our friendship was a lie. Answer me and I'll k*ll you fast
10051,Elena, What is that?
10052,Elena," Caroline. Caroline, what is it?"
10053,Caroline, My mom. She's k*ll them
10054,Elena, What?! We have to stop her!
10055,Caroline," No, I can't. Elena, she's gonna find out about me"
10056,Liz," Let's do this. Each with a stake in the heart, then burn them both"
10057,Liz, Elena! What are you doing?
10058,Elena, You can't k*ll them. I'm not gonna let you
10059,Deputy, What was that?
10060,Liz, Who else is with you?
10061,Caroline, Hi mom
10062,Damon, You need to drink some deputy bl*od
10063,Stefan, No. I'm gonna be fine. It's gonna take a little bit longer
10064,Caroline, Damon's right you know. If it's ever time to break your diet…
10065,Elena," He said he didn't want it, okay?"
10066,Damon, This is the most unfortunate situation. Two deputies dead and you
10067,Damon, What am i gonna do with you?
10068,Caroline," You won't tell anyone, will you? Mom? Mom? Please. Look, I know that we don't get along and that you hate me but I'm your daughter and you'll do this for me, right? Mom, please. He will k*ll you"
10069,Liz, Then k*ll me
10070,Caroline, No!
10071,Liz, I can't take this. k*ll me now
10072,Damon, But you're gonna dry out so painfully
10073,Caroline," No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
10074,Stefan," Damon, don't!"
10075,Elena," Damon, please!"
10076,Damon, Relax guys. No one is k*ll anybody
10077,Damon, You're my friend
10078,Damon, We have to clean this up
10079,Jeremy, What is it?
10080,Tyler, It's a moonstone. I looked it up online. It's a natural rock but there supposed to have all sorts of supernatural legends attached to them
10081,Jeremy, Why didn't you give it to him?
10082,Tyler, Because he wants it. I'm a dick that way. It's important to him for some reason but I don't trust the guy so I'm not just gonna hand it to him
10083,Sarah, Found you!
10084,Aimee," Hey, you guys are missing all the drinking "
10085,Sarah," Oh, I'm sorry. Were you two having a moment?"
10086,Tyler," No, we're good"
10087,Sarah," Hey, hey, what is that?"
10088,Aimee, Pretty
10089,Tyler," Okay, let's not play with the rock"
10090,Aimee," Well, come and get it"
10091,Tyler," Look, I'll play along for a little bit but seriously, give it back"
10092,Sarah, Look in here
10093,Sarah," Snooze, you lose "
10094,Tyler, You're lucky. You're cute when you're drunk
10095,Sarah, I want Jeremy to come get it
10096,Tyler, Give me a break
10097,Aimee," Sarah, don't be a bad drunk"
10098,Sarah," Jeremy, come upstairs with me. See how a bad drunk I can be"
10099,Jeremy," I'm good, thanks"
10100,Jeremy, Sarah! 
10101,Aimee," Sarah, oh my god!"
10102,Tyler, She fell!
10103,Aimee, She's not moving. Oh my god.
10104,Sarah, I fooled you
10105,Aimee, Oh my god
10106,Sarah, You pushed me on the stairs! 
10107,Jeremy," Look, he didn't mean it okay?"
10108,Caroline," Hey, sorry that took forever. I just didn't know how long my mom was gonna be here"
10109,Elena, Damon says it'll take 3 days' tops for the vervein to leave her system. Maybe even sooner
10110,Caroline, Hey! You had some bunny in you?
10111,Stefan," Yeah, I'm feeling much better, thank you"
10112,Liz," A stomach bone. Yeah, it came on fast. I'll definitely be out tomorrow"
10113,Liz, Or longer. I'll text you. Yeah. Good night
10114,Damon," Thank you. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's secure. I brought a good bed camp and once the vervein is worked out of your system, I will compel you, you will forget everything and you will be a free woman"
10115,Liz, Can you keep Caroline far away from me please? I don't want to see her
10116,Damon," She's your daughter, Liz"
10117,Liz, Not anymore. My daughter's gone
10118,Damon, You have no idea how wrong you are about that
10119,Elena," Stefan, I think that we should… what are you doing?"
10120,Stefan, Katherine took a little every day to immunize herself. I could do the same with bl*od. I could learn to control myself on it
10121,Elena," but you can't, Stefan. You don't have to"
10122,Stefan," I almost died tonight, Elena. Because I was too weak"
10123,Elena, But the last time that you drink human bl*od…
10124,Stefan," I told you I'll find a way to stop Katherine, didn't i? Well this is it, this is the only way because she's stronger than me. And unless I change it, I can't protect you"
10125,Elena, Can we talk about this later? 
10126,Stefan, He can hear us wherever we are because he drinks this. This is the only thing that can help me!
10127,Elena, Are you serious? Are you pretending to fight? Because I can't tell if…
10128,Stefan," No, this is real. No more pretend"
10129,Elena, You want me to take you home?
10130,Caroline, I can't go home
10131,Elena, Why not?
10132,Caroline, Because I'm scared
10133,Elena," Why are you scared? Caroline, you can talk to me"
10134,Caroline, Katherine's gonna be there and she's gonna want me to tell her everything that happened today. She told me I had to spy on you and report back to her
10135,Elena," I know and I've been so mad at you. But then, I tried to put myself in your position so that I could understand why you would do this to me and to Stefan because he's been such a friend to you. Who did she threaten? "
10136,Caroline," Matt, she threatened Matt and I'm so scared of her Elena! I am so scared of her"
10137,Elena," And you should be. Caroline, we all should be"
10138,Caroline, Why is she doing this? What does she want?
10139,Elena, That's the million dollar question 
10140,Mason," Hey Sheriff, its Mason Lockwood. I just want to make sure everything wet okay today. I didn't see you later and… give me a call will you?"
10141,Mason, Hey
10142,Tyler, I almost k*ll a girl today
10143,Mason, What?
10144,Tyler," It was an accident. I was being stupid. She's okay though but here I was and just for a moment, for a split second, I hope she'll die. Look, whatever this is inside me, I don't want any part of it. I don't ever want to feel that way again, I won't, and I can't"
10145,Mason, I know
10146,Mason, Thank you
10147,Tyler, Yeah
10148,Elena, Caroline is sleeping on the couch
10149,Damon, I heard and you?
10150,Elena," I'm going home. What you did for Caroline's mom, that's the Damon who was my friend"
10151,Damon," Hey, Stefan didn't drink the people bl*od if you're curious but he needs to and deep down you know that"
10152,Stefan, You can come in
10153,Elena, Do you really think that you can control it?
10154,Stefan, I don't know but if I don't try…
10155,Elena, So a little bit every day? 
10156,Stefan," Yeah, just of a few drops of bl*od in my system. That gets worth trying"
10157,Elena, So do I but I don't want you to do it alone
10158,Stefan, What are you doing?
10159,Elena," It's you and me, Stefan. Always"
10160,Katherine, I've been waiting
10161,Katherine, Mason? What happened?
10162,Mason, Jimmy attacked me
10163,Katherine, What? Why?
10164,Mason, He said that I hit on Marla
10165,Katherine, Why would he think that?
10166,Mason, He's dead. I k*ll him
10167,Katherine, Everything's gonna be okay
10168,Katherine, What was that stunt today that you pulled with Damon and Stefan Salvatore?
10169,Mason, I thought you would be happy about that
10170,Katherine, I told you to stay away from them
10171,Mason, Why do you even care?
10172,Katherine, I don't want you to get distracted. I need you to find the moonstone
10173,Katherine, You got it?
10174,Mason, I got it
10175,Stefan, You're staring
10176,Elena, I'm gazing
10177,Stefan, It's creepy
10178,Elena, It's romantic 
10179,Elena," Oh, this is bad of us"
10180,Stefan, Yes it is
10181,Elena, If Katherine finds out…
10182,Katherine," Shut, Miss Flowers will think I'm a floozy if I have a man in here"
10183,Mason, Why are you staying here?
10184,Katherine," Because I like this little bed and breakfast, don't you?"
10185,Mason, I love it
10186,Elena," Okay, I need be in the shower "
10187,Stefan," Love it, let' go!"
10188,Elena," No, just me. I'm late. I'm decorating at the Lockwood charity thing"
10189,Stefan, What do you know! So am i
10190,Elena, Do you thing that's really a good idea to be at their house today? Mason Lockwood tried to k*ll you
10191,Katherine, Where is the moonstone?
10192,Mason, Somewhere safe
10193,Katherine, Don't you trust me?
10194,Mason, I don't trust anyone
10195,Stefan, I don't trust Mason. I want to be there today to keep an eye on him
10196,Elena, Okay but then we can't touch or talk and no lingering stares
10197,Stefan," No, none of that"
10198,Elena, What do you think will happen if Katherine founds out that we are fake fighting?
10199,Katherine, Scary will k*ll you
10200,Mason," No, you won't"
10201,Mason," Ouch! Kat, easy! "
10202,Katherine, Did I hurt you? Sorry 
10203,Elena, Ouch 
10204,Stefan, Did it hurt?
10205,Elena," It's okay. A little bit every day to make you stronger, right?"
10206,Mason, What happen once I give you the moonstone?
10207,Katherine, We'll live happily ever after. I promise
10208,Mason," I'll bring it tonight, I promise"
10209,Stefan," I promise, we're gonna get through this"
10210,Elena," I love you, Stefan"
10211,Katherine, You know I love you
10212,Mason, I love you too
10213,Jeremy, I need to talk to you 
10214,Damon, And why I need to talk to you?
10215,Jeremy, Tyler Lockwood has to k*ll someone to activate his curse. He's not a werewolf yet
10216,Damon," Whoa, fascinating. Not enough"
10217,Jeremy," But Mason Lockwood is and he's looking for a moonstone, a special roc related to the werewolves legend. That's why is here"
10218,Damon, A moonstone?
10219,Jeremy, And I know where it is
10220,Damon, And you're bringing me this why?
10221,Jeremy," Do I need a reason? Look, I just want to help, okay?"
10222,Damon, What your sister say about this little discovery?
10223,Damon," Oh, you haven't told her, have you?"
10224,Jeremy," Well, Elena doesn't want me getting involved in all this"
10225,Damon," And you're a Gilbert, you just can't help yourself. Whoa, your search for life's purpose is as obvious as it is tragic"
10226,Jeremy, You're gonna let me in or not?
10227,Carol," Jenna, thanks for helping rundle the volunteers"
10228,Jenna," Off course, for a good cause. Plus, I have always been a sucker for the masquerade ball"
10229,Carol, So was Richard. This was always his favorite party of the year
10230,Carol, Boys! Be careful with that! It's from the eighteen hundreds
10231,Jenna," Stefan, hey! "
10232,Stefan, Hey
10233,Jenna," I'm cooking dinner tonight. Rick will be there, you should come"
10234,Stefan," You know, Elena and I, were kind of taking a pause"
10235,Jenna, Really? That's not what it sounded like this morning. Bad sleeper. You know what? I heard nothing 
10236,Elena, You're here
10237,Bonnie, I'm here
10238,Elena, Caroline's not coming. I told you
10239,Bonnie, Just making sure
10240,Elena," You know, eventually, you're gonna have to talk to her"
10241,Bonnie, Could you make it a little less obvious you're on her side
10242,Elena," There are no sides, Bonnie"
10243,Bonnie," Come on! Since Caroline became a vampire, you barely seen each other. Losing Caroline was bad enough; I didn't think I'd lose you too "
10244,Elena, Come with me
10245,Bonnie, Where?
10246,Elena, Not here. Some place quiet. We have to talk 
10247,Caroline," You didn't eat much. Good news: Doctor Damon said the vervein is almost out of your system. So With any luck, you'll be freshly compelled and back in your own bed by tonight "
10248,Caroline, Are you really just gonna pretend like I don't exist?
10249,Liz, Yes. So please go
10250,Caroline," As usual, you don't care. Got it. Just like before I was a vampire. It's not like I died or anything"
10251,Liz, Are you… Are you really dead?
10252,Caroline," Yes, I am now"
10253,Liz, How is it possible? 
10254,Damon, Rick! 
10255,Alaric, What are you doing here?
10256,Jeremy, Helping Damon. I'm the one who found out about the moonstone
10257,Alaric, does Elena know you're here?
10258,Jeremy, Don't exactly
10259,Damon, What you got?
10260,Alaric, This is Isobel research's from Duke. Her assistant send it to me
10261,Damon," Vanessa, the hottie"
10262,Alaric, Vanessa yes. Do you remember the old Aztecs curse she told us about?
10263,Damon," Son of the moon, bla bla bla bla"
10264,Jeremy, an Aztec curse? Cool
10265,Alaric," Yeah, supposedly vampires and werewolves used to run freely until a shaman put a curse on them, limitating their power. Since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon and vampires are weakened by the sun"
10266,Damon, Most of them anyway
10267,Alaric," According to the legend, the werewolf part of the curse is sealed with a moonstone"
10268,Jeremy, What do you mean sealed?
10269,Damon," It's a witch thing, whatever seals the curse is usually the key onto unsealing the curse "
10270,Alaric, Maybe Mason Lockwood believes he can use the moonstone to break the curse
10271,Damon," If we start believing in some supernatural witchy mojo legend from a picture book, we're idiots. Where is the stone now? "
10272,Jeremy, Tyler 
10273,Damon, Can you get it?
10274,Jeremy, Yeah
10275,Damon," You see, know your life has a purpose "
10276,Jeremy, So you do believe it?
10277,Damon, This is the same book that says the werewolf bite k*ll a vampire. Ignoring it make me an even bigger idiot. Let's go 
10278,Bonnie, I can't believe this
10279,Elena," it's a lot, I know. Katherine's gonna do everything that she can to drive me and Stefan apart and Caroline just got trapped in the middle"
10280,Bonnie," It's not that you and Stefan are pretending to fight, is that I didn't even know you guys were fighting at all"
10281,Elena," I'm sorry, I don't want to keep things from you but you've made it pretty clear where you stand with the whole vampire thing"
10282,Bonnie, So that makes me the unman out
10283,Elena," No, Bonnie, of course not"
10284,Bonnie," I know where I stand, Elena and I know where you stand but where do we stand?"
10285,Elena," You're my best friend, Bonnie. I didn't mean to let this craziness with Caroline get in the way of that but she needs you too"
10286,Bonnie," not yet, I just… she's a vampire, I can't. I think we should get back "
10287,Mason, Hey Stefan
10288,Stefan, Hey Mason
10289,Mason, I wasn't expecting you here or anywhere
10290,Stefan," Yeah, I had this little accident but I'm fine know"
10291,Mason, What did you do to Sheriff Forbes?
10292,Stefan, she's fine too but for now on you'll have to do your own dirty work
10293,Mason, Not a problem
10294,Mason, Excuse me
10295,Stefan, What's the matter? Are you okay?
10296,Bonnie," When I touched him, I saw something"
10297,Stefan, What do you mean? Like a vision?
10298,Bonnie, I saw Elena
10299,Stefan, You saw Elena?
10300,Bonnie, He was kissing her
10301,Stefan," No Bonnie. Elena wouldn't kiss… you didn't see Elena, you saw Katherine "
10302,Elena, Damon. What are you doing here?
10303,Damon, Looking for my baby bro. Speaking of… you should tell yours to stop following me around
10304,Elena, What's going on?
10305,Damon, Ask him
10306,Elena," Jeremy, what is he making you do?"
10307,Jeremy," He's not making me do anything, Damon and i… "
10308,Elena," No way, no, no, no, no. There is no ""Damon and you"". There's Damon and whoever Damon is using, and those people, they end up dead. Whatever is going on Jeremy, I want you to stay out of it"
10309,Jeremy," I don't really care what you want, Elena. It's because of you that I'm in this mess in the first place so I'm sorry, you don't really get to tell me what I'm gonna do "
10310,Damon, Katherine's with Mason Lockwood?
10311,Stefan," You missed it. He got in the town after she did, it makes perfect sense "
10312,Damon," I know but Mason Lockwood?! Werewolf thing aside, the guy is a surfer. She's got to be using him, it has to be"
10313,Stefan, Using him for what?
10314,Damon, Mason Lockwood's looking for a moonstone that allegedly can break the full moon werewolf curse. Maybe Katherine wants it as well
10315,Stefan, Why?
10316,Damon, Well… no idea. This is the beauty of Katherine; she's always up to something
10317,Stefan, So how are we gonna find this moonstone?
10318,Damon, Jeremy is gonna get it from Tyler
10319,Stefan, Why would you involve Jeremy?
10320,Damon," He's playing Indiana Jones, he involved himself"
10321,Matt, She's this amazing girl one minute and then this raging jealous freak the next
10322,Tyler," Look, you know what I think about Caroline Forbes. She's an insecure narcotic bitchy little twig "
10323,Matt, Hey! 
10324,Tyler," But the girl's got heart, she means well. You just get the mean with the best sometimes"
10325,Matt, Yeah. I'm gonna go get an extra. I'll be right back
10326,Jeremy, Hey man 
10327,Tyler, Hey! 
10328,Jeremy," Hey, so I did a little research on that stone you showed me"
10329,Tyler, What? Why?
10330,Jeremy," I don't know. Curiosity, boredom "
10331,Tyler, What did it say?
10332,Jeremy," Well, it turns out that it's part of this Aztec legend but I want to make sure it's the same kind of stone. You think I could check it out again?"
10333,Tyler, No. I gave it to my uncle
10334,Jeremy, Why did you do that?
10335,Tyler," Because I'm done with legends and curses. I don't want anything to do with it, okay?"
10336,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah sure. It's probably… "
10337,Bonnie, Okay. This is as far as I go
10338,Damon, Okay
10339,Bonnie, What do you want?
10340,Damon, A favor 
10341,Bonnie, That's not gonna happen 
10342,Damon, So predictable
10343,Damon, that's why I brought him
10344,Stefan," I know how you feel about helping us out but since you're the one that linked Mason with Katherine, we finally have an opportunity to get an upper hand on both of them so just hear us out "
10345,Damon, Pretty please
10346,Bonnie, I'm listening
10347,Stefan, I have to throw Elena in on what's going on
10348,Stefan, Can you play nice please?
10349,Stefan," Hey, what are you doing? You shouldn't be calling me"
10350,Elena, I know but I have no idea what's happening. Damon's got Jeremy into something and you've got Bonnie with you and I'm sorting stupid masquerade masks for Misses Lockwood
10351,Stefan," Alright, it's okay. Hold on"
10352,Damon, All you have to do is touch Mason Lockwood again to see if he gave Katherine the moonstone
10353,Bonnie, My visions don't work like that; I don't get to ask questions
10354,Damon," How inconvenient. Although, let's about that witchy mojo you do with me. You know the fun one, when my brain burst into flames? What is that?"
10355,Bonnie, That's me giving you an aneurysm. Your bl*od vessels go pop but you heal quickly so I do it over and over again
10356,Damon, Is it vampire specific? 
10357,Bonnie, It'd work on anyone with a supernatural healing ability
10358,Damon," Good. Good, good"
10359,Bonnie," Damon, I'm not gonna help you hurt him"
10360,Damon," Mason Lockwood's a werewolf, Katherine's evil. They're the bad guys. Really? You're gonna play morality police with me right now? Let me explain it to you another way: they're a threat to Elena. You witch, are gonna get over yourself and help us"
10361,Stefan," Yeah, he meant that as a question with a ""please"" on the end"
10362,Damon, Absolutely
10363,Mason," Hey, can you remove you van? I'm blocked in"
10364,Mason," Hey, how did you get stucked to that by yourself?"
10365,Bonnie," All the guys baled. Something about draft pix, I don't know, I don't speak that language"
10366,Mason," Here, let me give you a hand"
10367,Bonnie, Sorry
10368,Caroline, So I mainly drink from bl*od bags. It's not as good as the fresh stuff but it b*at the animal bl*od that Stefan's been trying to get me to drink
10369,Liz, So you steal the bl*od from the hospital? 
10370,Caroline, Damon does. I've been pilfering his supply so…
10371,Liz," As long as you have bl*od, you don't need to k*ll?"
10372,Caroline," I want to. It's my basic nature now but on a healthy diet, I can control it. I'm getting better at it. I'm better than Stefan. He's a bit of a problem drinker, a blood-aholic"
10373,Liz, I don't want this for you
10374,Caroline, I know but when life gives you lemons… Damon's home
10375,Bonnie, Here's his bag as requested
10376,Damon," Okay, grab that corner"
10377,Bonnie, Why are we doing this?
10378,Damon, Because I don't want to stain the carpet
10379,Bonnie, I knew you were gonna say something like that
10380,Damon, You're judging again
10381,Bonnie, He's not gonna be out much longer
10382,Damon, Looks like this guy used to be in tied up 
10383,Damon, What are you doing?
10384,Bonnie, You're looking for a moonstone and I'm trying to help you find it
10385,Damon," Oh good, yeah. Find out if he gave it to Katherine and find out where she is and find out what they're gonna do with it once they get it"
10386,Bonnie," Somewhere small, dark, there's water"
10387,Damon, Like a sewer?
10388,Bonnie, No. Like a well? That can't be right? Yeah. It's a well
10389,Damon, Why would it be in a well?
10390,Bonnie," I told you, I only get what I get"
10391,Bonnie, That's it. That's all I got
10392,Damon, Hey judgy! Thank you
10393,Damon, Come on. Wake up wolf boy
10394,Caroline, Hey! 
10395,Bonnie, Hi. How's your mom? Elena filled me on everything
10396,Caroline, I'm gonna take her home tonight
10397,Bonnie," Caroline… don't remind, I've got to go"
10398,Caroline, Did you find the moonstone thing?
10399,Bonnie," Not yet. Hey, do you remember that old well where we used to play when we were kids?"
10400,Caroline, Yeah
10401,Bonnie, It's on the woods. Do you remember where?
10402,Caroline, On the edge of the old Lockwood property. Why?
10403,Bonnie, I think that's where Mason is keeping the moonstone. I got to go
10404,Caroline," Well, I can go with you"
10405,Bonnie," No, it's okay"
10406,Bonnie, Sure
10407,Caroline, Okay
10408,Matt, So where's Caroline? This is like her thing. I can't believe she's not here
10409,Elena, She has something else to do
10410,Matt, Is she seeing someone?
10411,Elena," Matt, come on. No, she's not"
10412,Tyler, Anyone's seen Mason?
10413,Stefan, He took off. He said he wasn't sure when he'd be back
10414,Tyler, It's so weird
10415,Matt, I'm not even gonna ask
10416,Elena, I'll be right back
10417,Damon, Someone's feisty 
10418,Mason, What?!
10419,Damon," You can hurt, good to know. I was afraid you'd gonna be some beast mess with some with no affinity for pain"
10420,Damon," Oh, you heal quickly. Not good. I guess I'll just have to keep an applying pain"
10421,Damon, So… Katherine. How do you know her? What is she up to?
10422,Damon, I have all day
10423,Elena, What's going on?
10424,Stefan, You shouldn't be here
10425,Elena, I know but I am. What's going on?
10426,Stefan, Bonnie thinks the moonstone is down here
10427,Elena, Hey. Be careful
10428,Stefan, I'll only be down there for a minute
10429,Stefan, Elena! 
10430,Elena, Stefan?!
10431,Stefan, Elena!
10432,Elena," Stefan, what's happening?! What's going on in there?!"
10433,Stefan, Vervein. Oh my god! Help! 
10434,Elena, Stefan!
10435,Caroline, Elena!
10436,Elena," Caroline, Stefan's down there and the chain is rusty"
10437,Elena," No, no, no! You can't, it's full with vervein. Caroline, we've got to get him out. Now!"
10438,Damon, When did you two meet? Did she seduce you and tell she loved you? You're supernatural so she can't compel you. I'm she used her other charms. Katherine's good that way
10439,Damon, I thought I told you to leave
10440,Jeremy, I found something in Rick's boxes stuff
10441,Damon, What is it?
10442,Jeremy," I did a search on my phone, it's a plant: Aconitum Vulparia. Grows in the mountain of the northern hemisphere, communally known as ""Aconite"", ""blue rocket"" and ""Wolf spin"""
10443,Damon, What else did you read? 
10444,Jeremy," Well, every source says something different. One myth says it causes lycanthropy, which sounds bogus. Another one says that it protects people and another one says, well it's toxic"
10445,Damon, I'm guessing toxic
10446,Damon, What's Katherine doing in Mystic falls?
10447,Damon, Why is she here?
10448,Mason, She's here with me! Why are you asking? Jealous?!
10449,Damon, How rude of me. I just realize I didn't offer you anything to eat
10450,Damon, Yummy!
10451,Caroline, I got you okay?
10452,Bonnie, What's going on? You took off in a blur
10453,Caroline," I heard Elena screaming. Help her, now! Are you ready?"
10454,Elena, Yeah
10455,Caroline," Elena, what's going on down there?"
10456,Elena, Follow up!
10457,Caroline, Elena! Ready for you!
10458,Elena, Hold on! I need to find the stone
10459,Caroline, Hurry!
10460,Elena, Hold on! I think I found it!
10461,Caroline, Elena! What's going on?!
10462,Elena," I got it. Come on, bring me up!"
10463,Elena, Oh god! Stefan!
10464,Elena," I've got the stone, Stefan. Stefan, it's gonna be okay, everything's gonna be okay"
10465,Damon, Why do you want the moonstone?
10466,Mason, Screw you!
10467,Damon, Ahhh! Wrong answer!
10468,Jeremy," If he was gonna say anything, he would have already!"
10469,Damon, I'm taking your eyes now
10470,Mason, The well! You'll find it there!
10471,Damon, I know where it is. I want to know what it does and why you want it
10472,Mason, I'm getting it for Katherine
10473,Damon, Why?
10474,Mason, She's gonna use it to lift the curse
10475,Damon," Of the moon? Now, why would a vampire help a werewolf break a curse that keeps him from turning whenever they want?"
10476,Mason, So I wouldn't have to turn anymore
10477,Damon, Why?
10478,Mason, Because she loves me!
10479,Damon," Now I get it. You're just stupid. Katherine doesn't love you, she using you, you moron! "
10480,Mason, I'm done talking
10481,Damon," Yes you are. It's time to take a walk, Jeremy"
10482,Jeremy, I'm staying
10483,Damon," No, you should go"
10484,Jeremy," I'm staying, Damon. He's got enough"
10485,Mason, Just help Tyler. Don't let this happen to him
10486,Jeremy, Damon… 
10487,Damon," You want to be a part of this? Well, here it is! k*ll or be k*ll! The guy is a werewolf; he'll k*ll me the first chance he got so you suck it up or leave! "
10488,Damon," He wants me to k*ll him anyway, don't you Mason? Really is a curse, isn't it?"
10489,Damon," You now, when I look at you I see myself, less dashing and less intelligent version"
10490,Mason, I love her
10491,Damon," Oh, I know! I've been where you are but Katherine will only rip your heart out. Let me do it for her"
10492,Jenna, You're pretty handy with that thing
10493,Alaric," Yeah, uh, it's a k*ll"
10494,Alaric, Where is the sea salt?
10495,Jenna, Table
10496,Caroline," So I pulled Stefan out of this well and he's all verveined and just routed but Bonnie wasn't mean to me once and I really think it's progress, you know? I just… what? I'm freaking you out"
10497,Liz, It's just that you've become tis person….
10498,Caroline, Don't… i… just starting to get along
10499,Liz," This strong, this confident person"
10500,Caroline, Oh. Thank you
10501,Liz," You don't have to take my memories away. I'll keep your secret. Look, if you're worried about them, just say you compelled me. I won't tell. I'll never do anything to hurt you"
10502,Caroline, Why we never talk like this? Never and today meant so much to me
10503,Liz, For me too
10504,Caroline, I know I can trust you but you're never going to trust them
10505,Caroline, I'm going to take you home. You're going to forget that I'm a vampire
10506,Liz, I'm going to forget that you're a vampire
10507,Caroline," You'll remember you got sick with the flu, you had a fever, chills and leakiness but I made you soup and it was really salty. We beggared. You got better and then your selfish little daughter, who loves you no matter what, went right back to ignoring you and all is right in the world "
10508,Damon, All this for that?
10509,Stefan, Yep 
10510,Stefan, I see you've exercised your usual restraint 
10511,Damon, Had to be done
10512,Damon," ""Carol, big opportunity in Florida, I'm gonna be gone for a long time. You'll send for ma things once I get settled. Much love, Mason"""
10513,Stefan, Let's get rid of the body
10514,Damon," Oh, last number dialed. I wonder who that can possibly be"
10515,Stefan," No, no, no! Don't provoke her!"
10516,Katherine," Mason, you should have been here an hour ago"
10517,Damon, Wrong boy toy
10518,Katherine," Damon, for once you surprise me. I guess Mason's with you"
10519,Damon, he's right beside me although his heart he's across the room
10520,Katherine, You shouldn't have
10521,Damon," I've had a very busy day today. I k*ll a werewolf, found the moonstone. Hey, did you know that he hide the moonstone at the bottom of a well full of vervein? I guess he didn't trust you very much but he did love you. Poor guy. Hey, where are you? Because i could bring him over. Last goodbyes and all that"
10522,Katherine, You have no idea what you've just done
10523,Damon," Aww, did I put a kink in your master plan? I'm so sorry"
10524,Katherine," Do you honestly believe that I don't have a plan B? And if that fails a plan C, then a plan D and… you know how the alphabet works, don't you? Send my love to Stefan "
10525,Elena, Where is Jeremy?
10526,Alaric," Oh, he went straight up to his room. He said he's not hungry"
10527,Elena, Who is she talking to?
10528,Alaric, I don't know. Everything go okay today?
10529,Elena, There were a few hick ups but yeah
10530,Jenna," Of course, I understand. Elena, it's for you"
10531,Elena, Who is it? Hello?
10532,Katherine, Hello Elena
10533,Elena, Katherine
10534,Katherine," Did you enjoy your little rendezvous with Stefan this morning? I will always know, Elena. I will always be one step ahead of you. When are you gonna figure that out? Do you know how easy it was to get inside of your house? To replace Aunt Jenna vervein perfume to convince her to stop drinking her special tea?"
10535,Elena, No
10536,Katherine," Jenna's been my little spy for days now. Unlike you, Jenna actually listens to me so when I suggested that the world would be a much better place if she was just…"
10537,Elena, Jenna no!
10538,Katherine," Well, you got the idea"
10539,Jeremy, Is she okay?
10540,Elena, The doctors told Alaric that she got lucky. She's gonna be okay
10541,Jeremy, Did she remember what happened?
10542,Elena," No, nothing. It's all bit of part of Katherine's mind compulsion "
10543,Jeremy, Why would Katherine hurt Aunt Jenna?
10544,Elena," Because she's trying to send a message, that she could get to anybody"
10545,Jeremy," Hey, hey, come here"
10546,Jeremy, It's gonna be okay
10547,Elena, No it's not
10548,Jeremy, She's gonna pay Elena. I don't know how but she's gonna pay 
10549,Tyler, It looks good
10550,Carol, Thanks. It was nice to see Matt today. He hasn't been around for a while
10551,Tyler, We've both been busy I guess. Have you seen Mason? The guy's been off all day
10552,Carol," Actually Tyler, Mason headed back to Florida"
10553,Tyler, What?
10554,Carol," I'm sorry, honey. I know how much you two hinted off"
10555,Tyler, So he just left
10556,Carol," I was hoping he'd stick around, I thought that with your dad gone… anyway, he's gone. So, I guess it's just you and me now "
10557,Stefan, I'm so sorry
10558,Elena," We were stupid. Sniking around, thinking that we weren't gonna get caught"
10559,Stefan, I know
10560,Elena," We did this. Stefan, Jenna's in the hospital and Jeremy could be next all because we didn't listen to her, because we're together. Stefan…"
10561,Stefan, I know what you're gonna say to me
10562,Elena," Then let me say it. I've been so selfish because I love you so much and I know how much you love me but it's over. Stefan, it has to be"
10563,Stefan," Elena, i…"
10564,Elena," No, Stefan. It has to be"
10565,Damon," Elena. I worked Katherine out. I wasn't thinking, I didn't think!"
10566,Elena," It doesn't matter, Damon. She won. Katherine won"
10567,Katherine," I apologize if I seem rattled. The circumstances have changed suddenly and I had to adjust. Mind control is necessarily evil. You see, I need a werewolf and I've lost the one that I had. Now tell me what you're going to do to help me get a new one"
10568,Matt, I'm going to go after Tyler Lockwood
10569,Katherine, And you're not going to stop
10570,Matt, And I'm not going to stop
10571,Katherine, Until?
10572,Matt, Until he k*ll me
10573,Damon, Here
10574,Caroline, I'm still shaking 
10575,Stefan, What happened?
10576,Damon," go ahead, tell him. You're gonna love this"
10577,Caroline, I saw Katherine today
10578,Stefan, Where?
10579,Caroline, At the grill. I just stopped by to gawk and… ‘cause I stuck Matt
10580,Matt, Do you need a table?
10581,Caroline," No, I'm not staying. I just needed to use the little girls' room"
10582,Damon, Skip the teen drama and get 
10583,Caroline, Then I had to pretend to use the bathroom even though I didn't really have to go because I'm defies
10584,Caroline, Elena?
10585,Katherine," Hey, I saw you with Matt, are you okay?"
10586,Caroline," Yeah, you know… whatever "
10587,Katherine, You're good. What gave me away? Was it the hair? Or was it my clothe?
10588,Caroline, I know Elena is… I know Elena's at home
10589,Katherine, I need you to deliver a message
10590,Stefan, What was the message? 
10591,Katherine, Tell Damon and Stefan that I want the moonstone or I will rip this town apart until it rains bl*od
10592,Damon, Tell him the rest of it
10593,Katherine," Tonight, at the masquerade ball"
10594,Stefan, She wants to do it in public. k*ll Mason threw off her guard 
10595,Damon, She's running scared. What she did to Jenna was desperate. She's out of tricks 
10596,Stefan, We can't underestimate her. We have to play this smarter than her
10597,Caroline, Can we just give her the moonstone so she'll leave?
10598,Damon," No, Katherine's not getting dick. I'm gonna go to the masquerade ball and I'm gonna k*ll her, tonight"
10599,Stefan, You're not gonna k*ll her
10600,Damon, Don't give me that goody goody crap 
10601,Stefan, You're not gonna k*ll her
10602,Damon, Really?
10603,Stefan, Because I am
10604,Matt, Easy. Grab the door Jer
10605,Jenna," Hey, stop fussing, I'm fine"
10606,Elena, The doctors said that you have to take it easy
10607,Jeremy," Yeah, you don't want to rip your stiches, hemorrhage and die, alright?"
10608,Jenna," yeah, the only thing I'm gonna die from is embarrassment "
10609,Matt, No
10610,Jenna, I walked into a kn*fe. How does somebody do that?
10611,Elena, It is a freak accident
10612,Jeremy," Yeah, it happens"
10613,Matt," Yeah, I mean I've done it like 20 times at the grill"
10614,Matt," Okay, I'm being nice"
10615,Matt, What should I do with this?
10616,Elena, I got it
10617,Jeremy, So what are we gonna do?
10618,Elena, Make lunch
10619,Jeremy," No, about Katherine"
10620,Elena," We're not gonna do anything, Jeremy"
10621,Jeremy, She tried to k*ll Jenna. We can't let her get away with that
10622,Elena, yes we can. If it keeps us safe then we can
10623,Jeremy, And what if she tries something else?
10624,Elena," She won't. Katherine hurt Jenna because I didn't do what she said. I'm not doing it now, me and Stefan are over. She wins, the end"
10625,Jeremy, You are being naïve and you know it
10626,Elena, Where are you going?
10627,Jeremy, Out. I'll be back
10628,Mrs. Flowers, Where should I put these?
10629,Katherine," Right there. Thank you, Mrs. Flowers. You've been such a wonderful help "
10630,Mrs. Flowers," Oh, it's my pleasure dear. Let me know if there anything else I can do"
10631,Katherine, I will
10632,Lucy," Oh, Kat, chill"
10633,Katherine, Do not snick up on a vampire
10634,Lucy, Don't attack a witch. It's good to see you girl
10635,Katherine, I'm glad you made up
10636,Lucy," You called, I came"
10637,Katherine, Like you had a choice
10638,Lucy, Don't get all boss lady on me. You know I love you
10639,Lucy," Now, where does one where this?"
10640,Katherine, To a masquerade ball. Tonight. You want to be my date?
10641,Caroline," Hey, come on in"
10642,Bonnie, I got Stefan's message
10643,Stefan," Hey, you brought the grimoire, thank you "
10644,Bonnie, What's going on?
10645,Jeremy, We're gonna k*ll Katherine
10646,Stefan, I can explain
10647,Bonnie, Please
10648,Stefan, We're gonna k*ll Katherine
10649,Alaric, This works with compressed air. The trigger mechanism is up here. I have two of these in a different size. For you I recommend this. It feats nicely under the jacket sleeve. You use the trigger when you're ready
10650,Alaric, He wanted me to show him how to k*ll a vampire
10651,Lucy, What's with the hair?
10652,Katherine, I'm impersonating my dullest dishwater doppelganger Elena. She has the worst taste
10653,Lucy, Except in man. Isn't a risk pretending to be her in front of the entire town?
10654,Katherine," I've gotten quite good at it actually and everyone's gonna be in masks. It's for some fid, something charity. It's for a good cause Lucy"
10655,Lucy," Hum, okay. Well, have you actually seen the moonstone before? I always thought it was some made up legend"
10656,Katherine, I have seen it and I need you to help me get it back
10657,Lucy, Oh yeah? What are you gonna do with it?
10658,Lucy, you want me to break the curse
10659,Katherine, Let's just get it first. All i need from you is for a backup. I can't imagine that Damon and Stefan are just gonna hand it over without putting up a fight
10660,Bonnie, I know you love Elena and you want to be with her but it's risky. Too many people could get hurt
10661,Stefan," Look, I want Elena back, yes but it's more than that. What Katherine did to Jenna crossed the line. She has to be stopped before it happens again"
10662,Bonnie," I don't know, Stefan"
10663,Stefan," Look, Katherine knows me, right? She knows that I'm not gonna try something in a crowd full of innocent people so that gives me an edge. I could get to her by surprise"
10664,Bonnie," I could do a spell to trap her, like the tomb spell"
10665,Stefan," Right. We can isolate her, away from the others. Please Bonnie"
10666,Bonnie, Okay
10667,Elena, You're welcome to hang out. Alaric's coming over. It's gonna be pizza and bad TV
10668,Matt," I'd love to but I'm going to the masquerade party at the Lockwood's, aren't you?"
10669,Elena," Uh, no… not with what's going on with me and Stefan"
10670,Matt," I've got to go, there's something I got to do"
10671,Elena, What?
10672,Matt," Just something, I can't talk about it but I've got to go"
10673,Elena," Okay. Well, have fun"
10674,Matt, Yeah. Me and a suit
10675,Elena, You look good in a suit
10676,Matt, You and Stefan are working it out
10677,Elena," I don't think so, Matt. There's so much about me and Stefan that'll never work"
10678,Matt, You know I'm here for you always
10679,Alaric, Are you sure you guys don't want me there tonight?
10680,Stefan," No, I need you to stay with Elena. I don't want her to know about this"
10681,Alaric," Okay. Well, I'll make sure she doesn't leave my side"
10682,Stefan," Alright, if anyone wants to back out, I'll understand"
10683,Damon, Yeah. Cold feats speak now. I don't want this going wrong with someone chicken's out. Caroline?
10684,Caroline," I won't. Look, she k*ll me. Fair's fair. As long there's no werewolf running around"
10685,Damon," Oh, I took care of Mason"
10686,Jeremy," As long as Tyler doesn't k*ll anyone, he won't turn"
10687,Stefan, Bonnie? Are you with this?
10688,Bonnie, But no one gets hurt
10689,Damon, Except Katherine. Tonight Katherine gets a stake through her heart
10690,Carol," It's already packed out there. You know, we need to keep that door sh*t. Your father would be very unhappy if I let gests in here"
10691,Carol," Oh, look at you! So handsome"
10692,Tyler, Thanks. You look pretty good too mom
10693,Carol, Oh a compliment. I think I'll fall over
10694,Tyler," Listen, I'm sorry I've been a dick lately… a jerk lately. It's just… Have you heard from Mason?"
10695,Carol," No and I don't think we're going to. He's coming, he's going, it's just his way. He's the exact opposite of your father"
10696,Tyler, We should have cancel this party
10697,Carol," This all masquerade theme was his idea. I don't know what it has to do with helping the homeless but once he made up his mind, he could really be a dick, a jerk. But I loved him and I know you did too. It's natural to feel abandoned. I just don't want you to feel alone"
10698,Tyler," Come on, put your mask on. Let's just go out there and pretend to have some fun"
10699,Carol, I think I need a cocktail first
10700,Matt, Elena?
10701,Katherine, Matt? You look dashing
10702,Matt, I thought you said you weren't coming
10703,Katherine," I couldn't miss it. You really are hot in a suit. I would love to just… Okay, here's the deal"
10704,Katherine, Do you know what you have to do?
10705,Matt, I'm gonna get Tyler Lockwood really drunk. I'm going to start a fight with him and I'm gonna b*at him until he snaps
10706,Katherine, and then?
10707,Matt, I won't stop until he k*ll me
10708,Katherine," God, you're hot. Now go away"
10709,Matt, Thank you
10710,Damon, Do you see her?
10711,Stefan, Nope. You're sure you can do this?
10712,Damon, Who are you talking to?
10713,Stefan," Oh, I had the chance to k*ll her and I hesitated"
10714,Damon, Well that is the forkenate road between you and me my friend. I don't hesitate
10715,Stefan," You spent 145 years loving her, it could happen"
10716,Damon, I won't hesitate
10717,Stefan, Okay
10718,Tyler, We're really not supposed to be here
10719,Matt," Yeah, I know but we really need to turn this party up. Another sh*t?"
10720,Aimee," Hey, I want a sh*t"
10721,Sarah, Me too and then we have to dance
10722,Aimee, Yes
10723,Tyler," You know, usually it's me corrupting you. I like this"
10724,Aimee," Okay, let's go party. Come on"
10725,Jeremy, I thought this room could work
10726,Bonnie, It's perfect
10727,Jeremy, Is that the spell book I read about in my family's old journal?
10728,Bonnie," it's my ancestor, Emily's. The spell I'm doing here is similar to the one that sealed the vampires into the tomb"
10729,Jeremy, Can you do all the stuff that's in there?
10730,Bonnie," I mean it takes practice. I've worked on some small spells. Spells that only do good. I don't want to know too much. I don't particularly enjoy any of this, in case you haven't noticed "
10731,Jeremy," Yeah but you're 100% witch, that is so cool"
10732,Bonnie, it's anything but cool. Did your family's journal tell you what happened to Emily? Or what about my gram's? It never ends well for people like me
10733,Jeremy," If you feel that way, why help?"
10734,Bonnie, Because I don't want anyone else getting hurt and I don't know how to stay out of it
10735,Jenna, I feel like an invalid
10736,Elena, That's because you are invalid. Where's Jeremy? Isn't he hungry?
10737,Jenna, He already left for the Lockwood party
10738,Elena, He went to that?
10739,Jenna," Yeah, I'm glad. He needs to have more fun. Lose some of that emo thing"
10740,Elena, I'm gonna get some napkins 
10741,Elena, what's going on?
10742,Alaric, What do you mean?
10743,Elena, I haven't heard from anyone all day. It's like everyone's been avoiding me and now Jeremy's supposedly at the party? He hates stuff like that
10744,Alaric," I don't know what to tell you, Elena"
10745,Elena," So then it'll be okay if I just head down, try to meet up with everyone"
10746,Alaric," Wait, wait, wait"
10747,Elena," What are you hiding, Rick?"
10748,Alaric," Stefan asked me to keep an eye on you, just in case Katherine showed up while he was at the party"
10749,Elena, So Stefan's at the party too? He would never go to the party for himself; he did that stuff for me
10750,Alaric, Just let this one go. Okay Elena?
10751,Bonnie, We need to let Stefan and Damon know the room's ready
10752,Bonnie, Do you feel that?
10753,Jeremy, What's the matter? Are you cold?
10754,Bonnie, No
10755,Bonnie," Excuse me, do I know you?"
10756,Lucy," No, I'm a plus one, I know no one but it's a great party though "
10757,Jeremy, Are you okay?
10758,Bonnie, I just got a weird vibe. Let's find Damon
10759,Katherine, Dance with me
10760,Stefan, No
10761,Katherine," Fine then tell me who I should k*ll. Him? Hum, she looks delicious"
10762,Katherine, It's a beautiful night
10763,Stefan, Why all that charade?
10764,Katherine, How's Jenna? I certainly didn't expect her to survive that. Lucky girl. Clumsy. How does one stabs oneself?
10765,Stefan, Katherine?
10766,Katherine, Uh?
10767,Stefan, I don't want anyone to get hurt tonight
10768,Katherine, Okay. Then give me the moonstone and nobody will
10769,Stefan," Well, you see, I don't have the moonstone on me. So, you and I will have to go get it together"
10770,Katherine, Hmm. I have a better plan. You go fetch it and I will try not to k*ll anyone in the meantime
10771,Stefan, My way or you don't get it
10772,Aimee," Hey Stefan, I can't find Matt. Oh my god Elena! You look so pretty. I love that dress. You look gorge "
10773,Katherine, Thank you. I love your necklace 
10774,Aimee," Oh, thanks"
10775,Katherine," Oh it's twisted. Let me, here we go"
10776,Katherine, Paralyzed from the waist down and dead
10777,Katherine," The moonstone, Stefan. Tic-tac"
10778,Elena," Hey guys, I'm gonna go to bed. You're good over there?"
10779,Jenna, Good night
10780,Elena, Good night
10781,Stefan, I put the body in the trunk for now
10782,Damon, We'll dump her when we get back
10783,Stefan," This is exactly why I didn't want it, Damon"
10784,Damon," Stefan, it's a collateral damage "
10785,Stefan," Right, which is why we need to cut it off "
10786,Damon," What? Who's hesitating now? Hey! Don't do this to me! This woman ruined our lives, she destroyed us! Tonight it ends. We can do it together. I got your back. Alright?"
10787,Stefan, Alright
10788,Jeremy, So can you use like a hocus pocus to pass a test?
10789,Bonnie, I don't know that spell
10790,Jeremy, It'd be like the first one I'd learn or maybe like a spell sex or something. I don't know. Do you want to dance or something while we're waiting?
10791,Bonnie, No! I mean no thank you
10792,Lucy, You didn't tell me there was another witch here
10793,Katherine, Didn't i?
10794,Lucy," No, you didn't. No one is supposed to know I'm involved. This changes things, Katherine"
10795,Katherine," This changes nothing. You're here because you owe your dear friend a favor. You wouldn't want to lose my friendship now, would you?"
10796,Jeremy, Elena
10797,Jeremy," Hey sorry, could I talk to my sister?"
10798,Katherine, What is it Jeremy?
10799,Jeremy, I have a message from Stefan
10800,Katherine, Oh?
10801,Jeremy, He and Damon want you to meet them at the edge of the lake by the woods. They brought the moonstone
10802,Katherine, And why are you their little messenger?
10803,Jeremy, Because they know I'm not afraid of you
10804,Katherine," Hmm, you Gilbert men, so courageous. How's John by the way? Were they able to sew his fingers back on?"
10805,Elena, What the hell is going on?
10806,Katherine, What are Stefan and Damon up to?
10807,Caroline, What do you mean?
10808,Katherine, I've got Jeremy Gilbert luring me into the lake. What's going on?
10809,Caroline, I don't know… nothing
10810,Katherine," Don't lie to me, Caroline. They're up to something, what is it?"
10811,Caroline, I…
10812,Caroline," Wait, no, no, no! Okay. They're trying to k*ll you"
10813,Katherine, I wouldn't have guessed. Where is the moonstone? 
10814,Caroline, Bonnie has it
10815,Katherine, and where is Bonnie right now?
10816,Caroline, I don't know
10817,Caroline," Okay. She's upstairs, she's upstairs!"
10818,Elena, You guys are trying to k*ll her here?
10819,Jeremy, We saw an opportunity and we knew we had to take it
10820,Elena," Okay, stop with the ""we"", are you guys crazy? You're gonna get yourselves k*ll"
10821,Bonnie," We know what we are doing, Elena"
10822,Elena, And how am I supposed to feel if one of you guys gets hurt because of me?
10823,Jeremy," It's not just you anymore, Elena. She's messed with all of us, she has to be stopped"
10824,Caroline, Why you keep dragging me into this? I don't want any part of it
10825,Katherine, Shut up!
10826,Katherine, Which room is it?
10827,Caroline, It's that one
10828,Katherine, Where is she? 
10829,Caroline, I did it. I really didn't think that I'll be able to fool you but I did it
10830,Katherine, What the…? Stefan?
10831,Stefan, Hello Katherine
10832,Caroline, Goodbye Katherine
10833,Katherine," You don't really think that you can k*ll me with that now, do you?"
10834,Stefan, No but he can
10835,Jeremy, What's going on?
10836,Bonnie," Jeremy, it's Katherine. She's linked to Katherine, get them to stop! Now!"
10837,Jeremy, Stop! You're hurting Elena! Everything you're doing to her is hurting Elena
10838,Katherine, You think you two are the only ones with a witch on your side? Wrong and something tells me that my witch is better than your witch
10839,Stefan," Jeremy, go shake on Elena. Make sure she's okay. Go!"
10840,Katherine, Let's all make sure poor Elena is okay. Just a little bit of pressure
10841,Elena," Bonnie, it hurts"
10842,Bonnie," I can't break the spell, Elena. I'm sorry but I can try to take some of the pain away. Okay?"
10843,Bonnie," Ascinda, mulaf, hinto, ascinda… "
10844,Katherine, This is really gonna hurt
10845,Damon, Wait!
10846,Katherine," Okay. So, how about that moonstone?"
10847,Jeremy, Are you okay?
10848,Elena, Are they?
10849,Jeremy, They're stuck in there with her
10850,Jeremy, You were right; Katherine had a witch that linked Elena to her
10851,Bonnie," The girl I saw, the one inside! Stay with her, keep pressure on her shoulder!"
10852,Jeremy, Where are you going?
10853,Bonnie," There's another witch here, I'm gonna find her!"
10854,Elena, No
10855,Jeremy, Take it
10856,Elena," No, Jeremy…"
10857,Jeremy, Elena listen to me: you need this more than I do
10858,Elena, No Jeremy. What I need is for you to be safe
10859,Katherine, The three of us together just like old times. The brother who loved me too much and the one that didn't love me enough
10860,Damon, And the evil slut vampire who only loved herself
10861,Katherine, What happened to you Damon? You used to be so sweet and polite
10862,Damon, Oh that Damon died a long time ago
10863,Katherine, Good. He was a bore
10864,Stefan," Oh, why don't you two stop antagonizing each other"
10865,Katherine, Where is the moonstone?
10866,Stefan, What do you want with it?
10867,Katherine, Does Elena enjoy having both of you warship at her alter? 
10868,Stefan," That was really desperate, Katherine. Don't you think that we can see right through you?"
10869,Katherine, So it doesn't bother you that Damon's in love with your girlfriend? 
10870,Stefan," Oh, stop it"
10871,Katherine, Or what? You'll hurt me? 
10872,Katherine," Come on, Stefan. Everything that I feel, Elena feels , so go ahead"
10873,Katherine," Or better yet, kiss me Damon. She'll feel that too"
10874,Stefan," You know, this all Mason thing has me a bit confused. Why a werewolf? The moonstone can break a curse that would help them destroy all vampires so what's in there for you?"
10875,Damon," Sorry about your pet wolf, you should have been sure to keep him in a tighter leash "
10876,Katherine, I'll have to remember that for next time. He's not the only wolf in town
10877,Sarah, So what happened to Aimee?
10878,Matt," I don't know, she disappeared "
10879,Tyler, She's probably drunk somewhere
10880,Matt, Or like me
10881,Tyler," Whoa, don't do that"
10882,Matt, What man? It's a party
10883,Matt," Right dad? You know, it's like your dad wants to drink"
10884,Tyler," Hey, it's not cool. What's wrong with you?"
10885,Matt," Come on, the guy was a dick"
10886,Sarah," Come on, you're being mean. His dad's dead"
10887,Tyler, Give me the picture!
10888,Matt, Remember how your dad used to slap you around?
10889,Tyler, Are you kidding?
10890,Matt, I'm just having fun
10891,Tyler, Put the picture down now man
10892,Tyler," Okay, you need to calm your drunk ass right now! "
10893,Matt, Do something about it!
10894,Tyler, I'm not gonna fight you
10895,Caroline, What is going on? Stop!
10896,Matt," I can't! Let me go, I have to finish!"
10897,Tyler, What the hell is going on with you?
10898,Matt, Let me go!
10899,Caroline, Matt?
10900,Tyler, How did you?
10901,Sarah," Matt failed. If Matt fails, I can't "
10902,Caroline," Tyler, look out! "
10903,Tyler," No, no, no! Come on, wake up! Sarah, open your eyes, wake up! Just can't happen, oh no, it can't happen. This can't be happening! Sarah! Sarah, get up! Sarah! Open your eyes! This can't be happening!"
10904,Caroline," Tyler? Tyler?! Tyler, what's happening?"
10905,Tyler, Get away! 
10906,Caroline, What's happening?!
10907,Damon, Damn it! Where is that witch?
10908,Katherine, We could play charades
10909,Stefan, You bargained the moonstone
10910,Damon, What do you murmur about over there?
10911,Stefan," When you shopped a deal with George Lockwood, to help you fake your death, you told me that you gave George something he needed. It was the moonstone, wasn't it?"
10912,Katherine," Good for you, Stefan. 2+2… And it would have worked except that people found out that I wasn't in the tomb"
10913,Katherine, Thanks to you by the way. Have I mentioned how inconvenient your little obsession with me have been?
10914,Damon," You and me both, honey"
10915,Stefan, Why do you need it back?
10916,Katherine," I love you in a suit, so dashing"
10917,Stefan, What were you doing with it in the first place?
10918,Damon," You're wasting your breath, Stefan "
10919,Stefan," Unless it wasn't yours to begin with. In 1864 you faked your death. Who were you running from, Katherine?"
10920,Katherine," In 1987 you were in Chicago, at a concert of all places with that wrench Lexi. Come on Stefan, don't look so surprise. Of course I checked on you over the years. You were standing in the front row, dancing all night. You were watching Bon Jovi and I was watching you"
10921,Stefan, Who were you running from?
10922,Lucy, You're looking for me?
10923,Bonnie, Who are you?
10924,Lucy, Lucy
10925,Bonnie, What are you doing here?
10926,Lucy, I should have known I'd run into a Bennett 
10927,Bonnie, How do you know me?
10928,Lucy," You'll figure it out. Look, I have no interest in fighting you"
10929,Bonnie, Then stop the spell you put on my friend
10930,Lucy, Give Katherine the moonstone and I will
10931,Bonnie, Why are you helping Katherine? Don't you know what she is?
10932,Lucy, Tell your friends to hand over the moonstone and all will be groovy 
10933,Bonnie, You're not leaving this room until you stop the spell!
10934,Lucy," Look, I don't want to hurt you"
10935,Bonnie, I don't want to hurt you
10936,Lucy," Look, I don't have a choice. The bitch saved my life and now I owe her. I have to pay up"
10937,Lucy, You have the moonstone. I cans sense it on you
10938,Lucy," Do you feel that? You can trust me. Give it to me, it's okay"
10939,Katherine, We're missing the party. I'll have one of those
10940,Damon, Right away Miss Katherine
10941,Katherine, Thank you
10942,Stefan," No, no! Damon, don't! "
10943,Katherine," Yes, Damon, please"
10944,Damon," The second the spell is lifted, I'm gonna drive a stake right through your heart"
10945,Elena," God, you're hot. When did you get so hot?"
10946,Lucy," Katherine, the spell in this room has been broken, you're free to leave"
10947,Katherine, Thank god
10948,Lucy, When I hand this over my dent to you is over
10949,Katherine, Done
10950,Lucy, I owe you nothing
10951,Katherine, I said done. Give it
10952,Damon, I wouldn't do that
10953,Lucy," You should have told me another witch was involved. She's a Bennett witch, Katherine but I'm sure you knew that"
10954,Stefan," Wait, Elena!"
10955,Lucy, Elena's fine
10956,Lucy," The spell is broken. She'll heal quickly, Bonnie's with her"
10957,Lucy, I apologize for my involvement
10958,Caroline," Matt and I were fighting, we broke up you know, and Sarah was drunk and dancing and she just tripped. And then she wasn't breathing"
10959,Carol," Okay, your mom's on her way and we called Sarah's parents. It was an accident. It was a terrible, tragic accident"
10960,Tyler," Mom, the sheriff's here"
10961,Carol," I'll go prepare her, just don't leave. Just stay here okay? She's going to want to hear the story from you"
10962,Caroline," Matt's in the car, sleeping it off. I'll deal with him; I don't want him involved in any of this"
10963,Tyler, What are you doing?
10964,Caroline, I'm fixing a very bad situation
10965,Tyler, Why? I did this. I k*ll her
10966,Caroline," No, you didn't mean to and I think it's best for everyone…"
10967,Tyler, But she's dead! You don't know what that means
10968,Caroline," Actually, Tyler, I think I do"
10969,Tyler," No, you don't, Caroline"
10970,Caroline, Has you wound healed?
10971,Tyler, How did you…?
10972,Bonnie," Please, wait"
10973,Lucy," Hey, I'm sorry about that spell. Damn vampires, they put you in the middle of it every time"
10974,Bonnie," How do I know you? When I gave you the stone, how did I know I could trust you?"
10975,Lucy," That feeling you got, have you ever felt it before?"
10976,Bonnie," I mean, around family. My grams"
10977,Lucy," My mother is Johanna, first cousin twice remove from Pauline, niece of Sheila aka…"
10978,Bonnie, Grams? We are related?
10979,Lucy," Yeah, we kind of are. It's nice to meet you Bonnie. Seeing you tonight was a wakeup call for me. I got to stop letting vampires control me. So thank you for that"
10980,Bonnie," Please, don't leave! I have so many questions. I don't want to be in the middle either. I hate it. How do I stay out of it?"
10981,Lucy," Unlike me, you're one of the good ones, Bonnie. The middle of it is exactly where you need to be. You take care cuz'. Don't worry, you'll see me again"
10982,Jeremy," Hey, I was gonna head home, can I offer you a ride? Are you okay?"
10983,Bonnie, When did you get your driver's license? 
10984,Jeremy," I'm not a kid anymore, Bonnie"
10985,Bonnie, I'd love a ride home
10986,Stefan, Elena
10987,Elena," I'm okay, I'm okay. Bonnie took away the pain and I think I'm healing"
10988,Stefan, I know but I think you should definitely see a doctor anyway
10989,Elena," I will. I heard about Katherine, is it true? Is she really gone?"
10990,Stefan," Yeah, I was so worried about you"
10991,Elena, Stefan… I…
10992,Stefan," Katherine being gone doesn't change anything for you, does it?"
10993,Elena," I want to be with you, Stefan. You know that but first, I need to wake up and know that the people that I love are safe. I need to feel safe. Do you understand?"
10994,Stefan," Yeah. Yeah, I understand "
10995,Damon, Hello Katherine
10996,Katherine, Where am i?
10997,Damon," Where you should have been all along. I thought you'd learn your lesson by now, messing with a Bennett witch "
10998,Katherine, You should have k*ll me
10999,Damon, Death would have been too kind
11000,Katherine," Ni, Damon, don't. Damon, don't. You need me, Elena's in danger. "
11001,Damon, From whom?
11002,Damon," You're lying, you're always lying"
11003,Elena," Why do you think I haven't k*ll her? Because she's the doppelganger, she needs to be protected"
11004,Damon, Then I'll protect her while you rot in hell
11005,Katherine," Damon, don't! I'll do anything, please. Damon! You need me! You need me! "
11006,Elena," Yeah Jeremy, I've got my car. Tell Bonnie that whatever she did, I'm starting to feel better. Yeah, you can drive her home. I'm just gonna go straight to bet. Okay"
11007,Trevor, Where is she?
11008,Man," In the trunk, I did exactly what you said"
11009,Trevor," Good, put her in the back "
11010,Trevor, thank you for your help
11011,Man, Is there anything else?
11012,Trevor," One more thing. Come closer, please"
11013,Trevor, Closer
11014,Jeremy," Yo, Elena! "
11015,Caroline, So Sarah attacks Tyler and he pushed her away and she tripped and she fell and she hit her head
11016,Damon, Does Matt remember anything?
11017,Caroline," Hmm, he thinks he blacked out but I think they were both compelled by Katherine. That's why I covered for Tyler and said it was an accident"
11018,Damon," Yeah, I don't understand that. The guy is a tool"
11019,Caroline," Gee, dah. Tyler getting blamed for Sarah death just opens up questions that can't answer and do you really think that's a good idea for him to tell his mom he's a werewolf?"
11020,Damon," Well, no"
11021,Caroline, And that werewolf road leads straight to Vampire Boulevard! I thought I was thinking fast on my feet
11022,Damon, Where is your mom?
11023,Caroline, Leading the search party for Aimee Bradley. They haven't found her body yet
11024,Damon," Ah, teens today and their underage drinking. Tragic. Wait, did you see Tyler's eyes turn yellow?"
11025,Caroline, They were more gold with amber highlights
11026,Damon, Oh 
11027,Caroline, Can he turn into a wolf now?
11028,Damon, Only on a full moon but now he has craze strength and who knows what else. I wonder how much Mason told him. Does he know about us?
11029,Damon, Hey! What did you tell him?
11030,Caroline," nothing, really. I don't think he knows much of anything. He seemed really freaked out and honestly, I felt kind of bad for him"
11031,Damon, He's got to know something
11032,Caroline," Alright, I'll ask him"
11033,Damon," No, you won't Caroline! He cannot know about us. The bite from a werewolf can k*ll a vampire so don't be his friend! Do you understand me?"
11034,Caroline, I understand. I'm late for school
11035,Damon," Right. If you want to drop the hints to your mom, Aimee's body is at the bottom of a ravine with the crack spine. Might save your mom some time"
11036,Stefan, Hey Jeremy
11037,Jeremy," Look, Elena's got to let me know if I'm supposed to cover for her. Jenna's cool with the two of you but you guys are pushing it"
11038,Stefan, What are you talking about?
11039,Jeremy," You and Elena. Look, I'm glad you guys are back together but if she's gonna sleep over…"
11040,Stefan," Wait, wait… hold on a minute. We're not back together"
11041,Jeremy, Wait… she didn't stay at your place last night?
11042,Stefan," No, I mean I saw her at the party but that was it. She didn't sleep over"
11043,Jeremy, ‘Cause her bed hadn't been slept in and Mrs. Lockwood said that her car was still in the driveway. Where is she then?
11044,Elena, What do you want?
11045,Trevor, Shut
11046,Elena," Please, I'm hurt"
11047,Trevor, I know. Just a taste
11048,Rose, Trevor! Control yourself
11049,Trevor, Boss k*ll 
11050,Elena, What do you want with me?
11051,Rose," Oh my god, you look just like her"
11052,Elena," But I'm not. Please, whatever you…"
11053,Rose, Be quiet!
11054,Elena, But I'm not Katherine. My name is Elena Gilbert; you don't have to do this
11055,Rose," I know who you are, I said be quiet"
11056,Elena, What do you want?
11057,Rose, I want you to be quiet
11058,Stefan, This is Katherine right all over it
11059,Damon, Katherine's in the tomb. Trust me; I'm the one who shut her in
11060,Stefan, Did you?
11061,Damon," Did I what, Stefan?"
11062,Stefan," Well, I know the hold that Katherine has on you"
11063,Damon," she's in the tomb, period. End of story but she did say something to me right before I shut her in. I thought she was lying "
11064,Stefan, what did she say?
11065,Damon, Elena's in danger
11066,Stefan, What? And you didn't think you should ask her to elaborate?
11067,Damon, Everything she says is a lie. How am I supposed to know she was starting spelling off the truth?
11068,Stefan, We have to go talk to her
11069,Damon," No, no. Let me tell you how that's gonna go: We're gonna go ask her for help, she's gonna negotiate her release which we should dumb enough to get her and she's gonna get out and k*ll us! This is exactly what she wants!"
11070,Stefan, I don't really care
11071,Damon," It's a bad idea, Stefan"
11072,Stefan, It's Elena
11073,Tyler, Caroline
11074,Caroline, Hey! How are you doing?
11075,Tyler, Not good
11076,Caroline, How's your mom? My mom said that she was pretty freaked out about everything that happened with Sarah
11077,Tyler, How did you know?
11078,Caroline, What do you mean?
11079,Tyler, About me. How did you know?
11080,Caroline, Know what? That you were upset? I thought I was doing a good thing by covering for you
11081,Tyler, That's not what I am talking about
11082,Caroline," Look, it was an accident? Okay? And I've got to run but please don't blame yourself"
11083,Rose, How does it go?
11084,Trevor, Still passed out
11085,Rose," You didn't touch her, did you?"
11086,Trevor," Give me some credit. So, did you called him? "
11087,Rose," No, I called one of his contacts. You know how this works"
11088,Trevor, Did you or did you not get the message to Elijah? 
11089,Rose, they say he got it
11090,Trevor, Wonderful and what?
11091,Rose, So that's it Trevor. He either got it or he didn't. We just have to wait
11092,Trevor," Look, it's not too late. We can leave it here. We don't have to go through with this"
11093,Rose, I'm sick of running!
11094,Trevor," Yeah? Well, running keeps us from dying "
11095,Rose," Elijah's old school. If he accepts our deal, we're free"
11096,Rose," You! There's nothing around here from miles. If you think you're getting out of this house, you're tragically wrong. Understand?"
11097,Elena, Who's Elijah?
11098,Rose, He's your worst nightmare
11099,Bonnie," I can't undo the tomb spell, Stefan. Even if I wanted to. It took all from me and Grams to undo it the first time"
11100,Stefan," But I can open the door, right? I can talk to her?"
11101,Bonnie," Yeah but Damon's right. She's not gonna tell you anything, not without something in return"
11102,Stefan, I know but Bonnie I have to do something. I have no idea who has Elena; I have no idea where she is
11103,Bonnie, What if there was another way to find her?
11104,Jeremy, How this is work?
11105,Bonnie, I‘ll use your bl*od dry the energy for the tracking spell. You're bl*od related; it'll make the connection stronger
11106,Stefan," Alright, Alaric said we've got to clear out of here within 10 minutes. I've got w*apon he's stuck me up "
11107,Bonnie, Are you ready?
11108,Bonnie, There. She's there
11109,Jeremy, That's 300 miles away
11110,Stefan, No Bonnie. We need a more exact location than that
11111,Bonnie, That's the closest I can get
11112,Jeremy," We can map it, area view will show us what's around there, help us bound the area"
11113,Stefan, Perfect. Call me with whatever you find
11114,Jeremy," No, no, I'm coming with you!"
11115,Stefan," No Jeremy, you're not"
11116,Jeremy," no, I'm gonna just sit here. What if she's hurt okay?"
11117,Jeremy, Or worse? What if she's…?
11118,Stefan, She's not. You two go back to your house just in case. I'll call you the minute I find her
11119,Jeremy, But you can't do this alone
11120,Damon, He's not. Let's go
11121,Stefan, You're coming with me?
11122,Damon, It's Elena
11123,Caroline, Hey. Hums… are you okay?
11124,Tyler, You lied to me earlier. Why?
11125,Caroline," Look, Tyler… I think that you misunderstood me at the party. I get it, it was very dramatic"
11126,Tyler, You're lying
11127,Caroline, Nope but I'm late
11128,Tyler, Hey!
11129,Tyler, How did you… you're stronger than me?
11130,Caroline," Please, that was nothing"
11131,Tyler," Listen, if you know something you've got to tell me because I can't handle this"
11132,Caroline," I'm sorry, Tyler but I think that you're still in shock over Sarah dying and it's understandable "
11133,Damon, Alaric sure likes his w*apon
11134,Damon, What the hell is that?
11135,Stefan," I don't know, it's a vervein b*mb or a grenade or something like that"
11136,Damon, Weird
11137,Stefan," Hey, how much further is it?"
11138,Damon, About 80 miles
11139,Stefan, Who do you think took her?
11140,Damon, Someone from Katherine's past. She said she was running from someone. They pick out the wrong girl
11141,Stefan, Thank you for helping me
11142,Damon, Can we not do the whole road trip bonding thing? The cliché of it all makes me itch
11143,Stefan," Oh, come on Damon. We both know that you being in this car have absolutely nothing to do with me anyway "
11144,Damon, The elephant in the room lets out a mighty roar
11145,Stefan," Well, it doesn't have to be an elephant. Let's talk about it."
11146,Damon, There's nothing to talk about
11147,Stefan," That's not true. I'm sure there is. Just get it out. I mean, are you in this car because you want to help your little brother save the girl that he loves? Or is it because you love her too? Hmm? I mean come on, express yourself. I happen to like road trip bonding"
11148,Damon," Keep it up, Stefan. I can step out of helping as easily as I stepped in"
11149,Stefan," No, you see that's the beauty of it. You can't"
11150,Bonnie, Alaric just left with Jenna
11151,Jeremy, He's getting her out of the house for a while so she doesn't ask questions about Elena. Look. I pulled this up based on that spun on the map
11152,Jeremy, there's nothing for miles except for this old house
11153,Bonnie, Did you send it to Stefan?
11154,Jeremy," Yeah. I hate sitting here, waiting like this"
11155,Bonnie," Hey, she's gonna be fine"
11156,Jeremy, You don't know that
11157,Bonnie, No I don't
11158,Jeremy, What are you doing?
11159,Bonnie, There's something else I want to try
11160,Jeremy, I don't get it
11161,Bonnie, I need a candle. Grab Elena's hairbrush
11162,Jeremy," Okay, yeah"
11163,Jeremy, What's all this stuff for?
11164,Bonnie, I know it's crazy but I might be able to get her a message
11165,Jeremy, Bonnie? Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! 
11166,Jeremy, Bonnie
11167,Jeremy, Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie!
11168,Elena, Why am I here?
11169,Rose, You keep asking me these questions like I'm gonna answer them 
11170,Elena, Why won't you?
11171,Rose, hat's another one
11172,Elena," You got me, okay? It's not like I can go anywhere. The least you can do is tell me what you want with me"
11173,Rose, I personally want nothing; I'm just a delivery service
11174,Elena, Delivery to whom? Elijah? 
11175,Rose, Two points for these ears dropper 
11176,Elena, Who is he? Is he a vampire?
11177,Rose," He's one of the vampires, the originals "
11178,Elena, What do you mean the originals?
11179,Rose, Again with the questions. Haven't the Salvatore's been teaching you vampire history?
11180,Elena, So you know Stefan and Damon
11181,Rose," I know of them. A hundred years back, a friend of mine tried to set me up with Stefan. She said he was one of the good ones. I'm more a sucker for the bad boys though but I digress "
11182,Elena, Who are the originals?
11183,Rose," Trevor and I I've been running for 500 years. We're tired, we want it over. We're using you to negotiate ourselves out of an old mess"
11184,Elena, But why me?
11185,Rose, Because you are a Petrova doppelganger. You're the key into breaking the curse
11186,Elena, The curse? The sun and the moon curse?
11187,Rose," Oh, you do know your history"
11188,Elena, What do you mean I'm the key? The moonstone is what breaks the curse
11189,Rose," No, the moonstone is what binds the curse. The sacrifice will breaks it "
11190,Elena, The sacrifice?
11191,Rose," The bl*od of the doppelganger. You are the doppelganger. Which means, in order to break the curse you are the one who has to die "
11192,Caroline, Mom?
11193,Caroline, What are you doing here?
11194,Tyler, I know
11195,Caroline, Breaking and entering the sheriff's house? That move will win you an award
11196,Tyler," Go ahead. Keep dodging, keep changing the subject but I know. You're just like me, aren't you?"
11197,Caroline, No
11198,Tyler, Keep it up but I'm not buying it. I saw how strong you are. I'm not leaving here until you tell me the truth
11199,Caroline, Tyler…
11200,Tyler, You're a werewolf. Say it!
11201,Caroline, What?
11202,Tyler, Stop lying! 
11203,Caroline, I'm not lying! 
11204,Tyler, Say it!
11205,Caroline," I'm not a werewolf, okay?"
11206,Elena, Tell me more
11207,Trevor," Captivity has made her pushy, uh? What do you want to know doppelicious? "
11208,Elena, Who were you running from?
11209,Trevor, The originals
11210,Elena," Yeah, she said that. What does it mean?"
11211,Trevor," The first family, the old world. Rose and I pissed them off"
11212,Rose, hum hum
11213,Trevor," Correction, I pissed them off, Rose had my back and for over half a millennium, they wanted us dead"
11214,Elena, What did you do?
11215,Rose, He made the same mistake others did: he trusted Katerina Petrova
11216,Elena, Katherine
11217,Rose," The one and only, the first Petrova doppelganger"
11218,Trevor," I helped her to escape her fate and now I've, sorry, we've been locked ever since"
11219,Rose, Which is why we're not gonna make the same mistake again
11220,Jeremy," Here, drink this"
11221,Bonnie, Thanks
11222,Jeremy, What happened? You scared the hell out of me
11223,Bonnie, it's nothing
11224,Jeremy," it wasn't nothing, Bonnie"
11225,Bonnie, I've been doing a lot of magic lately. It wares me down. 
11226,Jeremy," When I'm warring down, I take a nap. You were… you were unconscious"
11227,Bonnie," Witchcraft has its limits. If I push too hard, it pushes back"
11228,Jeremy, How do you know all this?
11229,Bonnie, It's all in here; it's like a reminder that I'm not invincible. Please don't… don't tell anyone
11230,Jeremy, why not?
11231,Bonnie, Because it's a weakness and I don't want certain people to know that
11232,Jeremy," By certain people, you mean Damon"
11233,Bonnie, I mean anyone that can hurt me
11234,Jeremy," I won't tell anyone, okay? I promise"
11235,Bonnie," It's hard you know? My gram is gone and my dad, he doesn't want to know about what I am. He hasn't since my mom left. I'm all alone in this"
11236,Jeremy," It's how I feel a lot of the time, alone"
11237,Jeremy, Do you think that worked?
11238,Bonnie, I have no idea
11239,Stefan, We're getting close. Jeremy said there was an access road just past mar marker 6
11240,Damon," If you want some, just ask"
11241,Stefan, I want some
11242,Damon," Ah, it's so sweet. You're gonna be all big and strong and save your girl but don't worry, I've got your back. It'll be fine"
11243,Stefan, I'm not joking. I've been drinking a little every day. I's slowly increasing my intake and building up my strength 
11244,Damon, Does Elena know you're drinking bl*od?
11245,Stefan, I've been drinking hers 
11246,Damon," Hmm, how romantic. Since we're road trip bonding, remember the days when all you lived for was bl*od? You were the guy who ripped someone apart just for the fun of it"
11247,Stefan, You mean when I was more like you?
11248,Damon," Yes, Stefan, exactly. Back when you put bl*od into me so I could be a big bad vampire. I wonder if Elena would be so quick to open her veins to that guy. By the way, what happened to that guy? He was a hoop"
11249,Stefan, I guess he found someone else to leave for 
11250,Trevor, He's here! This was a mistake
11251,Rose," no, I told you I would get us out of this. You have to trust me"
11252,Trevor," No! He wants me dead, Rose!"
11253,Rose, He wants her more
11254,Trevor," I can't do this. You give her to him, he let you leave but I need to get out of here"
11255,Rose, Hey! What are we?
11256,Trevor," We're family, forever"
11257,Elena, You're scared
11258,Rose, Stay here with her and don't make a sound
11259,Elijah, Rose-Marie. Is there somewhere we can talk?
11260,Rose," Yes, in here. You have to forgive the house"
11261,Elijah," Oh, no, what's a little dirt? I completely understand. So tell me, what is it that gave you the courage to call me?"
11262,Rose, I wanted my freedom. I'm tired of running. You are in a position to accord me that?
11263,Elijah, I have complete authority to grant pardon to you and your little pet. What is his name these days? Trevor. If a saws fit it
11264,Rose, Katerina Petrova?
11265,Elijah, I'm listening 
11266,Rose, She didn't burn in the church in 1864
11267,Elijah, Continue
11268,Rose, She survived
11269,Elijah, Where is she?
11270,Rose, you don't seem surprise by this
11271,Elijah," Oh, when you called and invited me into this arm pities civilization, which at 3 hours from the town we know as Mystic Falls, I surmise it had everything to do with Katerina. Do you have her new position?"
11272,Rose, No but I have better. I have her doppelganger
11273,Elijah," That's impossible, her family line ended with her. I know that for fact"
11274,Rose, The facts are wrong
11275,Elijah," Well, show her to me"
11276,Rose," Elijah, you are a man of honor, you can be trusted but I want to hear you say it again"
11277,Elijah," You have my world, I will pardon you"
11278,Rose, Follow me
11279,Elijah, Human. It's impossible. Hello there
11280,Damon," The house should be behind those trees. Wait, I got a lot more experience than you do with those sorts of things"
11281,Stefan, What is your point?
11282,Damon," My point is, whoever has Elena is probably who was after Katherine in 1864 and before that"
11283,Stefan, And?
11284,Damon, And it puts them at 500 years old and strong. Are you sure you want to do this?
11285,Stefan," Yeah, I'm certain I want to do it"
11286,Damon," Because if we go in that house, we may not come back out"
11287,Stefan," Alright, then I won't come out"
11288,Damon," So noble, Stefan"
11289,Stefan," I can't think of a better reason to die but if you want to stay here, I totally understand"
11290,Elijah, We have a long journey head of us. We should be going
11291,Elena," Please, don't let him take me"
11292,Elijah, One last piece of business and we're done
11293,Trevor," I've waited so long for this day, Elijah. I'm truly, very sorry"
11294,Elijah," Oh no, your apologies are not necessary "
11295,Trevor," Yes, yes it is. You trusted me with Katerina and I failed you"
11296,Elijah, Oh yes you are the guilty one and Rose helped you because she was loyal to you and that now I honor. Where was your loyalty?
11297,Trevor, I beg your forgiveness
11298,Elijah, So granted
11299,Rose, You…!
11300,Elijah," Don't, Rose, now that you are free"
11301,Elijah, Come
11302,Elena, No and what about the moonstone?
11303,Elijah, What do you know about the moonstone?
11304,Elena, I know that you need it and I know where it is
11305,Elijah, Yes
11306,Elena, I can help you get it
11307,Elijah, Tell me where it is
11308,Elena, It doesn't work that way
11309,Elijah, Are you negotiating with me? 
11310,Rose, it's the first I heard of it
11311,Elijah, What is this vervein doing around here?
11312,Elijah, Tell me where the moonstone is
11313,Elena," In the tomb, underneath the church ruins"
11314,Elijah, What is it doing there?
11315,Elena, It's with Katherine
11316,Elijah, Interesting
11317,Elijah, What is that?
11318,Rose, I don't know
11319,Elijah, Who else is in this house?
11320,Rose, I don't know
11321,Elijah, Rose
11322,Rose, I don't know who it is
11323,Stefan, Up here
11324,Damon, Down here
11325,Elijah," Excuse me. To who may be concern, you're making a great mistake if you think that you can b*at me. You can't. Do you hear that?"
11326,Elijah," I repeat, you cannot b*at me. So I want the girl, I'm gonna count to 3 or heads will roll. Do we understand each other?"
11327,Elena," I'll come with you but just please don't my friends, they just wanted to help me out"
11328,Elijah, What game are you playing with me?
11329,Elena, Just let her go
11330,Stefan, Hey come here. Are you hurt? Are you okay?
11331,Jeremy, Elena?
11332,Jeremy, Are you okay?
11333,Elena, I'm okay. I'm okay
11334,Elena, I got your message
11335,Damon, Where is Elena?
11336,Stefan, She's home
11337,Damon, And you're here why?
11338,Stefan, Because she wanted to be with Jeremy
11339,Damon, Here
11340,Stefan," Thanks. Listen, what Rose told Elena about the curse…"
11341,Damon," I know, we'll keep her safe"
11342,Stefan," you know, the only way we're gonna be able to do that is if we're not fighting each other. We let Katherine come between us. If let that happen with Elena, we're not gonna be able to protect her"
11343,Damon," Yes Stefan, I heard it all before"
11344,Stefan, Hey
11345,Damon, What?
11346,Stefan, I'm sorry.
11347,Damon, About what?
11348,Stefan, For being the guy who made you turn 145 years ago
11349,Damon," Enough Stef, it's late. Don't need to rehearse that"
11350,Stefan, You know what? I've never said it at loud. I guess I just need to say it and you need to hear it. I'm sorry. What I did was selfish. I didn't want to be alone. I guess I just needed my brother
11351,Caroline," You know, this sounds crazy but alcohol helps or at least it helps me. You know, with all that inside jittery stuff"
11352,Tyler, I'm hot. It's like my skin is on fire
11353,Caroline," Really? I never had any of that. I guess wolves are different. At the beginning, I was very, very emotional. Everything was heightened "
11354,Tyler, I have that. How can you be a vampire?
11355,Caroline, How can you be a werewolf?
11356,Tyler, Who else is like you?
11357,Caroline, Just me. It's a very long story we can share another time. How many other werewolves are there?
11358,Tyler, Just me and my uncle Mason but he left town
11359,Caroline," Look, Tyler… You can't tell anyone, okay? Not about you, not about me. No one would understand"
11360,Tyler, I know
11361,Caroline," I want to tell you about my mom and yours and the founding families and the council but I need you to promise me no one will find out about us. This is life and death, Tyler"
11362,Tyler," I have no one else to tell. I'm sorry about earlier. It's just, I'm alone with this. It's gonna happen to me. In the next full moon, I' gonna turn and I won't be able to stop it. I'm scared"
11363,Caroline, Tyler…
11364,Stefan, Who's there?
11365,Rose, I'm not here to hurt you
11366,Stefan, Why are you here?
11367,Rose, Lexi once told me that you're one of the good ones
11368,Stefan, You knew Lexi?
11369,Rose, Trevor was my best friend. For 500 years I have lived with one person and he's gone and I don't want to run anymore because I don't have anywhere else to run to
11370,Stefan," Well, I'm sorry but I can't help you"
11371,Rose, I don't need your help but I think you need mine. Elijah may be dead but this isn't over
11372,Stefan," What do you mean ""it's not over""?"
11373,Rose," It isn't over. The originals, they'll come for her. They have to. They're doing it or him"
11374,Stefan, For whom?
11375,Rose, Klaus
11376,Damon, Cute pajies
11377,Elena," I'm tired, Damon"
11378,Damon, I brought you this
11379,Elena, I thought that was gone. Thank you
11380,Elena, Please give it back
11381,Damon, I just have to say something
11382,Elena, Why do you have to say it with my necklace? 
11383,Damon," Well, because what I'm about to say is… probably the most selfish thing I have ever said in my life"
11384,Elena," Damon, don't go there"
11385,Damon," No, I just have to say it once. You just need to hear it. I love you, Elena and it's because I love you that… I can't be selfish with you. Why you can't know this? I don't deserve you but my brother does"
11386,Damon," God, I wish you don't have to forget this but you do"
11387,Mother," A little more dearest, a little more "
11388,Mother, It's a girl
11389,Katherine," A girl. Please mother, let me see her"
11390,Father," Woman, don't! What are you doing?"
11391,Katherine, Let me at least hold her once… just once
11392,Father, Forget it! You have disgraced this family
11393,Katherine," Father, please! No, father, no!"
11394,Mother," No Katerina, it's better for her!"
11395,Katherine," No mother, please"
11396,Mother, Let her go… let her go Katerina 
11397,Katherine," Please, mama… "
11398,Damon," Hello, Elena"
11399,Elena, Stefan's here? He called. He said it was important
11400,Damon, Right this way
11401,Stefan, Hey
11402,Elena, What is this about?
11403,Elena, You
11404,Rose," Okay, you have to understand I only know what I've picked up over the years and I don't know what's true and what's not true. It's the problem with all this vampire crap but Klaus, I know he's real"
11405,Elena, Who is he?
11406,Damon," He's one of the originals, he's a legend"
11407,Stefan, from the first generation of vampires 
11408,Elena, Like Elijah 
11409,Rose, No. Elijah was the least of any compared to Klaus. He's a felsojah. Klaus is a real deal
11410,Stefan, Klaus is known to be the oldest 
11411,Elena," Okay, so you're saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?"
11412,Rose, Yes
11413,Stefan, No
11414,Damon," What they're saying is, I mean if what she's saying is true…"
11415,Rose, Which it is
11416,Damon, And you're saying it so I don't k*ll you
11417,Rose, Which I'm not
11418,Damon, Then we're looking at a solid maybe
11419,Stefan," Look, Elijah's dead, right? So no one else even know that you exist"
11420,Rose, Not that you know off
11421,Damon, That's not helping
11422,Stefan," Look, I've never even met anyone who's laid eyes on him. I mean, we're talking centuries of truth mixed with fiction. We don't know if he's real. For all we know he could just be some sort of stupid bed time stories "
11423,Rose," He's real and he doesn't give up. If he wants something, he gets it. If you're not afraid of Klaus, then you're an idiot"
11424,Damon," Aright, we're shaking. You made your point"
11425,Stefan, Where are you going?
11426,Elena, At school. I'm late 
11427,Stefan," Let me grab my stuff, I'll go with you"
11428,Elena," It's okay, I know where it is"
11429,Damon (to Rose), She's in denial
11430,Stefan," Shut up, Damon"
11431,Jeremy," Here, I got it"
11432,Bonnie, Thanks. Where is Elena?
11433,Jeremy," She's actually running late today. What are you doing later? You want to hang out at the grill, sh**t some pool? The winner owns the table"
11434,Bonnie," Uh, why?"
11435,Jeremy, What why?
11436,Bonnie," Well, you never asked me to play pool before so why know?"
11437,Jeremy," Uh, I don't know, I thought it'd be fun, never mind"
11438,Bonnie," No, hey, okay. Sure. It's just "
11439,Jeremy, Just what?
11440,Bonnie, It's just you're Elena's brother and… sure. It's just I'm really bad at pool
11441,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah. I thought you might be"
11442,Luka, Excuse me! Do you guys know which way is the office?
11443,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah. Through the double doors then straight ahead then quick left and then your first right. You must be new here "
11444,Luka," Yeah, I am. It's kind of hard to hide it. My name's Luka"
11445,Jeremy," I'm Jeremy, this is Bonnie"
11446,Luka," Hi, Bonnie"
11447,Jeremy," Anyway, Luka. I'm actually heading to that direction. Why you don't follow me? It can get confusing"
11448,Luka, Thanks man. It's nice to meet you Bonnie
11449,Elena, Tell everyone I wasn't feeling well and I went home instead of school
11450,Caroline, I can't believe I'm agreeing to this. I'm a terrible liar 
11451,Elena, And keep Stefan busy. I don't want him to know what I'm up to
11452,Caroline, I'm even worse at duplicity and you know this
11453,Elena, You managed to keep me occupied when Katherine paid Stefan a visit 
11454,Caroline," Yeah, because she threatened me. Not that I'm saying that you should use that as a tactic, it's… Stefan's gonna see right through me"
11455,Elena," Caroline, as my friend, do you promise or not?"
11456,Caroline, you had to break out the girlfriend code. Okay. I promise 
11457,Elena, Okay
11458,Caroline, Why don't you want Stefan to know?
11459,Elena, Because he would never be okay with me doing this
11460,Caroline, Are you sure you want to do this?
11461,Elena," Yes, I'm sure. She's the only one who knows the truth about Klaus. The only one who can tell me how to stop him"
11462,Caroline, But you're asking for the truth from someone who's probably never giving it. Are you sure about this?
11463,Elena," Yeah. I just can't stay back and wait. I have to know, Caroline. Please"
11464,Elena, Katherine?
11465,Elena, I'll be okay from here
11466,Katherine, Hello Elena. You come to watch me wither away? Goodbye Caroline
11467,Elena," As long as I stay on this side on the door, she can't hurt me. Please "
11468,Katherine, Stefan knows you're here?
11469,Elena, I brought you some things
11470,Katherine, You came to bribe me? What is it that you want?
11471,Elena, I want you to tell me about Klaus 
11472,Katherine," Hmm, you've been busy"
11473,Elena, I also brought you this
11474,Elena, It's your family history. It says in here that the family line ended with you. Obviously that's not true
11475,Katherine, You think that if you brought me some family keepsake then I'd open up?
11476,Elena, I also brought you this
11477,Elena," You don't look so good. How long before your body shuts down? 10, 20 years? It must be painful to desiccate and mummify. I can't even imagine"
11478,Katherine, You have the Petrova fire 
11479,Elena, More bl*od?
11480,Katherine," It's a long story, Klaus and i. it was all the way back to England, 1492, after I left Bulgaria or was thrown out"
11481,Elena, Thrown out?
11482,Katherine," My family, your true ancestors, they disowned me. My indiscretions were not tolerated at that time. I had a baby at a Winlock. A shame"
11483,Elena, It was kept secret?
11484,Katherine, Hum hum. My baby was given away. I was banished to England and I had to learn to adjust so I quickly became English. It was there that I caught the eye of a noble man name Klaus. I was taking with him at first until I found out what he was and what he wanted from me and then I ran like hell 
11485,Elijah," She's here. Katerina! I know you're near, I can smell your bl*od. It's pointless to run, Klaus will find you wherever you are"
11486,Trevor, This way. There is more bl*od over there
11487,Trevor, Head east. I can't distract them much longer
11488,Katherine, I can't run anymore
11489,Trevor, Never mind. There's a cottage. You'll be safe there. Go now. Go!
11490,Elena," So, what did Klaus want?"
11491,Katherine, The same thing that he wants from you. He wants to break the curse
11492,Elena, By sacrificing the Petrova doppelganger 
11493,Katherine, He wanted to drain every single drop of bl*od of my body
11494,Damon, Alright rosebud. I need some answers. Oh please don't tell me you're crying ‘cause your buddy Trevor lost his head
11495,Rose, You've always been this sensitive?
11496,Damon, Full vampire switch for this very reason. Takes the emotion out of it
11497,Rose," Yeah, you switch yours, I'll switch mine"
11498,Damon, Is that a dig?
11499,Rose, It's an observation. Being in love with your brother's girlfriend must be difficult
11500,Damon, I'm not in love with anyone
11501,Rose, You want to try that again?
11502,Damon, Don't get on my bad side
11503,Rose, Then show me your good side
11504,Damon, How do I find Klaus?
11505,Rose," You don't find Klaus, he finds you"
11506,Damon," Come on. Somebody's got to know somebody who knows where he is, right?"
11507,Rose, Add another two hundred somebodies to that and you're still not even close
11508,Damon," Humor me. You got in touch with Elijah, how did you do it?"
11509,Rose, Through a very low somebody on the churching poll. A guy name Slater in Richmond 
11510,Damon, Perfect. I'll drive
11511,Rose, No. You forget not all of us can do sun
11512,Damon, Then you drive. Come on
11513,Caroline, Stefan! 
11514,Stefan, Hey
11515,Caroline," Hey. Uh, I need to talk to you. Where are you going?"
11516,Stefan," Well, Elena went home sick; I just want to go check up on her"
11517,Caroline, Ditcher 
11518,Stefan, I'm kind of worried about her
11519,Caroline," You know what? Of course you are. Go ahead, I'd… you know what? We can talk later"
11520,Stefan," Uh, talk about what?"
11521,Caroline, I might have done something 
11522,Stefan, What did you do?
11523,Caroline, Told Tyler I'm a vampire 
11524,Elena, What does the Petrova bl*od line have to do with Klaus?
11525,Katherine, It's really tedious but…
11526,Katherine," The curse was bind by the sacrifice of Petrova bl*od. Witches are crafty with their spells. The doppelganger was created as a way to be able to undo the spell. Once the doppelganger reappeared, the curse can be broken"
11527,Elena, So you ran before he k*ll you
11528,Katherine, Something like that 
11529,Katherine," Help, please help me"
11530,Katherine," Please, help me"
11531,Woman, I don't invite strangers into my home
11532,Katherine," No, Trevor. He said that you'd help me"
11533,Rose, Damn him. Always making promises I don't want to keep
11534,Rose, Let the girl in
11535,Katherine, You must be Rose. Thank you. Trevor said to show you this
11536,Katherine, To prove I am who I say and that you'd help me to freedom
11537,Rose, You stole this from Klaus?
11538,Katherine," It was to be part of the sacrifice, so I grabbed it and made my escape"
11539,Rose, People do not escape from Klaus. Everyone who tries ends up back in his grass and anyone who helps them dies
11540,Katherine, I know the risk you bring on yourself by giving me aid 
11541,Rose," I'm risking nothing. At nightfall, I'll bring you back to Klaus and beg him to show us both mercy "
11542,Katherine, No! No!
11543,Damon, Back entrance. How convenient 
11544,Rose, That's the point. We can't all have little daylight rings
11545,Damon, How do you know this Slater guy is even here?
11546,Rose, I called him. He's here. He's always here
11547,Damon, Good
11548,Damon," Just one thing. If you're setting me up in any way, I will rip your heart out and shave it down your throat. It's something I'm very good at"
11549,Rose, I'm older than you and stronger. Don't get on my bad side
11550,Rose, You can trust me
11551,Damon, Whoa. What about the sunlight? 
11552,Rose, Double painted and temped. UV rays can't penetrate. You see the appeal know?
11553,Slater, That and the free Wi-Fi
11554,Rose," Hey, how are you?"
11555,Slater," Good. I saw you come, what are you doing here?"
11556,Rose," Mmm, it's a long story but I want you to meet…"
11557,Slater," Damon Salvatore. Turned 1864 in Mystic Falls by Katherine Pierce aka Katerina Petrova. So I take it I was right, what I told you about the tomb under the church was true?"
11558,Rose, Yes. It was right. Thank you for the tip 
11559,Slater," It's nice to meet you, maybe. What's going on Rose? Where is Trevor?"
11560,Elena," Rose never ended up taking you back to Klaus, did she?"
11561,Katherine, No but not because she had a change of heart 
11562,Rose, its nightfall. Time to go
11563,Rose, When did this happen?
11564,Katherine," In the woods, I tripped"
11565,Rose," It's a lie, I would have smelled it"
11566,Katherine," Rather die than go back to Klaus. Please, just let me die"
11567,Rose, If you die then Trevor dies with you
11568,Trevor, Where is she?
11569,Rose, You have set us both on the path of death. I only hope Klaus sees the honor in returning that girl to him 
11570,Trevor, He will sacrifice her
11571,Rose, Then sobiet! 
11572,Trevor," I love her, Rose"
11573,Rose, He'll k*ll you. He won't stop until he has our heads
11574,Trevor, Then we should run until we die 
11575,Elena, You k*ll yourself?!
11576,Katherine," Klaus needed a human doppelganger. As a vampire, I was no longer any use to him"
11577,Elena," But it didn't work. You didn't really escape, you've been running from Klaus ever since"
11578,Katherine, I under estimated his peered for vengeance but leaving with a suitcase is better than dying so you can have your bl*od spilled over some silly little rock
11579,Katherine," What's wrong? Afraid, right? You don't want to die? There's another way out"
11580,Katherine," Better hurry. Your opportunity is going, going, going and gone"
11581,Katherine, I made the other choice
11582,Trevor," What did you do, Katerina? I would have helped you live"
11583,Katherine, You would have helped me run. That was never going to be enough
11584,Trevor, It was enough for me
11585,Rose," Do you not see, Trevor? She used you to help her escape and me to turn her. Klaus will see our role in this"
11586,Katherine, And for that I'm sorry
11587,Rose, As am i…. for this
11588,Katherine, Please understand
11589,Rose, You just signed our death sentence 
11590,Katherine, Better you die than i 
11591,Elena, Rose and Trevor spent the last 500 years running because you used them. Trevor just got k*ll
11592,Katherine, I never thought he would last for that long
11593,Elena, You don't even care that you ruined their lives 
11594,Katherine," I was looking out for myself, Elena. I will always look out for myself. If you're smart, you'll do the same"
11595,Caroline," Sorry to drag you here but if I don't eat, I get these k*ll some people urge. Tyler totally has it too by the way"
11596,Stefan," Yeah, what else did you say to him?"
11597,Caroline, Not much. I was trying to keep the questions to a minimum. Are you mad?
11598,Stefan," Yes Caroline. As a matter of fact, i am a little mad. I mean, you put yourself a risk. If Damon finds out…"
11599,Caroline," But you're not gonna tell him, are you?"
11600,Stefan," No, of course not. He would k*ll you"
11601,Caroline, Always looking out for me
11602,Stefan," Yeah. Well, you don't exactly make it very easy on me"
11603,Caroline, Then why do you do it? Why are you such a good friend to me?
11604,Stefan," I don't know. I guess you… you remind me of someone. My best friend, Lexi"
11605,Caroline, I… you have a friend?
11606,Stefan," You say that with such a discouraging imam of surprise, Caroline"
11607,Caroline, No I just… sorry. I just… tell me about her
11608,Stefan," I will, some other time. I got to go"
11609,Caroline, Wait! No! What do we do about Tyler? I don't want Damon to k*ll him ‘cause there's a full moon coming up and Tyler is totally freaking out about it
11610,Luka, Hey Bonnie
11611,Bonnie," Hey, Luka. How was your first day?"
11612,Luka, It was great. I would like to introduce you to my dad
11613,Bonnie," Hi, I'm Bonnie Bennett"
11614,Jonas," Doctor Martin, Jonas Martin. It's nice to meet you Bonnie Bennett. Would you like to join us?"
11615,Bonnie," Oh, I'm meeting a friend but he's not here yet so… sure"
11616,Luka," Oh yes, please have a sit"
11617,Bonnie," So, where did you move from?"
11618,Jonas, Louisiana
11619,Bonnie, That's a big change
11620,Luka, I'll say
11621,Bonnie, It's not so bad here
11622,Luka, It's looking up
11623,Jonas," Bennett, uh? I knew some Bennett's when I did my residency in Massachusetts. Do you have any family from Salem?"
11624,Bonnie, Actually i do
11625,Jonas," What do you know? Small world, right?"
11626,Bonnie," Oh, there's me friend. It was nice to meet you, Doctor Martin"
11627,Luka, I will see you at school
11628,Bonnie, Yeah
11629,Jeremy," Sorry I was late, are you okay?"
11630,Bonnie, Yeah
11631,Slater, And you're sure Elijah's dead?
11632,Damon, Beyond dead
11633,Slater, Trevor was a good man; he helped me with my dissertation on sexual deviance on the baroque period. I was schooling for my psych PHT 
11634,Rose, Slater's been in college since 74
11635,Slater," When i was turned. I have 18 degrees, 3 masters and 4 PHT "
11636,Damon, The point?
11637,Slater," Exactly, I mean, what is the point? What should I be doing with my eternity? If you have an answer, please enlight me "
11638,Rose," We need your help. If someone wanted to get in touch with Klaus, how would you hook him up?"
11639,Slater, Craigslist
11640,Damon, Really?
11641,Slater," Seriously. I respond to a personal add to get set to somebody who knows somebody who knows Elijah, who's dead and that's where my connection ends"
11642,Jeremy, You are bad
11643,Bonnie, I told you
11644,Jeremy," Well, you can cheat if you need your dignity back"
11645,Bonnie," Come on, hit the ball"
11646,Luka," Alright, I got winner guys. I got winner"
11647,Jeremy," Get ready, this slot is almost over"
11648,Bonnie, So where's your dad?
11649,Luka, I'll see him back home
11650,Stefan," Okay, now I'm leaving"
11651,Caroline, Wait…!
11652,Stefan," No, no, no, Caroline, you have two seconds to come clean"
11653,Caroline, What do you mean?
11654,Stefan, I'd believe your whole innocent act a little bit better if I didn't know how good you are at providing a distraction on demand. Where is Elena?
11655,Caroline, I can't tell you
11656,Stefan, You can't tell me? Are you kidding me?
11657,Caroline, I'm sorry but i… I can't tell you
11658,Stefan," Caroline! Elena was kidnapped, she could have been k*ll and you're seriously not gonna tell me where she is?"
11659,Caroline, She's not in any danger. I would not have let her put herself in danger
11660,Stefan, Put herself in danger where? What do you…? She's with Damon isn't she?
11661,Caroline," Ouh, no"
11662,Stefan," Then where… where is she? Listen, if you're my friend like you've been pretending to be all day, then you'll tell me where she is"
11663,Caroline," Stefan, I am your friend but I'm also Elena's friend and I'm sorry but I'm not going to tell you where she is"
11664,Elena, So how much of your little story is true?
11665,Katherine," I have no reason to lie, Elena. I have no reason to do anything but sit here and read and rot"
11666,Elena," Okay, assuming it's even partially true, that's the reason why you came back isn't it? Because you wanted to be the one to hand me over to Klaus"
11667,Katherine," 500 years in the run, I figured maybe he'd be willing to strike a deal"
11668,Elena, So you got Mason Lockwood to find you the moonstone
11669,Katherine, Right again
11670,Elena, What else do you needed to break the curse?
11671,Katherine," Hmm, look who is getting smarter"
11672,Elena," It's not just me or the stone, is it? Otherwise that you'd be no reason to trigger Tyler Lockwood's werewolf curse"
11673,Katherine," Witches and their spells: so many ingredients, so many people to sacrifice"
11674,Elena, So you need a werewolf
11675,Katherine," Believe it or not, they're hard to come by"
11676,Elena, What else?
11677,Katherine, A witch to do the spell. Mine bailed but Bonnie will do just fine
11678,Elena, What else?
11679,Katherine, A vampire
11680,Elena, Caroline
11681,Katherine, It could have been anyone I suppose but i like the poetry of Caroline
11682,Elena, So you were gonna just hand us all over to be k*ll?
11683,Katherine, Better you die than i 
11684,Damon," Here's what I don't get: Elijah moved around during the day, which means the original people knew the secret of the day ring. Know why would Klaus want to lift the curse of the sun and the moon?"
11685,Slater, To keep the werewolves from lifting it. If a vampire breaks the sun curse then the werewolves are stuck with the curse of the moon forever and vice versa
11686,Rose, But werewolves are extinct
11687,Slater, True. I've never seen one but rumor has it
11688,Damon, Not such a rumor 
11689,Slater," Mystic Falls? God, I got to visit this place. It sounds awesome"
11690,Damon, Can we stop the curse from being broken at all?
11691,Slater, What do you mean?
11692,Damon," Well, if we make the moonstone useless, would it stop the curse from being broken?"
11693,Slater," Yeah, probably but why would you want to do that?"
11694,Damon, Tell me how
11695,Slater, You think I'm gonna help you figure out how to do something that will piss of an original? And keeping them from walking in the sun?
11696,Damon, You want to walk in the sun? I can make that happen if you help us
11697,Damon, You're gonna be okay
11698,Rose, I know
11699,Damon, Who's behind that?
11700,Rose, I don't know. Where is Slater?
11701,Damon, Iowa by now. Who the hell knows?
11702,Rose," He's not behind this, he's a good guy, he wouldn't betrayed me"
11703,Damon, Who did it?
11704,Rose," It's Klaus, don't you understand? You don't know this man, we're dead, we're all dead"
11705,Luka," Hey Bonnie. I'm sorry about earlier, my dad is not very subtle with the whole Bennett/Salem question. He picked up on you, he was just fishing around, he didn't mean any harm "
11706,Bonnie, I felt something too
11707,Luka, I know. That's why we're having this conversation right now. He uh… doesn't like for anyone to know
11708,Luka, But we were both worry that you would bail us
11709,Luka," He just wants us to fit in here for once. It's tough Bonnie, being different "
11710,Bonnie, You're a witch?
11711,Luka, We prefer the term warlock 
11712,Stefan, Elena
11713,Elena," Stefan, what are you doing here?"
11714,Stefan, I could ask you the same question
11715,Elena, Caroline told you
11716,Stefan," No, she kept your secret but it didn't take long for me to figure out what was the important that you'd have to keep it from me"
11717,Elena, I knew that you'd stop me
11718,Stefan," Listen to me, whatever she said to you is a lie. Do not listen to her. She's a liar, Elena"
11719,Elena, What if she isn't? You didn't hear what she said
11720,Stefan," You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you"
11721,Elena," That's the problem, you won't but you'll die trying. How's that any better?"
11722,Katherine," There's nothing you can do, Stefan. I haven't even told you the best part of the story"
11723,Katherine," No, no, no mama. No!"
11724,Katherine," He k*ll them, my entire family just to get back at me for running. Whatever you do to escape Klaus, he will get his vengeance on your friends, your family and anyone that you've ever loved "
11725,Stefan," No, look at me. No, do not listen to her, okay?"
11726,Katherine, Always the protector but you must realize that she's doomed. There's nothing you can do to stop it unless of course you have this
11727,Elena, What?
11728,Stefan," Oh no, there it is. It's the ultimate lie, isn't it? You spun this whole thing so that we would have to get the stone from you, didn't you? "
11729,Katherine," I didn't spin anything, Stefan. It's the truth"
11730,Stefan," No, let me guess. You want to trade that stone for your freedom, you manipulative, psychotic bitch"
11731,Katherine," My freedom? That's where you're wrong, Stefan. I don't want my freedom because when Klaus shows up to k*ll us all and he will, I'll be in the tomb, where no vampire will enter because they can't get out. I'll be the safest psychotic bitch in town"
11732,Rose, I'm sorry about today. I didn't know that was gonna happen 
11733,Damon, I believe you
11734,Rose, I wish we could save Elena. I know that you want to
11735,Damon, And I will
11736,Rose, You remind me of Trevor
11737,Damon, Why? Why him?
11738,Rose," Because he always talked big game, always working on angle but underneath all this, he was the best friend anyone could hope for"
11739,Damon, And where did that get him?
11740,Rose, Dead and my loyalty to him almost got me dead too
11741,Damon, To friendship 
11742,Rose," You're right to fight it, how do you feel about her"
11743,Damon, And why's that?
11744,Rose," Because if you want to survive, you need to not care about anyone"
11745,Damon," Caring get you dead, uh?"
11746,Rose, He might just be time to turn the switch off on your emotions
11747,Damon, I will if you will
11748,Stefan, Elena
11749,Elena," I can't talk about it, Stefan"
11750,Stefan," You have to. Don't shut me out. Elena, please"
11751,Elena," I wanted to know the truth, Stefan and I got it. It's not just me that's in danger. It's Caroline and it's Tyler and its Bonnie. They're all part of breaking the curse. I can't blame anyone else anymore because it's not because you came into town or because you and i fell in love. That's not why everyone that I love is in danger. It's because of me, everything is because of me"
11752,Rose," It's a lie, you know. There's no switch you can turn. Sure when you're a newbie but after a couple of hundred years… you just have to pretend"
11753,Rose, Hello?
11754,Slater, Rose?
11755,Rose, Slater? Are you okay?
11756,Slater," Yes, I took off, I'm sorry, I was freaking freaked"
11757,Rose," No, I'm sorry to involved you"
11758,Slater," Look, i want no part in any of this but i did some digging"
11759,Rose," Okay, what did you find?"
11760,Slater, You can destroy the curse but you need the moonstone
11761,Rose, How? What do you mean? I don't follow
11762,Slater, Can your friend get the moonstone? You need it
11763,Rose," Yes, he can get it. What next?"
11764,Slater," You need a witch. Get the moonstone, a witch should be able to figure out the rest. Good luck, Rose"
11765,Elijah, Very nicely done
11766,Slater," Thanks, I have a degree in theatre. How can you compel me? A vampire can't compel another vampire"
11767,Elijah, I'm a special vampire
11768,Slater," What, because you're an original?"
11769,Elijah," Hmm, now I want you this and drive it through your heart"
11770,Slater, But that will k*ll me forever
11771,Elijah, I know
11772,Elijah, But it's necessary
11773,Jonas," Was it, really?"
11774,Elijah, It had to be done. He delivered his message. Won't be long now
11775,Alaric, Elena
11776,Elena, I heard something
11777,Jenna, That was us. I'm sorry
11778,Alaric," Well, I'm naked so I'm gonna go"
11779,Jenna, I'm really really sorry
11780,Elena," It's okay, Jenna. Don't worry about it"
11781,Jenna, I know he's been staying over a lot. Are you sure it's okay?
11782,Elena, Seems like things are good
11783,Jenna, They are extremely good
11784,Elena, Then I'm extremely okay with that
11785,Damon, Let's to it
11786,Stefan," Hey, can we talk?"
11787,Elena, Why?
11788,Damon, We went to see Katherine
11789,Elena, Come on in
11790,Katherine," Please, come on in. There's many room for all of us"
11791,Damon, I rather poke my eyes out
11792,Katherine," Hmm, there are such pretty eyes"
11793,Stefan, We're here for the moonstone
11794,Damon, Feel like tossing it over?
11795,Katherine," Tell you what, you get a little witch to hocus pocus me out of here and you get whatever you want"
11796,Stefan, I thought you liked it in here. Nice and safe where Klaus can't get to you
11797,Katherine, I've time to reconsider
11798,Damon, Meaning you're hungry
11799,Katherine," I'm starving, Damon and dirty but above all, I'm bored. At least running from Klaus was not boring so here the deal: you get me out of here, you get the moonstone and I'll disappear from Mystic Falls forever. Let me know what you decide"
11800,Elena," You don't believe her, do you?"
11801,Damon," No, of course not. We just want the moonstone"
11802,Stefan," According to Rose's friend Slater, there's the way to destroy the spell that Klaus wants to break"
11803,Damon," No spell, no doppelganger sacrifice so ergo you live"
11804,Elena, How do you destroy it?
11805,Stefan, By releasing it from the moonstone
11806,Elena, How do you guys even know this is gonna work?
11807,Damon, ‘cause we have a crafty witch on our side
11808,Elena, You discussed with Bonnie
11809,Stefan, She agreed to do anything she could to help us
11810,Elena, It's Katherine who has the moonstone. She's not gonna give it to you
11811,Stefan, We're gonna get it from her
11812,Damon," Well, what he means to say is we will pray for her cold dead head if we have to"
11813,Stefan," Bonnie just needs to find a way to release the seal long enough for us to get in, get the moonstone and get out in time for her to return it"
11814,Elena," Whoa, seems like you guys have already all planned out"
11815,Damon," Yep, we're awesome"
11816,Elena, Except for one thing. I don't want you to do it
11817,Stefan," What are you talking about? Elena, we don't have a choice"
11818,Elena, What about Klaus?
11819,Stefan, We'll find him right after we get the moonstone
11820,Elena," Is that before or after that he k*ll everyone that I care about, including the two of you"
11821,Stefan," Elena, if we can dispel the moonstone, we can save your life"
11822,Elena," I know, everybody keeps saying that"
11823,Luka, So your grams waited you were in high school to tell you that you're a witch?
11824,Bonnie," She brought it up before but I just thought she was drunk. In my defense, she was"
11825,Luka, So then you're like new
11826,Bonnie, Newish. I still have some growing pains
11827,Luka, Like?
11828,Bonnie, Physically it's becoming a lot harder. I have a bad reaction to it sometimes
11829,Luka, Your noise bleeds?
11830,Bonnie, Yeah and I pass out sometimes
11831,Luka, It's because you're trying to do too much on your own. You need help
11832,Bonnie, From what?
11833,Luka," From nature, the elements. Just things you could dry your power from. Do you have channel to another witch before?"
11834,Bonnie, What is that?
11835,Luka, Say we put our energy together and we can double our strength. I'll show you. Let me see that bracelet
11836,Luka, I want you to stand very still and concentrate
11837,Bonnie, I don't get it
11838,Luka, I know
11839,Bonnie, What are we doing?
11840,Luka, We're channeling. They're personal idioms we activate as talisman. Now concentrate
11841,Bonnie, What is that?
11842,Jeremy," What's with that weather, uh?"
11843,Luka, It's global warming man. I don't know. I got to go. See you later Bonnie
11844,Bonnie, Bye Luka
11845,Luka, Bye
11846,Jeremy," The guy is weird, uh?"
11847,Bonnie, No he's not
11848,Jeremy, What is it?
11849,Bonnie, It's Damon
11850,Rose, It's not nice to leave a girl naked so early in the morning
11851,Rose," Sorry, I thought you were…"
11852,Elena, I… sorry. I…
11853,Rose, There is no one else here
11854,Elena, Actually I came to talk to you
11855,Rose, Then I should probably get dressed
11856,Rose, It's a bad idea
11857,Elena," No, it's not. From what Stefan told me your friend Slater obviously has more information about Klaus. You and Damon just gave up before you got it"
11858,Rose, Because somebody blew up a coffee shop with us in it
11859,Elena, There's more to learn. We just have to find a way to learn it
11860,Rose, Why are you coming to me with this?
11861,Elena, Because you owe me. One word from me and Damon Stefan could have k*ll you for kidnapping me
11862,Rose, Or maybe it's because you know that they wouldn't want you doing this
11863,Elena," We're having a disagreement, okay? They're willing to risk everyone that i love and I'm not"
11864,Rose, They're just trying to protect you
11865,Elena, And you've proven you couldn't care less whether I'm protected or not so we're back to you taking me to Slater
11866,Rose, What exactly do you hope to achieve by this?
11867,Elena, How would you like to be able to walk during the daylight?
11868,Rose," I've been the slave to shadows for 500 years, what do you think?"
11869,Elena, I think I know a witch who's willing to do whatever it takes to help if you're willing to make a deal
11870,Matt," Hey man, how are you doing?"
11871,Tyler, Good and you?
11872,Matt," I pissed myself for picking a fight with you and I'm feeling guilty for what happened to Sarah. I mean, I've been dodging you for days because I didn't know what to say to you"
11873,Tyler, Don't worry
11874,Matt, I'm really sorry. Please know that
11875,Caroline, Matt
11876,Matt, Hey
11877,Caroline, How are you?
11878,Matt, I've been better. I got to get to class
11879,Caroline, Okay
11880,Tyler, You two still on the outs?
11881,Caroline, Looks like it. You realize there is almost a full moon?
11882,Tyler, Vampires don't have enough problems? You want to take on mine?
11883,Caroline, Have you thought about it? The whole wolf thing? Do you know what you're gonna do?
11884,Tyler, I have a plan
11885,Caroline, Well…
11886,Tyler, Kind of private
11887,Caroline," I headed the prom comity, not to mention I single handedly organized this town cleanup campaign and you're really gonna turned out my help?"
11888,Bonnie, I might be able to lower the tomb spell long enough for you to get in there and grab the moonstone from Katherine
11889,Jeremy, How? It took both you and your grams last time and look what happened to her
11890,Bonnie, I'm aware of what happened. I've learn a few new things
11891,Jeremy, Bonnie…
11892,Bonnie, How will you get it?
11893,Stefan," She hasn't been feeding. She's weaker, we're not"
11894,Bonnie," You wouldn't be underestimating her, do you?"
11895,Stefan, It's a plan. Is it perfect? What plan is?
11896,Jeremy," Let me do it. I've got my ring, I could get in, get out and no spell necessary"
11897,Damon, Jeez thank you 16 years old child. Why didn't we think about that? Why are you even here?
11898,Bonnie, Maybe I can help better the plan. Do you have anything that belongs to Katherine?
11899,Rose," Slater? Slater, it's Rose. Open up!"
11900,Rose," He's not home, sorry"
11901,Elena, uh uh. We didn't come all the way out of here for nothing
11902,Rose, Off to you
11903,Rose, Slater?
11904,Rose, I don't think he's gonna be much help
11905,Elena, Looks like whoever blew up the coffee shop found him and k*ll him for his information
11906,Rose," Yeah, probably for helping people like us. The guy was a vampire omeneck. Knowing too much information just b*at him in the ass"
11907,Elena, What are you…?
11908,Rose," tempted glass, UV rays can't penetrate"
11909,Rose, I used to just come here and watch the day
11910,Elena, I'm sorry about Slater
11911,Rose, Any luck?
11912,Elena," its password protected, I can't get in"
11913,Rose," Then this is pointless, let's just go"
11914,Rose, Stay here
11915,Rose, Alice?
11916,Alice, Rose
11917,Stefan, This belonged to Katherine. I found it with her things after I thought she was dead but it was hers
11918,Damon, What was this?
11919,Bonnie," I can turn the metal into ash, blew the ashes on her and it will incapacitate her for a minute or two. Long enough for you to get the stone and get out"
11920,Tyler, Matt takes it pretty hard
11921,Caroline, I know. It's better this way
11922,Tyler, I get it
11923,Caroline, You do?
11924,Tyler, Yeah. You can't be honest with him. It's not really fair to be with someone not really let them know who you are. I get it
11925,Tyler, Right over here. There's a cellar that goes to our old property
11926,Caroline, I know
11927,Tyler, You do?
11928,Caroline, I know that this is the old Lockwood property
11929,Tyler, Watch your step
11930,Tyler, I'm guessing that's where Mason was headed the night he turned. It's this way
11931,Caroline, Did Mason tell you about this place?
11932,Tyler, Mason bolted before I trigger the curse but I found these
11933,Caroline, Look old
11934,Tyler, And these bolt and chains. I need new chains but the bolt can still hold
11935,Tyler, I think that's what this place was use for. Full moons
11936,Caroline, What's this?
11937,Caroline, Was it Mason's?
11938,Tyler," ""August 31. My body is changing. I'm edgy, angry and impatient. I get some black out, I forget what I say or do. I'm not myself. Not since Jimmy's death. What's happening to me? "
11939,Tyler," He chronicled everything. ""The full moon is tonight"""
11940,Caroline, Does he say what happened?
11941,Stefan, We should get the torches
11942,Damon, Alaric's stakes are in my trunk. Bonnie?
11943,Bonnie, Go ahead. I'm almost done
11944,Jeremy, What are you doing? You're not strong enough
11945,Bonnie, I'll be fine
11946,Jeremy, You could get hurt
11947,Bonnie, and Elena could die. I'll be fine. I promise
11948,Jeremy," I got this okay? Go get me something to put this in, alright?"
11949,Rose, She found him a few minutes before we did
11950,Elena, How is she?
11951,Rose, Overreacting. Big time
11952,Elena, Her boyfriend just died. There's no such thing as overreacting
11953,Rose, The tears are for her. She didn't care of Slater. She was only dating him long enough to see if he'll turn her
11954,Alice, Thank you
11955,Alice, You look really familiar. Did you know Slater?
11956,Elena," Not personally, no. I just knew that he kept detail records of all of his vampire's contacts and I was hoping that he could point me towards Klaus"
11957,Alice, Doubtful. Klaus doesn't want to be pointed out
11958,Elena, Do you know Slater's computer password?
11959,Alice, Are you seriously asking me that right now? I just saw my boyfriend with a stake through his heart
11960,Elena, I understand that. Do you know his password?
11961,Alice, Who do you think you are?
11962,Elena, What if I could convince Rose to turn you?
11963,Elena, Will you show us his files then?
11964,Alice, Someone's been here. The hard disc is completely wiped out
11965,Rose, Probably by the one who k*ll him
11966,Alice," Lucky for you, Slater was paranoid. Everything's backed up on a mode server"
11967,Rose," You know that she's not going anywhere near of my bl*od, right?"
11968,Elena, I know but she doesn't
11969,Alice," Kristen Stewart. God, was it obvious?"
11970,Elena, These are all leads to vampires?
11971,Alice, Slater was obsessed. Almost as much as me
11972,Rose, What about that one: Cody Webber? They exchanged dozens of emails about Elijah
11973,Alice, I could call him
11974,Elena, Tell him that we're trying to send a message to Klaus: the doppelganger is alive and she's ready to surrender
11975,Rose, What?!
11976,Alice, Oh my god! I knew I recognized you
11977,Elena, Get him the message please
11978,Rose, What are you doing?
11979,Elena, I'm getting Klaus's attention
11980,Rose," If Klaus knows that you're alive, he'll find you and he'll k*ll you"
11981,Rose, Which is exactly what you wanted all along
11982,Elena, It's either me or my family
11983,Rose, So all of this is a su1c1de mission so that you could sacrifice yourself and save everyone else?
11984,Alice, Cody is on his way and he really wants to meet you
11985,Katherine, The youngest Gilbert. This is an intriguing surprise
11986,Jeremy, I'm here for the moonstone
11987,Katherine," Yeah, the stone. It's very popular today"
11988,Jeremy, Just give it to me
11989,Katherine," Naïve little Gilbert. If you want it, you're gonna have to come here and get it"
11990,Jeremy, I kind of figured you'd say that 
11991,Jeremy," Come on, where is it?"
11992,Bonnie, Sorry I'm late. I degrabed the grimoire from home
11993,Damon," Jeremy couldn't take the pressure, uh?"
11994,Bonnie, He said he'd be here
11995,Damon, Not a good time Rose
11996,Rose, Don't be angry with me
11997,Damon," Why, what did you do?"
11998,Rose, You need to get to Richmond immediately
11999,Damon, Tell me
12000,Stefan, What the hell?
12001,Bonnie, Is it the moonstone?
12002,Katherine, I hate to interrupt but today have been full of surprises
12003,Jeremy, I'm sorry. I took some powder
12004,Katherine," Don't worry, I know that he's wearing his ring so no matter how many times I k*ll him, he'll just be coming back for more. So, I'm gonna be in the back playing with my new little toy and you guys just give me a howl when you got the tomb open"
12005,Elijah, So how exactly does the spell work?
12006,Jonas, Give me your hand
12007,Jonas, Place it here
12008,Jonas, Now take my hand
12009,Jonas," Close your eyes, relax your mind and look for her"
12010,Jonas," You saw her, didn't you?"
12011,Elijah, I know exactly where she is
12012,Stefan, Where the hell is Damon?
12013,Bonnie, We can't wait; we have to get him out of there
12014,Stefan," She's fed, she has her strength back"
12015,Bonnie, We still have what's left of the ash. Do you think you can get close enough?
12016,Stefan, I don't have a choice
12017,Bonnie, It's gonna take me some time
12018,Stefan, How long?
12019,Bonnie," I don't know, a while"
12020,Stefan, Just get me in there as soon as you can
12021,Jonas, So how was school?
12022,Luka, Revealing
12023,Jonas, What's wrong?
12024,Luka, Nothing
12025,Mason," ""September 15, 2 hours from the first full moon since I triggered the curse"""
12026,Tyler, He tapped his first transformation
12027,Caroline, There's nothing… September 16. He wrote about everything the next day
12028,Caroline," ""I chose the garage. I could double the door. It was far from the street so no one could hear. I bolted hooks to the floor for the carabineers"". Like for mountain climbing?"
12029,Tyler, Retractable cables
12030,Caroline," It's wolfs pain. ""I dilated wolfs pain with water to weaken myself but I could barely get it down without plucking. It felt like I was drinking battery acid. Over an hour passed and nothing happened. It got do quiet I could hear my own bl*od pumping and that's when…"""
12031,Caroline," ""I kept thinking at black out and not feel it but I did. I felt all of it"""
12032,Caroline, How long is it?
12033,Tyler, 3 hours in
12034,Tyler, 4 hours
12035,Tyler, 5 hours. How long this is last?
12036,Tyler," I can't. I can't do that. Caroline, whatever that was, I can't go through that"
12037,Damon, What are you doing here?
12038,Elena, What are you doing here?
12039,Elena, You called him?
12040,Rose," I'm sorry, Elena."
12041,Elena, You said that you understood
12042,Damon, She lied
12043,Alice, Damon Salvatore
12044,Damon, Get rid of her
12045,Alice, No way
12046,Damon," Come on, we're living"
12047,Elena, No
12048,Damon, I said we're living
12049,Elena, I'm not going with you
12050,Damon, You do not get to make decisions anymore
12051,Elena," When have I ever made a decision? You and Stefan do that for me but this, this is my decision"
12052,Damon, Whose gonna save your life while you're making decisions?
12053,Elena," You're not listening to me, Damon. I don't want to be saved. Not if it means that Klaus is gonna k*ll every single person that I love"
12054,Damon, Get your ass out the door before I through you over my shoulder and carry you out myself
12055,Damon, Don't ever do that again
12056,Katherine," Hmm, something's happening"
12057,Jeremy," Bonnie no! You have to stop her, she's not strong enough!"
12058,Katherine, Maybe she is
12059,Jonas, What's going on?
12060,Luka, It's Bonnie Bennett. She's channeling me
12061,Jonas, Why would you let her do that?
12062,Luka, You told me to bond with her so I bounded
12063,Stefan," Bonnie, Bonnie"
12064,Jeremy, You got to stop her
12065,Stefan, You need to stop. Bonnie!
12066,Jonas, Luka!
12067,Stefan, Bonnie!
12068,Stefan," Bonnie, Bonnie wake up please"
12069,Katherine, Yes please because I'm still in here!
12070,Stefan, Are you okay?
12071,Bonnie, It didn't work. I'm not strong enough. Even with help I can't do it
12072,Katherine," That's too bad, I'm still hungry"
12073,Caroline, You know what? I don't think we should read this anymore
12074,Tyler, Why? What did you read?
12075,Caroline," There's a… reason that's called a curse, Tyler"
12076,Tyler," ""Inimagible pain, I thought it would never end, it was the worse night of my life"""
12077,Caroline, But… he did say that the transformation speeds up over time. So if you could just get through this first time then…
12078,Tyler, Why are you helping me?
12079,Caroline, What do you mean?
12080,Tyler, Why do you care? You've never been friends before
12081,Caroline," It's not true. I've known you my entire life, Tyler"
12082,Tyler, We've never been close. Not like this
12083,Caroline, I don't know. You just seem like you… like you kind of need it
12084,Caroline, I was alone when I turned. I had no control over my body or my urges and… I k*ll somebody. I don't want that to happen to you. I don't want you to be alone
12085,Caroline, Matt…
12086,Matt," I know I should have called, I'm sorry"
12087,Caroline, What are you doing here?
12088,Matt, I don't know but I was driving home from work and just kind of found myself here
12089,Caroline, Are you okay? I've been worried about you
12090,Matt, I miss you
12091,Matt, Hey
12092,Tyler, Hey
12093,Damon, Time to go. Alice is sleeping and won't remember a moment of this horrible stupid day
12094,Cody, We're here to meet the doppelganger
12095,Elena, Thank you for coming
12096,Damon, I will break your arm
12097,Damon, There is nothing here for you
12098,Damon, I k*ll you. You were dead
12099,Elijah, For centuries now 
12100,Elijah, Who are you?
12101,Cody, Who are you?
12102,Elijah, I'm Elijah
12103,Cody, We were gonna bring her to you for Klaus. She's the doppelganger. I don't know how she exists but she does. Klaus would want to see her
12104,Elijah, Does anyone else know that you're here?
12105,Cody, No
12106,Elijah," Well, then you have been incredibly helpful"
12107,Elijah, Where is Luka?
12108,Jonas, Asleep
12109,Elijah, Your shadow spell was successful. I was able to track that girl. However I did have a little running with one of the brothers that k*ll me
12110,Jonas, I assume he didn't live to tell about it
12111,Elijah," Actually I spared him. He'd die before he let anything happen to her, they both would. She'll be kept safe"
12112,Jonas, For now
12113,Elijah, That's precisely where we need her to be. Safe 
12114,Jeremy," I'm home, okay? I don't need an escort to my room"
12115,Bonnie, I don't know. Between here and upstairs there's still time for you to do something stupid
12116,Jeremy, I already feel bad. I don't need you to bread me
12117,Bonnie, Stefan is stuck in there and I don't know how to get him out. What should I be doing?
12118,Jeremy, You should admit that you never should have try this in the first place
12119,Bonnie," I didn't have a choice, Jeremy!"
12120,Jeremy," Yeah, neither did i"
12121,Bonnie, Why did you have to get involve?
12122,Jeremy, Because I didn't want you to get hurt
12123,Bonnie, Look Jeremy… you can't feel that way about me
12124,Jeremy, Don't
12125,Bonnie, What?
12126,Jeremy, Don't act like this is one side and like I'm some kid that has a crush on his sister's friend. You could have died today
12127,Bonnie, And you almost did
12128,Jeremy, That was a chance I'm willing to take
12129,Bonnie, I can't… I can't. I'm sorry
12130,Jeremy, Yeah…
12131,Elena, Thank you for bringing me home
12132,Damon," Well, you ride left you. I didn't want to leave you stranded"
12133,Elena, She was just scared. She didn't mean to run
12134,Damon, Yes she did. She's been running for 500 years
12135,Elena, I can't believe Elijah is alive. Why do you think he k*ll those two vampires and just let us go?
12136,Damon, if I had a dollar for every time some evil vampire surprises me…
12137,Damon, What you did today was incredibly stupid
12138,Elena," Actually the only thing that was stupid was that I got caught. I don't question why you and Stefan and everyone else try so hard to save me. You shouldn't question why i would try to save all of you. Damon, good night, okay?"
12139,Damon, What?
12140,Jeremy, it's Stefan
12141,Elena, Stefan! Stefan!
12142,Damon, don't you dare
12143,Elena," Stefan's in here, Damon! How could you let this happen?"
12144,Damon, What are you talking about? I was too busy saving you from your crazy kamikaze mission
12145,Elena, You didn't have to go after the moonstone in the first place!
12146,Damon," It was the right call, Elena!"
12147,Elena," The right call? How would any of this be the right call? Damon, let go of me! Let go of me!"
12148,Elena, Please
12149,Damon, Are you done?
12150,Damon, Of all idiots plan… I'll find a way to get you out
12151,Stefan, No it's alright. I'll head myself. Bonnie has the moonstone. Work with her. Try to figure out how to dispel it 
12152,Damon, You martyr yourself into a tomb and I got to partner with a semi competent witch? Wonderful
12153,Stefan, Keep Elena away from here
12154,Damon, Yeah ‘cause that will be easy…
12155,Stefan," Promise me. No matter what happens, you'll protect her"
12156,Damon, I promise
12157,Katherine, That right there was the biggest mistake you've ever made
12158,Tyler," Mason, it's Tyler again. Look, your voicemail is full. I need to talk to you. It's a full moon tomorrow and… I found your recording and I'm freeking out over here. Just call me back, please"
12159,Elena," Now that you've got this back, what are you gonna do with it?"
12160,Bonnie," Right now it's what is binding the sun and the moon curse. If i can figure out a way to remove the spell from the stone, the stone becomes useless"
12161,Elena," And according to Katherine, Klaus becomes vengeful"
12162,Bonnie, Maybe if he finds out
12163,Elena," Bonnie, can't this wait? Stefan is stuck in the tomb with Katherine. We've got to get him out"
12164,Bonnie, Stefan wants me to focus on this
12165,Elena, Don't listen to him. He thinks that he's protecting me but he's wrong
12166,Bonnie, I'm taking Stefan's side with this one. We're not gonna let you get use in some creepy sacrifice ritual
12167,Jeremy, What are you guys arguing about? 
12168,Bonnie, We're not arguing anything
12169,Bonnie, I need a coffee
12170,Elena, What?
12171,Jeremy, Why are you on some su1c1de mission?
12172,Elena, I'm trying to prevent everyone else from getting hurt
12173,Jeremy, How's bringing Klaus the moonstone so you can get yourself k*ll is okay?
12174,Bonnie, Where are you going?
12175,Elena, To see Stefan
12176,Bonnie, You're lying
12177,Elena," No, I'm not"
12178,Bonnie, Really? Tire your face
12179,Elena, Are you serious?
12180,Jeremy, She took the moonstone
12181,Elena, How did you…?
12182,Bonnie, We tested you and you failed
12183,Elena, Klaus k*ll Katherine's entire family just because she crossed him. I can't let that happen
12184,Elena, What did you do?
12185,Stefan, You trapped her in the house?
12186,Damon, It's for the best. Trust me. Elena is on a martyr that rivals your greatest hits. You should be glad the witch and i are getting along. I brought you this
12187,Damon," Care package: candles, lanterns and lunch"
12188,Stefan, Give that to me and I'm just gonna have to share with her
12189,Damon, Yeah…
12190,Katherine, You two are surprisingly calm considering Klaus will haunt you down and k*ll you if you mess with his little plan
12191,Damon, I've been dead before. I got over it
12192,Damon," Once we deal with this moonstone, we'll figure a way to get you out"
12193,Stefan, Don't worry about me. Just make sure Elena's safe
12194,Carol, Heading out?
12195,Tyler," Yeah… lunch at the grill, I've got practice and I'll probably go out after. I'll be late"
12196,Jules, Hi
12197,Tyler, Hi
12198,Jules," Sorry. Rude. You have no idea who i am. I'm Jules, a friend of Mason from Florida. You must be Tyler"
12199,Tyler, Yeah. Nice to meet you
12200,Jules, So I know it's weird to me to just stop by but I'm trying to track down Mason
12201,Carol, Mason's back in Florida. He has been for a while now
12202,Jules, See… that's the thing… he's not
12203,Jenna, So now I'm playing historical society hostess to some writer who's doing his book on small town Virginia
12204,Alaric, Well that sounds…
12205,Jenna," Lame, yeah but Carol Lockwood played the dead husband card, she said she was too busy to deal. Plus, my sister kept mostly archives so there you have it"
12206,Tyler, Hey
12207,Caroline, Hey. What's wrong?
12208,Tyler, This girl Mason knows stopped by the house. She said he never made it back to Florida. My mom is freaking out and she was on the phone with your mom when I left.
12209,Tyler, We should get going
12210,Caroline, Yeah
12211,Damon," You should really lock your door. Oh, come on pouty. Just give me two points for ingenuity"
12212,Elena, Do you think this is funny?
12213,Damon, Yes Elena. I find hilarity in the links that I have to go to repeatedly save your life
12214,Elena, What does Stefan say about this?
12215,Damon, Pretty good laugh
12216,Elena, And what did he say about Elijah still being alive?
12217,Damon," Yeah, that… I didn't tell him"
12218,Elena, Why not?
12219,Damon, Well a) he can't do anything about it and b)… what I just said
12220,Damon, Where is Bonnie?
12221,Jeremy, I thought she was meeting you
12222,Damon," No, she's on moonstone duty and I'm on Elena patrol"
12223,Jeremy, And who's on Tyler Lockwood and the full moon?
12224,Damon, Vampire Barbie asked me if she can handle this and why not? Because if she screwed up he'll bite her and then I'll be rid of two of my problems
12225,Elena, Hold on a second. Tonight is a full moon?
12226,Damon, Yeah but you were too absorb with all your suicidal tendencies to notice
12227,Damon, What?
12228,Alaric, Sheriff Forbes has officially declared Mason Lockwood a missing person
12229,Damon, What? Why?
12230,Alaric, Some girl from Florida showed up on the Lockwood's door step looking for Mason
12231,Damon, What girl?
12232,Alaric, I don't know but she sure got everyone and it's easy
12233,Damon, It's not good. Where are you?
12234,Alaric, I'm at the grill
12235,Damon, I'm on my way
12236,Damon, Change of plan. You baby sit
12237,Damon," Hey you know, you should get out, enjoy the sun. Oh wait, you can't"
12238,Caroline, Maybe he just stopped to go surf somewhere. Isn't that Mason's old thing?
12239,Tyler, Maybe. This girl just seem to think he would have called
12240,Caroline, I'm sure he's okay
12241,Tyler," Yeah, anyway… let's do this"
12242,Jules, So you'll call me as soon as you hear anything?
12243,Carol, Of course
12244,Jules," Oh, i didn't get to say goodbye to your son"
12245,Carol, I'm afraid he's at the grill with his friends. I'll let him know. Jules… let's hope for the best
12246,Jules," Hey, I'm here. No one knows where Mason is. He's missing. You were right, Mason was lying, there's another werewolf. His nephew"
12247,Jules," Hey, excuse me. Crazy question: do you know Tyler Lockwood?"
12248,Damon," Mmm, Mason's mystery woman"
12249,Alaric, Where is Mason anyway?
12250,Damon, Decomposing in his truck
12251,Alaric, So you think she is a werewolf?
12252,Damon," Well I hope not, because it's the full moon, Rick but we should definitely find out"
12253,Alaric, What is that?
12254,Damon, Wolf's pain
12255,Caroline, Tell me you brought the instruction menu
12256,Tyler, Tell me you brought the wolfs pain
12257,Caroline, Yes. Not easy to find
12258,Tyler," I have water bottles in my bag, we can mix it in there"
12259,Tyler, The guy at the hardware store said was set up to resist 5000 pounds
12260,Caroline, Is that more than a werewolf can pull?
12261,Tyler, I have no idea
12262,Caroline," Hey Tyler, how are you doing?"
12263,Tyler, Still human
12264,Caroline," Oh my god, you're not getting get naked, are you?"
12265,Tyler," It's elastic. What should I wear? I don't think it's like the hulk, I can keep my pants"
12266,Bonnie, Hi
12267,Luka, I don't know what makes me more upset: that i showed you how to channel or that you almost k*ll me
12268,Bonnie," Luka, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't have done what i did unless it was really important. It's just that there are things that i…"
12269,Luka, I forgive you
12270,Bonnie, Wow. So much stuff. What is that? Is this a grimoire?
12271,Luka, They're all grimoires
12272,Bonnie, How did you get all these?
12273,Luka," Witches from all over the world have collected their spells in grimoires but over the centuries, most of them gotten lost and my dad is obsessed finding them, making sure that our family's heritage stays intact"
12274,Bonnie, This can't all be your family's
12275,Luka," Well how he sees it all, witches are family. We're all bounded together by code of loyalty to help each other"
12276,Bonnie, So that's why you've been so nice to me
12277,Luka, That's one reason
12278,Bonnie, Listen… do you know how to break the bind between a talisman and a spell?
12279,Luka, That depends because spells are unique and very specific but I'm sure we can figure it out
12280,Alaric, Well hello. Can I have a scotch and what this beautiful woman is drinking
12281,Jules," No, one is my limit"
12282,Alaric," Oh come on, it's not like I'm a freak. I'm just friendly to somebody who's knew to town"
12283,Jules," Okay, if you insist. How do you know I'm new?"
12284,Alaric, Because I've never seen you here before and i am here every night
12285,Damon," Excuse me, is this guy bothering you?"
12286,Alaric, I'm not bothering anybody
12287,Damon, Perfect. Well…. Do it elsewhere
12288,Damon," Don't worry, he's harmless. He's the town drunk you know"
12289,Alaric, Please don't talk about me like I'm not here
12290,Damon, Why are you here?
12291,Jules, Thank you for the drink
12292,Katherine," So we're fasting now? We're so piece. How long have you actually gone without bl*od? I know you get desiccated in theory, Stefan but in reality, it's much worse. Your heart still b*at, struggling to pomp whatever bl*od remains. When it's gone, your veins rub together like sent paper. It's excruciating"
12293,Stefan, The pleasure of watching you suffer is greatest than any pain I'll ever feel
12294,Katherine," It's stuffy and I've been in this dress for days. You want to help me get out of it? Come on, Stefan. Don't be such a grump."
12295,Katherine, We're here together. Please make the best out of it
12296,Katherine, You really think Damon is gonna rush to get you out? He's got what he wants: Elena
12297,Stefan, Stop
12298,Katherine," Given what is mastery gone out there, I'd say you're free to do whatever you want in here. Nobody will ever know"
12299,Stefan, Stay out of my head
12300,Katherine, Maybe i can do eternity in here after all
12301,Elena," Hey, what are you doing?"
12302,Jenna, Perfect timing
12303,Elena, What is this stuff?
12304,Jenna," You mom's file from the historical society. I got roped into helping Mrs. Lockwood and by roped, I mean very excited to participate"
12305,Elijah," Hey, I'm Elijah"
12306,Jenna, Elijah is in town doing research on Mystic Falls
12307,Elijah, It's a pleasure
12308,Jenna, So you're welcome to stay here and ramage through this stuff or Elena and i could help you load it into our car
12309,Elijah, Or i can get someone to pick it up tomorrow
12310,Jenna, Also a good plan
12311,Elijah," Thank you so much for inviting me into your home, Jenna and Elena…"
12312,Elijah, I hope to see you again sometime soon
12313,Jeremy, What is it?
12314,Elena, Jenna was just asking me to get you help her with the boxes
12315,Jeremy, Okay
12316,Elijah, It's a wise choice
12317,Elena, What do you want?
12318,Elijah, I think it's time you and i have a little chat
12319,Damon," There's a b&b on the road and there's a motel on the I9 but you know, if you ask me, it's kind of a mistake"
12320,Jules," No it's fine. I'm just here for the night. It's a long story, looking for my friend"
12321,Damon, Who?
12322,Jules, Mason Lockwood
12323,Damon, I know Mason
12324,Jules, You do?
12325,Damon, Yeah. He's a great guy
12326,Jules, He's missing
12327,Damon," What do you mean? Like… I mean, missing, missing?"
12328,Jules, How do you know Mason?
12329,Damon, Friend of friends
12330,Tyler, What time is it?
12331,Caroline, Almost 8. What time does the moon cross whatever?
12332,Tyler, Not for a while. Mason's journal said the first transformation can happen before the moon it's at his highest
12333,Caroline, Does it say how long you'll actually be a wolf?
12334,Tyler, A few hours. Maybe more maybe less
12335,Caroline, Are you sure you want to do that?
12336,Tyler, Yeah. Mason said it'll diminish my strength so I can't break free
12337,Caroline, Tyler…
12338,Tyler, No
12339,Caroline, Shut…
12340,Tyler, Don't!
12341,Tyler, I'm sorry
12342,Elijah, Forgive the intrusion. I mean your family no harm
12343,Elena, Why did you k*ll those vampires when they tried to take me?
12344,Elijah, Because i didn't want you to be taken. Klaus is the most feared and hated of the originals but those who fear him are desperate for his approval. If the word gets out that the doppelganger exist there'll be a line of vampires eager to take you to him and i can't have that
12345,Elena, Isn't that exactly what you're trying to do?
12346,Elijah, Let's just say that my goal is not to break the curse
12347,Elena, So what is your goal?
12348,Elijah, Klaus's obsession has made him paranoid. He's a recluse. He trust only those in his immediately circle
12349,Elena, Like you?
12350,Elijah, Not anymore
12351,Elena," You don't know where he is, do you? So you're trying to use me to dry him out"
12352,Elijah," Well, to do that I need you to stay put and stop trying to get yourself k*ll"
12353,Elena, How do i know you're telling the truth?
12354,Elijah," If I wasn't being trustful, your family would be dead and I'd be taking you to Klaus right now. Instead, I'm here and I'm preparing to offer you a deal"
12355,Elena, What kind of a deal?
12356,Elijah," Do nothing. Do nothing, leave your life, stop fighting and then, when the time is right, you and i should drop Klaus to get out and I should make sure your friends remain unharmed"
12357,Elena, And then what?
12358,Elijah, Then I k*ll him
12359,Elena, Just like that?
12360,Elijah," Just like that. I'm a man of my word, Elena. I make a deal, I keep a deal"
12361,Elena, How are you gonna be able to keep everybody safe?
12362,Elijah," I notice you have a friend Bonnie, is it? She seems to possess the gift of magic. I have friends with similar gifts"
12363,Elena, You know witches
12364,Elijah, Together we can protect you and everybody that matters to you. So do we have a deal?
12365,Elena, I need you to do one more thing for me
12366,Elijah, you're negotiating now?
12367,Luka," You know, this is good. This is really good. There's a clear view of the moon and it's private"
12368,Bonnie," And if anyone looks out, they're gonna think we're insane"
12369,Luka, Are we? So what is this mysterious talisman we're binding?
12370,Luka," Oh, a white rock. This is fascinating"
12371,Bonnie, Hey! I know it doesn't look like much…
12372,Luka, What's spelled with?
12373,Luka," Really? Help a girl out, she still keeps secrets"
12374,Bonnie, Sorry
12375,Luka, I'm just teasing you
12376,Caroline, Tyler…
12377,Tyler, I'm burning up. It burns!
12378,Caroline," I know. Just breathe, okay?"
12379,Tyler, I'm trying. You should go. You should leave
12380,Caroline, Not yet
12381,Tyler, It hurts. It hurts
12382,Damon," You know, I'm really tied with the sheriff. If there anything I can do to help looking Mason, I will. He's a great guy and after his brother's funeral, he stuck around and he helped his nephew and…"
12383,Jules, Tyler?
12384,Damon, Yep. Mason was with him the whole time. Helped him with all that grief. You haven't touched your drink
12385,Jules," You know, I'm not much of a drinker. I should get going"
12386,Damon," Oh, come on. Look, one drink"
12387,Jules, It'll help me sleep
12388,Damon, To sleep
12389,Jules," You fool. You think you're clever, don't you?"
12390,Damon, What do you want with Mason Lockwood?
12391,Jules, He's my friend
12392,Damon," Well, I'm sorry to inform you that you probably won't find him"
12393,Jules, And why not?
12394,Damon, You should leave town
12395,Jules, You're threatening me? On a full moon. How stupid are you?
12396,Alaric, How about that second round?
12397,Damon," I think we're done, Rick"
12398,Damon, You think i'm afraid of you?
12399,Jules," No, i don't. That's your vampire arrogance. You should be. I sniffed you out the moment you entered this bar along with your pathetic wolfs pain. I had this a long time and any other night of the month, the situation would be reversed but tonight is not the night to pick a fight with me. You've been marked"
12400,Caroline, I want to help but I don't know what to do
12401,Tyler, There's nothing you can do
12402,Tyler, Get out
12403,Caroline, No
12404,Tyler, Get out! I don't want to hurt you
12405,Caroline," No, no"
12406,Damon, Where is she?
12407,Alaric," Just let her go, Damon. Don't be stupid"
12408,Damon, So what? Just let her get away? « You've been marked » What the hell kind of wolf flow down crap is that anyway?
12409,Alaric," Damon, look up! Just look up."
12410,Alaric," If this werewolf stuff is true, one bite and you're dead. One bite! Alright? Don't risk it. Just go home, lock your doors and we'll deal with it in the morning"
12411,Damon, Yeah
12412,Caroline," It's okay. You'll fight it, okay?"
12413,Tyler, Leave
12414,Caroline, No
12415,Tyler," Just go, please!"
12416,Caroline," No, not yet"
12417,Tyler, Just go!
12418,Caroline, I'm right here and I'm not going anywhere
12419,Damon," You just can't stay away, can you?"
12420,Rose, You don't answer your phone
12421,Damon, What do you want?
12422,Rose, I wanted to apologize
12423,Damon," Just admit it, you don't have anywhere else to go"
12424,Rose," I'm sorry about Elena. I wasn't thinking straight. I didn't know she had a death wish but I called you, I tried to make it right, okay? I'm sorry, Damon and I have nowhere else to go"
12425,Damon," There's nothing for you here, Rose"
12426,Rose," Well, then…"
12427,Damon, How bad is it?
12428,Rose, It hurts
12429,Damon, It's healing
12430,Rose," oh my god, I thought a werewolf bite was fatal and I thought…"
12431,Jonas, You were successful?
12432,Luka, Of course I was. She fell for the whole… show and didn't suspect a thing
12433,Jonas," Thank you, Luka"
12434,Luka," Yeah, whatever. I'm going to sleep"
12435,Jonas, Wait. There's one more thing Elijah needs us to do before we lose the full moon
12436,Katherine, Are we seriously not going to talk at all?
12437,Stefan, We could talk about how you regret all you've done to make my life miserable
12438,Katherine," What do you want me to say, Stefan? That I'm sorry for everything that I've done? Well I'm not, okay? It's called self preservation. I've been looking out for myself for 500 years"
12439,Stefan, Look were it has gotten you
12440,Katherine," Yes, I've done terrible things. I know that but I do love you, Stefan. Even if you don't believe it"
12441,Stefan, You want me to believe you? Show me. Do something. Prove to me that there's something inside of you that's actually worst
12442,Katherine, And then what? You'll still hate me
12443,Stefan, Maybe and maybe I'll see that there's still hope for you after all
12444,Katherine, You're playing me
12445,Stefan, Am I?
12446,Katherine, You want to find Klaus? k*ll him so that you can protect your precious Elena?
12447,Stefan, Let me guess: you know where he is
12448,Katherine," No, I don't but I could help you find him"
12449,Stefan, For a price I'm sure
12450,Katherine," Let's start with Isobel, Elena's mother. She was a research expert. She found me"
12451,Katherine, You're welcome
12452,Katherine, Elijah
12453,Elijah, Good evening Katerina. Thank you for having the good sense to be frightened 
12454,Elijah, Your release has been requested
12455,Stefan, What? By who?
12456,Elijah," The lovely Elena drives a hard bargain. however we reached a peaceful agreement, she and I. Please"
12457,Elijah, Come
12458,Stefan, I can't
12459,Elijah, Yes you can. I've had the spell lifted
12460,Elijah," As for you however, you should not exit until I say so. When Klaus comes he'll want to know exactly where you are"
12461,Elijah," You're free to go. Elena will explain the arrangement to you. If she keeps her world, I'll keep mine"
12462,Katherine," Stefan, no. please don't let him leave me in here"
12463,Stefan, Goodbye Katherine
12464,Caroline, Are you okay? You made it. You didn't get out. You're okay
12465,Tyler," No, I'm not"
12466,Damon, I talked to Caroline. She said Tyler was all locked up
12467,Rose," So it was Jules. The other werewolf, the one who attacked you"
12468,Damon, Yeah. I'm sorry. I picked a fight with her. She was coming after me
12469,Rose, All's well that ends well
12470,Damon, You're all healed?
12471,Rose, Yeah. Seems that way
12472,Damon, Rose… I'm happy that the legend was fake. Maybe the werewolf made it out to keep vampires away
12473,Rose, Lucky me
12474,Rose, I'm gonna stay and help you
12475,Damon, Help me do what?
12476,Rose," Save Elena, protect Elena, all things Elena"
12477,Damon, Really? Why?
12478,Rose, Because I like you. I believe in friendship. I happen to have a vacancy in that department and you can use all the friends you can get
12479,Damon, Just friends?
12480,Rose, Just friends
12481,Damon, Are you sure you can do that?
12482,Rose, I don't love men who love other women. I think more of myself but it doesn't mean I can't be your special friend
12483,Damon, I think I like you
12484,Rose, Woo
12485,Policeman, good morning. Is everything alright here?
12486,Jules, It was an animal. Fragment (consider revising) He came at us at the night
12487,Policeman, Are you okay?
12488,Jules, Yes but my friends! They're all dead
12489,Policeman, I'm calling item
12490,Elena," Stefan? Stefan? You're standing right behind me, aren't you?"
12491,Stefan, Yep
12492,Stefan, Good morning
12493,Elena, I don't want us to be apart anymore. Never
12494,Stefan," Me neither, but…"
12495,Elena, Don't ruin the moment
12496,Elena," You're about to ruin the moment, aren't you?"
12497,Stefan," I'm totally ruining the moment. Look, I can't just pretend like everything is okay"
12498,Elena, Katherine's locked away in the tomb
12499,Stefan, I know but we've still this pressing little issue of you being Klaus' human sacrifice
12500,Elena, Yeah but Elijah promised to keep me and everyone else safe as long as we'd play by his rules
12501,Stefan, Right. As long as you'll play by his rules
12502,Elena, Please don't go after Isobel
12503,Stefan," Katherine said Isobel could have some answers and I just have a couple questions, that's all"
12504,Elena," Stefan, I made a deal with Elijah"
12505,Stefan," Right, you made a deal with him. I didn't make one. You should keep your deal"
12506,Elena," Stefan, I don't want anyone else to get hurt"
12507,Stefan, When have I ever wanted somebody to get hurt?
12508,Elena, Vervain. I made it late but are you sure? Just because Katherine build up a tolerance…
12509,Stefan," Yes, bottoms up"
12510,Elena, Are you okay?
12511,Stefan, Yeah
12512,Elena, How can Elijah compel another vampire?
12513,Stefan," He's an original. I don't really know what that means. I don't think anybody really knows what that means. Well, except maybe Isobel. I'll maybe we should ask her"
12514,Rose," I was born in 1450, that makes me 560 years old"
12515,Damon," Well, if you were a bottle of wine…"
12516,Rose, So I can die. I've lived long enough
12517,Damon," You know, if you're gonna be morn, I'm just gonna k*ll you myself just to put me out of your misery."
12518,Damon," Come on, it's just a little werewolf bite"
12519,Rose," Just a lethal, fatal to a vampire werewolf bite"
12520,Damon," Well, according to a legend which is notoriously unreliable source. Drink out"
12521,Damon, bl*od heals
12522,Rose," Yeah, it does feel like it's working"
12523,Damon," Let's have a look, come on. Let me see"
12524,Rose, How is it?
12525,Damon," Definitely better. Right, Elena? "
12526,Elena," Uh, it's not bad."
12527,Damon, Where's Stefan?
12528,Elena, He left. I need you to talk to him. He's convinced that he has to find Isobel but I think that's gonna upset Elijah
12529,Damon," No, can't do. I'm with Stefan on this one but if you could play nurse for a little while…"
12530,Rose, It's not necessary
12531,Damon," It is necessary. Elena is a do-gooder. It's in her nature, she just can't resist"
12532,Elena, Damon. Is she gonna die?
12533,Damon, Probably. The wolf bite caused some kind of infection and it's getting worse
12534,Elena, Like poison?
12535,Damon," I don't know, Elena. I'm not an expert in the field"
12536,Elena, I'm sorry
12537,Damon," Death happens. We come, we go. Sooner she dies will better. It's gloomy as hell in here "
12538,Caroline, How are you feeling?
12539,Tyler," I'm okay. I'm sore, every muscle hakes"
12540,Caroline," You did it. You know, you… your first full moon and you didn't hurt anyone. It'll get easier. You'll get better at it, you'll learn how to control it and it won't hurt so much"
12541,Tyler," Well, we don't know any of that for sure"
12542,Caroline," No but small victories, Tyler. Last night was a victory. You know, let's take it"
12543,Tyler," Look, I really want to thank you. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there"
12544,Caroline," Yeah, anyway, uh… next month we should probably reinforce the wall because you almost got me that one time and it just would have been, uh…"
12545,Tyler, What?
12546,Caroline," Never mind, it's…"
12547,Tyler," Hey, no, hey. What is it?"
12548,Caroline," Well, it's not a big thing, it's just that one bites and it's… you know, curtains for me"
12549,Tyler, What are you talking about?
12550,Caroline, The legend says that a bite from a werewolf can k*ll a vampire
12551,Tyler, How do you know that?
12552,Caroline, I… read it somewhere…
12553,Matt," Caroline, you got a second?"
12554,Tyler," Hey, Matt"
12555,Caroline," Yeah, sure"
12556,Tyler, I'll see you guys later
12557,Caroline," That was nothing, okay? There is nothing going on between Tyler and I, we were just talking…"
12558,Matt," I believe you. Look, Caroline, you're a lot a things but you're not a liar. You've always been strait with me, I believe you"
12559,Caroline," Well, good"
12560,Matt, And that's why I want to be strait with you because I… I think we have some wires crossed here
12561,Caroline," Oh, okay"
12562,Matt, And you know how tauter I get and I don't like this. Whatever this is that's going on between us and I… I just want to…
12563,Caroline," Hey, you can't"
12564,Matt, Why?
12565,Caroline, That's just…
12566,Matt, But Carrie…
12567,Caroline," No Matt, okay?"
12568,Jules," Sheriff Forbes, hi. I'm Mason Lockwood's friend from Florida"
12569,Sheriff," Jules, right?"
12570,Jules, Is there any news?
12571,Sheriff, No one's heard from him. I've opened an investigation. As soon as I hear anything I let you know
12572,Alaric," Hey, Damon. The wolf is at the grill"
12573,Stefan, Is it the….?
12574,Alaric," Yeah, yeah. I just left Damon a message"
12575,Stefan, So you're doing his dirty work for him now
12576,Alaric, She could have a cure for Rose. I couldn't find anything in Isobel's research except that it's fatal
12577,Stefan, Do you still have a way to get in touch wit Isobel?
12578,Alaric," Even if I did, she isn't gonna help"
12579,Stefan, Katherine said that Isobel knew of Klaus
12580,Alaric," So this isn't about Rose, it's about Elena. I have an old number, probably out of service"
12581,Stefan, No harm in giving it to me then?
12582,Alaric," You know you can't trust Isobel, even when it comes to Elena"
12583,Stefan, I know that
12584,Alaric," Alright. I'm gonna see if I can find the number. If I do, I'll text it to you"
12585,Rose," I hate this. I'm a vampire, I've never had a cold in five centuries"
12586,Elena, Just get in the bed
12587,Rose," We don't get sick. When we die, it's fast and sudden and it's certainly not drawn out in illness"
12588,Elena, You're not gonna die
12589,Rose, It's such a human thing to say
12590,Rose," You've never been in Damon's room before, have you?"
12591,Rose, Not what you expected?
12592,Elena, It's just a room with a bed. Maybe I expected them to be silk sheets
12593,Rose," You're lucky, you know. No one's ever love me the way you're loved"
12594,Elena, I doubt that
12595,Rose, Trevor was my best friend. Nothing more. I spent all this years on the run from Elijah. I just never thought it was a good idea to set up roots. The whole idea of family is not exactly compatible with being a vampire. Why are you so eager to give up?
12596,Elena, I'm not giving up on anything
12597,Rose, What do you call this all deal with Elijah?
12598,Elena, I call it my best option
12599,Rose, It's the easiest option
12600,Elena, That's not fair
12601,Rose, Do you really think that your witch friend destroyed the moonstone?
12602,Elena," I spoke with Bonnie. I know that she had the help of another witch; unless you mean it's Elijah's witch so no, I don't"
12603,Rose," You really are determined to die, aren't you? At least I ran, you're not even trying"
12604,Rose, I'm so tired
12605,Rose," No, stop, wait. Tell them to prepare the horses"
12606,Elena, It's okay Rose. Just get some sleep. You'll feel better when you'll wake up
12607,Rose," Trevor, don't be so stupid. You'll never going to make it there before the sun"
12608,Rose," Elena, Elena, I need more bl*od"
12609,Elena," Yeah, of course, here"
12610,Elena," It's okay, everything's gonna be alright"
12611,Rose," Everything's your fault, Katerina. You Katerina, you did this"
12612,Elena," No Rose, I'm Elena"
12613,Rose, You betrayed us!
12614,Elena, I'm not Katherine!
12615,Rose, Elena?
12616,Elena," It's me, it's Elena"
12617,Rose, Oh my god Elena. I'm so sorry. I don't know what's happening to me. I'm sorry
12618,Elena, You're gonna be alright
12619,Rose," My mind, I'm…"
12620,Elena, It was just for a second
12621,Rose," I'm sorry, don't be scared of me"
12622,Elena, I'm not. I'm not but you need to rest
12623,Rose, I'm scared
12624,Elena, You're not alone. I'm right here
12625,Rose," Here, where's here?"
12626,Elena," Damon's bedroom, you're in Damon's bedroom"
12627,Rose, I want to go home
12628,Elena, Tell me about it
12629,Rose," St.Austell, 30 kilometers of the south of London. With fields and trees and horses"
12630,Elena, Sounds beautiful
12631,Rose," When you live long enough, everything disappears. So much time wasted, I just wish I wouldn't have been so afraid"
12632,Stefan," Isobel, it's Stefan Salvatore. I need to speak with you, it's about Elena. Please know that it's important"
12633,Damon, What are you doing here?
12634,Stefan," I was waiting for you. Listen, there's a lot of people here"
12635,Damon," Oh, damn. My plan was to rip her spleen through her back"
12636,Stefan," Hey, listen, I know you're upset about Rose"
12637,Damon," Why does everyone think that I'm upset about Rose? I'm fine. I don't know if you know this but sometimes, vampires die. I'm gonna have a friendly chat with lady wolf, brother. Ease up"
12638,Jules," Well, if he doesn't the one I meant to k*ll…I'll have to get that right next time"
12639,Damon, You won't leave to see another full moon unless… unless you tell me how to cure a wolf bite and then I won't k*ll you
12640,Jules, Promise?
12641,Damon, Yes
12642,Jules, Bite me
12643,Jules, I'm not afraid of you
12644,Damon," Then you are very, very stupid"
12645,Jules," How's your friend? Rose, is that her name? have the chills started? The unbearable pain?"
12646,Damon," If there's a cure, tell me or start watching your back"
12647,Jules, Did I mention the dementia? It'll eat away her brain. Soon she'll be rabid. You want a cure? I'll tell you the only cure that exists: take a stake and drive it through her heart
12648,Elena, I brought some clean sheets
12649,Elena," It's Elena, I'm worried about Rose. I think you should come home"
12650,Elena, Oh my god
12651,Rose, Katerina
12652,Elena, No
12653,Elena," Rose, stop, stop, it's Elena. I'm not Katherine"
12654,Elena, You're hallucinating. I'm not Katherine
12655,Rose," Elena? I know that's you and not Katerina. Elena, please, I need your help"
12656,Matt, Caroline. Why?
12657,Caroline, Why what?
12658,Matt, I kissed you
12659,Caroline," I know, I was there"
12660,Matt, So why did you run away?
12661,Caroline, You got me off guard
12662,Matt, Yeah?
12663,Caroline, What did you except me to do?
12664,Matt, Not that
12665,Caroline," Well, I'm sorry"
12666,Matt, And…?
12667,Caroline," And what? What do you want me to say, Matt?"
12668,Matt," Something, anything. How did you feel? Anything in the roam of truth right now would be nice"
12669,Caroline," Okay, I feel… like I…. I love you"
12670,Matt," I love you then what's the problem? What are you keeping from me, Carrie? Look, if you love, you'll tell me so what is it?"
12671,Dana," Hey Matt, we need more burgers"
12672,Matt," Yeah, not now Dana"
12673,Damon, Are you okay? Where's Rose?
12674,Elena, I don't know
12675,Man," Excuse me, are you okay?"
12676,Damon, Hey
12677,Sheriff, Thanks for coming so quickly
12678,Damon," No, I was close by Liz, what happened?"
12679,Sheriff, A vampire. Luckily one of my deputies discovered the body before anyone else saw him
12680,Damon, You have to secure the area then
12681,Sheriff," I take the east side of the school, you go west?"
12682,Damon," Sure, okay"
12683,Elena," Hey, Stefan, it's me. I don't know where you are but please call me. It's important"
12684,Elena, Hey. Have you heard from him? Do you know what he's up to?
12685,Damon, My baby brother is not exactly my priority right now. Take this
12686,Damon," Come on, let's go"
12687,Boy," Hey, what was going on back there with the police?"
12688,Girl, Some maintenance man had a hard attack. He was drop dead
12689,Girl, Eddie?
12690,Damon," Rose, stop!"
12691,Damon," Rose, Rose! It's me, it's Damon"
12692,Rose, Did I do this? I never meant to heart anyone. I never wanted to hurt anyone
12693,Damon, I know
12694,Rose," I'm sorry, I'm so sorry"
12695,Damon," Come on, let's get you home"
12696,Rose," no, I don't have a home, I didn't had a home in so long"
12697,Rose," Oh make it stop, please make it stop!"
12698,Damon, Hi there
12699,Rose, I'm sorry
12700,Damon, You went on a m*rder drop age. It happens
12701,Rose," I'm sorry, Elena. I don't like taking human lives, I never have"
12702,Damon, You shouldn't be here
12703,Rose," It's the worst part about it: the hunt, the need to k*ll, the thirst, the pleasure it brings you afterwards. I wasn't meant to be evil. It hurts"
12704,Damon, Stop talking about it
12705,Rose, Damon's a lot like me. He wants to care but when he does he runs away from it. I'm sorry for what I've done today
12706,Elena, I know
12707,Rose, And you need to fight. I know you're scared but you have to do it anyway
12708,Rose, Why are you so nice to me?
12709,Elena, Us humans
12710,Rose," You can't never forget it, what it's like to be human. It haunts me. It's the only thing that keeps me going. It doesn't hurt much anymore"
12711,Elena, What do we do?
12712,Damon, Go
12713,Elena, Damon…
12714,Damon," Just go, I got this"
12715,Rose," Oh god! Make it stop, make it stop! I can't take it anymore, make it stop!"
12716,Tyler, Hey. Where have you been?
12717,Caroline, At school. What's up? What's going on?
12718,Tyler, We need to talk
12719,Caroline, Why? What's wrong with you?
12720,Tyler, I just don't understand one thing
12721,Caroline, What?
12722,Tyler, Why would you risk it? If a werewolf bite k*ll a vampire… why would you risk it?
12723,Caroline, Because you needed help
12724,Tyler, I could have k*ll you
12725,Caroline, But you didn't
12726,Tyler," I don't understand you, Caroline"
12727,Caroline, Why is it so hard for you to let someone else help you?
12728,Tyler, That's not it
12729,Caroline," Yes it is, Tyler. It's like you don't want anyone to care about you and I'm sorry I cared. I care Tyler so forgive me if I overstepped my boundaries by actually giving in"
12730,Caroline, You can't do that
12731,Tyler," I'm sorry, it's…"
12732,Caroline, Everyone just need to stop kissing me!
12733,Rose, Who would have thought you'd be nice?
12734,Damon, I‘m not nice. I'm mean. I like it
12735,Rose, You're lying
12736,Damon," Shut, shut, just sleep. Just sleep"
12737,Rose, This was my favorite place to comes ago. How did you know?
12738,Damon, Word gets around. You told Elena
12739,Rose, Am I dreaming?
12740,Rose, The sun is so warm. I miss this. I miss being human
12741,Damon, Humanity is not all cranked off to be
12742,Rose," I had friends, I had a family, I mattered"
12743,Damon, You still do
12744,Rose, no but you do. You built a life whether you want to admit it or not. I spent 500 years just existing
12745,Damon," You didn't have a choice, you were running from Klaus"
12746,Rose, There's always a choice
12747,Damon," You know, you're ruining our perfect day with your strange philosophical babbling"
12748,Rose, I'd like to enjoy the fresh air. Would you enjoy it with me?
12749,Damon, For a while
12750,Rose, Thank you
12751,Damon, For what?
12752,Rose, The pain's gone
12753,Damon, I'm glad
12754,Rose, Will I see them again? My family?
12755,Damon, I think you'll see whoever you want to see
12756,Rose, That would be nice. Maybe I'll see Trevor too. I'm not afraid anymore
12757,Rose, I'll race you to the trees
12758,Damon," Well, you'll lose"
12759,Rose, I'm older and faster
12760,Damon," Oh, you think?"
12761,Damon," Well, I'm compelling this dream. Maybe I'll cheat"
12762,Rose," On the count of three. One, two, three"
12763,Damon, Here's your vampire
12764,Sheriff, How did you find her?
12765,Damon, It doesn't matter. What matters is that it's over
12766,Sheriff," Thank you Damon. Once again, you've help keep this town safe"
12767,Damon, I'll take care of burying the body 
12768,Jules, Thank you for coming
12769,Tyler, So what do you want from me?
12770,Jules, Just to be your friend. Mason would have wanted that. I know about Mason and you
12771,Tyler, You know what?
12772,Jules, I know you're a werewolf and I know your little friend Caroline is a vampire
12773,Tyler, How do you know about Caroline?
12774,Jules, You can't sniff them out?
12775,Jules, Oh my god. You're brand new. How many times have you turned?
12776,Jules," Hey, I can help you"
12777,Tyler, Do you know where Mason is?
12778,Jules," He's dead, Tyler. He was m*rder"
12779,Tyler, No
12780,Jules, You want to know who m*rder him?
12781,Tyler, Just stop
12782,Jules, Your little blond vampire did
12783,Tyler," No, Caroline would never do this"
12784,Jules," She and her little vampires friends were behind it, Tyler"
12785,Tyler, Caroline is the only vampire in town
12786,Jules," Is that what she told you? She lied, this town is crawling with vampires but don't worry, we'll get them"
12787,Tyler, Who are you?
12788,Jules, I'm your friend. There are others like us and they're on their way
12789,Damon, You were supposed to leave
12790,Elena, I did but then I came back to make sure that you're okay
12791,Damon, I appreciate the gesture. I'm just glad it's over
12792,Elena, You know I don't believe that
12793,Damon," Go home, Elena. Get some rest. It's a whole new day tomorrow"
12794,Elena," Damon, I'm you're friend"
12795,Damon, I'm well aware of that
12796,Elena, And a friend usually knows when her friend is hurting
12797,Damon, What do you want to hear? That I cared about Rose? That I'm upset? Well I didn't and I'm not
12798,Elena," There you go, pretending to turn it off, pretending not to feel. Damon, you're so close, don't give up"
12799,Damon," I feel Elena, okay? And it sucks! What sucks even more is that it was supposed to be me. Jules was coming after me"
12800,Elena, You feel guilty
12801,Damon," That would be human of me, wouldn't Elena? And I'm not human. You want to talk about giving up? All you've done is give up! Go home. It's been enough doom, gloom and personnel growth for one night"
12802,Elena," Okay, I will"
12803,Elena, Good night Damon
12804,Elena," Stefan, you're home"
12805,Stefan, Rose? I… I called Isobel
12806,Elena, I know
12807,Stefan," I'm sorry, I had to"
12808,Elena, It's okay. Did you find her
12809,Uncle John, Not exactly. Hello Elena
12810,Elena, Uncle John
12811,Jessica," Sir, are you okay? What happened?"
12812,Damon, I'm… lost
12813,Jessica, And you're laying in the middle of the road?
12814,Damon, Not that kind of lost
12815,Damon," Metaphorically, existentially"
12816,Jessica, Do you need help?
12817,Damon," Well, yes I do. Can you help me?"
12818,Jessica, You're drunk
12819,Damon," No. Well, yes a little maybe"
12820,Damon, No please don't leave. I really do need help
12821,Damon, Don't move
12822,Jessica, I don't want ant trouble
12823,Damon, Neither do I but it's al I got: trouble
12824,Jessica, Why can't I move?
12825,Damon, What's your name?
12826,Jessica, Jessica
12827,Damon," Hi Jessica. I have a secret, I have a big one but I never said it out load. I mean, what's the point? It's not gonna change anything, it's not gonna make me good, made me an adopted puppy. I can't be what other people want me to be, what she wants me to be. This is who I am, Jessica."
12828,Jessica, Are you gonna hurt me?
12829,Damon, I'm not sure because you are my existential crisis. Do I k*ll you or do I not k*ll you?
12830,Jessica, Please don't
12831,Damon," But I have to, Jessica because I'm not human and I miss it. I miss it more than anything in the world! That is m secret but there is only so much hurt a man can take"
12832,Jessica," Please, don't"
12833,Damon, You're free to go
12834,Caroline, Hey. How is it going?
12835,Tyler, We need to talk
12836,Caroline," Yeah, we do. Listen… I've been thinking about it and I don't want to overanalyze. It was just one kiss but Matt's still kind in the picture. We can't go there, Tyler"
12837,Tyler, Fine
12838,Caroline, Great. That's settled
12839,Tyler, What happened to my uncle Mason?
12840,Caroline, What?
12841,Tyler, He's dead and I want you to tell me what happened
12842,Caroline, I… I don't…
12843,Tyler," Then let me tell you: Stefan and his brother Damon k*ll him because Stefan and Damon are vampires, just like you"
12844,Caroline, Who told you that? 
12845,Tyler, Is it true?
12846,Caroline, Let me explain
12847,Tyler, Did you know he was dead this whole time?
12848,Caroline, Please
12849,Tyler, Did you know?!
12850,Caroline," I'm sorry, Tyler. I'm sorry"
12851,Tyler, I trusted you!
12852,Andie Star," The authorities believe last night's assailant may also be related to the missing campers and Park ranger who have yet to be found as well as 25 years old Jessica Koenig, reported missing this morning. The sheriff department says investigations are pending and no further comment will be made."
12853,John, Good morning
12854,Elena, What are you doing here?
12855,John, Coffee?
12856,Elena," We're not doing that. We did that last night, no more avoiding. Why are you here?"
12857,John, I'm here to protect you. That's all I can say for the moment
12858,Elena, What do you mean that's all you can say?
12859,John, I'll tell you more when I'm convinced I can trust you
12860,Jenna, What the hell?
12861,John," Good morning to you, Jenna. Alaric…"
12862,Jenna," It's okay I'm confused, right? Because we were not excepting you like ever"
12863,John," Well, I gotten late last night. Elena let me in"
12864,Alaric," You know, I probably just gonna take off"
12865,Jenna, I'm still confused here
12866,John, I decided to come back and stay for a while
12867,Jenna," Not here, you're not"
12868,John," Actually, you can't stop me from living here"
12869,Jenna," Actually I can, as legal guardian"
12870,John," Yeah, about that… Elena, you want me to explain the situation or would you like to do the honors?"
12871,Jenna," Okay, what's going on?"
12872,Elena," I'm sorry, Jenna. I should have told you earlier but…"
12873,John," I'm Elena's biological father. There, now you know"
12874,Jenna, What?!
12875,Damon, You brought back John Gilbert? That was your big save Elena move?
12876,Stefan, I went to go look for Isobel and I get John instead. He said he can help us and we're desperate
12877,Damon," we're not that desperate, Stefan. The guy tried to barbecue me!"
12878,Stefan," Damon, Bonnie's new witch friend is working with Elijah so we have to assume that the moonstone was never destroyed . Elena is putting all of her faith into some deal that she made with Elijah to keep everyone safe. I mean, do you trust Elijah? I don't trust him. He's an original, he can't be trusted. It's not like we can just go up and k*ll him because apparently he can't die!"
12879,Damon, I'm still waiting for the part where John Gilbert is the answer
12880,Stefan, He knew about the sacrifice . Isobel told him. He said he know of a way to keep Elena safe
12881,Damon, And how do we do that?
12882,Stefan, He's not talking. At least not to me anyway
12883,Damon, Great work Stefan. Top notch. As if I didn't have enough problems
12884,Stefan," Hey, I'm sorry about Rose"
12885,Damon, Whatever. I knew the woman for 5 minutes
12886,Stefan, And you cared about her after 5 minutes. I wonder what that means
12887,Damon," It means I care, Stefan. That's means I'm changing evolving into a man capable of greatness. Better watch your back because I may just have to go get a hero hairdo of my own and steal your thunder"
12888,Stefan, What's wrong?
12889,Caroline, Tyler knows about you and Damon. He knows that Damon k*ll Mason. I didn't say a word
12890,Stefan," It's that woman, Jules. She had a run with Damon"
12891,Caroline," Tyler was so upset. The look on his face, he was so betrayed"
12892,Stefan," Wow, this is bad"
12893,Caroline," You're not gonna tell Damon, are you?"
12894,Stefan," No, he already wants to k*ll him. He thinks all werewolves should die and he's not wrong to think that, Caroline. I mean, what if Tyler wants to retaliate? He has every right to. He could get himself k*ll"
12895,Caroline," Well, we're not gonna let that happen. We have to get to him and reason with him before he does something stupid. You have to talk to him. Just try to explain, you know? You always know the right thing to say, okay? He and I… we're friends"
12896,Jules," I was right, wasn't I? your little vampire friend, she was lying"
12897,Tyler, What do you want?
12898,Jules, I want you to understand that a vampire will never be your friend. It's our nature to be enemies
12899,Tyler, You know how stupid that sounds?
12900,Jules," You need to leave here, it's not safe"
12901,Tyler, I can't just run away with you. I don't even know you. My mom would freak. My life is here
12902,Jules, Your old life. Your new life is just beginning. You have so much to learn
12903,Tyler, Like what?
12904,Jules," How to survive. You've triggered the curse, Tyler. It's important you learn what it means to be a lycanthrope. We live by a code of loyalty. We take care of each other. It's my duty and honor to help you. Please let me"
12905,Damon, Where's John?
12906,Elena," He's not here, he left. I don't know where he went. He just blew in, announced to Jenna that he's my dad and then took off"
12907,Damon, It's public knowledge now?
12908,Elena, Apparently
12909,Damon, Are you okay?
12910,Elena, Yeah. Jenna's head spinning but I'm okay
12911,Damon, He said what he was doing here?
12912,Elena," No. you know, Stefan thinks that he's telling the truth about wanting to help me"
12913,Damon, do you believe him?
12914,Elena, No. I don't believe him for a second
12915,Damon, Me neither
12916,Elena, What are we gonna do?
12917,Damon, k*ll him
12918,Elena, Damon…
12919,Damon," I'm joking. Okay, I'm a little serious"
12920,Elena, Damon!
12921,Damon," I'm not gonna hurt him, Elena. I'm the good guy now, remember?"
12922,Elena, What does that mean?
12923,Damon, I'm gonna have a civil conversation with your father
12924,Elena," Wait, I'm coming with you"
12925,Stefan, I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to talk
12926,Tyler, Then why did you break in?
12927,Stefan, Would you have let me in otherwise?
12928,Carol, Tyler?
12929,Stefan, Shut. Not a word
12930,Carol, Tyler? I'm leaving for the memorial
12931,Jules, Brady?
12932,Jules, This is a hard place to find
12933,Brady, You told me to stand on the red alert
12934,Jules, Thanks for coming
12935,Brady, Are you sure these vamps k*ll Mason?
12936,Jules, Positive. You have to be careful
12937,Brady, I'm not afraid of a vampire
12938,Jules, I know baby but I want the boy more than I want vengeance
12939,Brady, Let's get both
12940,Stefan, Maybe we get off on the wrong foot here
12941,Tyler, What happened to Mason?
12942,Stefan," Tyler, there's a lot for us to talk about"
12943,Stefan, I wouldn't do that. Without a full moon you're not match for me
12944,Carol," It's good to have you back, John. We could really use you"
12945,John, And the council? What are they doing?
12946,Carol, Damon Salvatore is leading the council now. Talk to him
12947,John," Jeremy, there you are"
12948,Jeremy, Looks like I slept through the homecoming
12949,John, You didn't miss much. Let's say that no one's happy to see me would be an understatement
12950,Jeremy," Look, things are different now. You can't come around and start up with all this anti-vampire stuff"
12951,John, I have no intention of doing that. How's that ring been treating you?
12952,Jeremy," Look, if this is what you came for, just take it and go"
12953,John, What kind of a man would I be if I took that from you? You want to go grab some lunch?
12954,Jeremy, I think I'll pass
12955,Jonas, Hello Bonnie
12956,Bonnie," I don't have anything to say to you, Doctor Martin or your son"
12957,Jonas, You must be feeling very confused about us
12958,Bonnie, There's nothing confusing about it. I trusted Luka and he betrayed me. Elena told me you were working for Elijah so don't lie about it
12959,Jonas, I won't but that doesn't mean we're not also looking out for you
12960,Bonnie, Spare me the witch loyalty crap
12961,Jonas, You might don't want to believe this but Elijah is a man of his word. You can trust that he'll keep the end of his deal with Elena to keep you and your friends protected
12962,Bonnie," You're right, I don't believe it"
12963,Jeremy, Is there a problem here?
12964,Bonnie, not at all
12965,Jeremy, What was that about?
12966,Bonnie, More lies
12967,Jenna, I can't believe it. Elena is my sister's husband's brother's daughter and her mother is boyfriend's dead wife. You can't make this stuff up
12968,Alaric, It's definitely overwhelming
12969,Jenna, I can't believe that they keep it a secret. How is it even possible to keep a secret like that?
12970,John, Hey you two. Do you think I can join you?
12971,Jenna, Do you have to?
12972,John, I guess I don't have to but might as well
12973,Elena, We just need answers. Please don't do anything stupid
12974,Damon, Yeah but stupid is so much more fun
12975,Elena," Damon, I mean it. All I'm asking is you try to keep it together. Be a better man"
12976,Damon, Okay then
12977,Damon," John, buddy, how have you been?"
12978,John," I've been alright, Damon. It's good to see you"
12979,Stefan," Look, about Caroline, no matter what her flaws are, if an issue comes you'll want to have that girl on your side . She's your friend, stop being a dick to her"
12980,Tyler, I thought vampires hated werewolves
12981,Stefan," That's some sort of leftover idea from another time. It doesn't have to be that way anymore. We go to the same school. We have the same friends. We keep the same secrets. This can work, Tyler. I mean, it's your home, it's my home too. I want this to work"
12982,Tyler," Help, help!"
12983,Stefan, Who's number was that? Damn it Tyler! I'm trying to save your life. Can't you see that?
12984,Jules, We have a problem
12985,Damon," So John, rumor has it that you know a lot and won't say anything"
12986,John," How I know you can be trusted, Damon? Originals can compel vampires and according to Stefan, that's why Katherine's still in the tomb, because an original has compel her to stay there"
12987,Damon, Only because all of the vervein have left her system. Stefan and I on the other hand are chock full
12988,John, You guys are drinking vervein?
12989,Damon," It's an acquired taste. I don't see that magic little ring on that stitched finger so if you know something about Klaus, you better start talking or I will k*ll you in your sleep"
12990,John," Is that any way to convince me that you and I are on the same side? First, I need to know that I can trust you, Damon, that I can count on you. Then we'll talk"
12991,Matt, Hey! Hey!
12992,Caroline, Hey
12993,Matt, I haven't seen you
12994,Caroline," I'm not avoiding you, I swear"
12995,Matt, Yeah. You're avoiding me a little
12996,Caroline," Okay, maybe a little"
12997,Matt," Can we talk later? I mean, I'm heading to work right now but maybe after, to clear some of this weirdness"
12998,Caroline," Yeah, yeah, I'd really like that. I'll just swing by when you're closing?"
12999,Matt, Sounds good
13000,Caroline," Okay, bye"
13001,Jules," Excuse me, Caroline right?"
13002,Caroline, Yeah
13003,Jules," I'm looking for Tyler. You haven't seen him, have you?"
13004,Caroline," No, not since earlier. Sorry"
13005,Jules, I know you're lying
13006,Caroline, Really? How? Is that one of your little wolf tricks?
13007,Jules, Actually it is
13008,Caroline," Well, I have a trick too"
13009,Brady," I see you got the b*llet out. That was nasty. I got a lots of wooden b*ll*ts, other toys. It's gonna be a long night, sweet pea"
13010,Tyler," You want to be friends, great, we‘re friends. Will you go now?"
13011,Stefan," I don't know what else to say to you Tyler. I came back o this town because I wanted a life, I wanted to exist where I can have friends and where I can build a family. I have that here, we can both have that"
13012,Stefan, Hey. Is everything okay?
13013,Jules, That depends. How about you want to keep her alive
13014,Stefan, Who is this?
13015,Jules, Ask your brother. Where's Tyler?
13016,Stefan, Jules? Where's Caroline?
13017,Jules," You made a mistake, Stefan. I gonna give you a chance to fix it"
13018,Stefan, Where is she?
13019,Jules, right here. Want proof?
13020,Stefan, Hurt her again and you're dead
13021,Jules," I hurt her again and she's dead. Bring Tyler to me , the clearing by Wickery falls. You have 20 minutes until she dies"
13022,Jenna," So, my friend wants to meet you. Damon Salvatore, this is…"
13023,Damon, I know you. The news lady
13024,Andie," Yeah, Andie Star. Nice to meet you. Can I buy you a drink, Damon?"
13025,Damon," My glass is all full, Andie. Thank you"
13026,Elena, You totally blew her off
13027,Damon, I staying clear off all women at the moment
13028,Elena, You didn't have to be rude
13029,Damon," Trust me, it's on the best interest of women everywhere"
13030,Elena, Stefan? What is it?
13031,Damon, Why am I just finding out about this now?
13032,Elena, Stefan was worried that you…
13033,Damon," That I'll what? That I'd k*ll him? Of course, it's what's need to happen"
13034,Elena," No Damon, not Tyler. Do whatever you need to do to get Caroline back but just leave Tyler out of it, okay?"
13035,Damon," Why? He's a werewolf, he needs to die. I'm willing to k*ll him, it's win-win"
13036,Elena," Damon please, okay? Too many people are dead"
13037,Damon, You need to stop doing that
13038,Elena, Doing what?
13039,Damon, Assuming that I'll play the good guy because that you who's asking
13040,Elena," Be a better man, Damon"
13041,Damon, Do you mind?
13042,John, What's going on?
13043,Elena, Nothing
13044,John, It doesn't look like nothing
13045,Damon," well guess what John, trust works both ways. Get out"
13046,Elena," Look, we don't have time for this. We need to get Caroline back"
13047,Damon, We don't have to do anything. I'll take care of it
13048,Damon, First dad duty: ground your daughter. Keep her here
13049,Elena, I'm coming with you
13050,John," No, no, no, no, no. I'm with Damon on this one. No, stop, stop. You're not going anywhere. Just tell me what's going on"
13051,Brady," So, How many vampires are they in this town anyway?"
13052,Brady, No?
13053,Caroline, Why are you doing this to me?! Why are you doing this? Why?
13054,Brady, You're a vampire. Why not?
13055,Brady," I'm sorry, what was that?"
13056,Caroline, Let me out!
13057,Brady, Excuse me? What was that?
13058,Caroline, Let me out!
13059,Jules, Get it out of your system?
13060,Brady," No, I'm just getting started"
13061,Jules," Brady, let's be smart about this. I just want the boy. It's our duty to help him, it's who we are"
13062,Brady," You want to talk duty and honor? These are vampires. They cross one of us, they cross all of us. That's who we are"
13063,John, You're not leaving this restaurant
13064,Elena, You can't tell me what to do
13065,John, Yes I can. You want to know why? Because I'm here to make sure you stay safe
13066,Elena, I've got that covered
13067,John, Are you talking about the deal that you made with Elijah? Do you really think he's gonna keep this promise to you? Putting your faith in him was a dumb move
13068,Elena, Are you saying I should put my faith in you? After everything that you've done to Damon and Stefan?
13069,John," We had our difference and I've made mistakes but you and I , we're family"
13070,Elena, You don't get to use tat word. That word is off limits to you!
13071,John," Fine, but it doesn't't change the facts"
13072,Elena," You're right. Facts are facts so listen up: you may be my father but I'm never going to be your daughter, you got that?"
13073,Jules, I know you're out there
13074,Stefan, Where's Caroline?
13075,Jules, Locked up tight
13076,Stefan," Let her go and I release Tyler. The situation doesn't have to get any messier than it already has. I'm not your enemy, Jules"
13077,Jules," It's a little late to be waving the white flag, don't you think?"
13078,Stefan, You need to leave town. No one else has to get hurt
13079,Jules, I'm not leaving without Tyler
13080,Stefan, Tyler is free to make his own decisions as soon as you release Caroline
13081,Damon," My brother the peacemaker . Since Stefan got here before me I'm gonna let him try to his way before I resort to my way, which is a little bloodier so give us Caroline"
13082,Jules, Let go of Tyler
13083,Damon, Give us Caroline. Without a full moon it's not an even fight and you know it. We will take you
13084,Jules," I'm not so sure about that, tough guy"
13085,Jules, Let's try this again. Give us Tyler
13086,Damon, You heard her. Go. Get over there
13087,Brady, Which one of you k*ll Mason?
13088,Damon," Uh, that'd be me"
13089,Brady," Boys, make sure that one suffers"
13090,Damon, We can take them
13091,Stefan, I don't know about that
13092,Damon, Well then…
13093,Caroline," Tyler, there's a latch on the door and I can't get to it"
13094,Caroline, Tyler?
13095,Caroline," Tyler, please! Tyler?"
13096,Caroline, What's happening?
13097,Tyler, What the hell is going on?
13098,Jonas, Elijah made a promise to Elena. I'm here to see it's up held. You need to go. Get out of here. Now
13099,Jonas," When your friends are waken, give them a message: They need to get the hell out of this town"
13100,Stefan, So is your mom home?
13101,Caroline," No, she's at work"
13102,Stefan, I can come in if you want me to
13103,Caroline," I'm fine, Stefan"
13104,Stefan, You don't have to pretend with me. Anybody would be upset after what you went through tonight
13105,Caroline, I'm okay. I'm not girly little Caroline anymore. I can handle myself
13106,Stefan, Sure you can
13107,Caroline, I just really want to go shower so…
13108,Stefan, Okay
13109,Caroline, Good night
13110,Stefan, Good night
13111,Damon, What do you want?
13112,John, We haven't finish our conversation
13113,Damon, I'll bite
13114,John," I've been thinking. Personal feelings aside Damon, I think You and Stefan will do all you can to protect Elena"
13115,Damon, I agree with that statement
13116,John, So I come with gifts
13117,Damon, What is that?
13118,John," This is how you k*ll an original? In this vial, is ash from a white oak tree that dates back to the genesis of the originals. The dagger must be dipped into the ash and then plugged into their heart"
13119,Damon," How do you know all this, John?"
13120,John, Isobel. She's very good at finding out things but of course you know that
13121,Damon, Where is Isobel?
13122,John," Let's just say if she accomplishes what she's attempting, Klaus will never set foot in Mystic Falls. When Elena's concerned, you and I are on the same side"
13123,Caroline, Hi
13124,Matt, Hey. Did something happened?
13125,Caroline, Oh my… I'm so sorry Matt
13126,Matt, Are you okay?
13127,Caroline, Yeah. Something came up with Bonnie and she needed me. A friend thing. You understand?
13128,Matt, Yeah so you're with her right now?
13129,Caroline, Yeah so I'm not gonna make it tonight but can I see you tomorrow?
13130,Matt," Yeah, sure. I hope everything works out. Good night"
13131,Tyler, Are you okay?
13132,Caroline, I'm fine
13133,Tyler, I had no idea they would come for you
13134,Caroline, Do you know what they did to me?
13135,Tyler, I'm sorry but it's crazy now okay? I don't know who to trust. You lied to me
13136,Caroline, I lied to protect my friends. I lied to protect you. Don't you get that?
13137,Tyler, Caroline…
13138,Caroline, You just stood there when they were going to k*ll us. You just stood there! You didn't do anything!
13139,Tyler, I didn't know what to do!
13140,Caroline," You help your friends, that's what you do"
13141,Tyler, I'm sorry
13142,Caroline," No it's too late because we're not friends anymore and what happened to me tonight, that will never happen again so you take that back to your little werewolf pack and you get the hell out of my house!"
13143,John, I'm sorry about earlier
13144,Elena, Enough already. I don't want you here and I can't make that anymore clear
13145,John," I didn't come here to fight with you, Elena"
13146,Elena," yeah I know, you're here to protect me. Got it, get in line"
13147,John, I thought you might want this. It was you mother's
13148,Elena, Isobel?
13149,John," No, your mother, Miranda. I remember her wearing that when she was young. I found it in a box with some things that your dad left me. Here, it's yours now"
13150,John," Miranda and Grayson were your parents, Elena and I know I'm nothing to you. You have no reason to believe me or trust me. I've done so many horrible things but when you lost your parents, I lost my brother, my family. I lost my way. I know that won't probably never gonna make things right with you but I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you and protect this family"
13151,Elena, Are you okay?
13152,Stefan, I'm fine
13153,Elena," Did you hear that? I don't believe him, Stefan. I just don't. what happened tonight? How's Caroline?"
13154,Stefan, I could use your help
13155,Jules," Hey, come on in"
13156,Tyler, I'm sorry about your friends
13157,Tyler," It's not always like this, is it?"
13158,Jules, No. is it Brady?
13159,Brady," No men. You're living in a vampire country, that's all. It's way better than this"
13160,Tyler," Mason didn't tell me anything about it. He was gone. Dead I guess, before he could help me"
13161,Brady, I don't get why Mason was even doing here in the first place
13162,Jules, His brother died. You know that Brady
13163,Brady, Why was he stupid enough to stay and get himself k*ll?
13164,Tyler, Because of this rock he was trying to find
13165,Brady, What rock?
13166,Tyler, A moonstone
13167,Jules, I had no idea
13168,Tyler, What?
13169,Brady, A moonstone? Did he find it?
13170,Tyler, Yeah
13171,Brady, Where is it now?
13172,Tyler, I couldn't tell you
13173,Caroline, What's going on?
13174,Stefan, I was a little bit worried about you after everything you went through tonight
13175,Caroline, I'm fine
13176,Stefan," Good but just in case, I brought some back up"
13177,Elena, We're gonna slumber in
13178,Bonnie, We haven't done it in ages
13179,Andie, I can't believe you called me. I thought I was being way to forward when I had Jenna give you my number
13180,Damon, I like a woman who knows what she wants
13181,Andie," Thank you so what do you want mister tall, dark and handsome?"
13182,Damon, I'm not that tall. I need a distraction
13183,Andie, You can booty call me anytime you want
13184,Damon," You see, the thing is, miss sexy reporter, I have a problem I need help with. It's really messing with my mind"
13185,Andie," Oh, tell me about it"
13186,Damon, I'm in love with a woman I could never have
13187,Andie, I knew it. I know how to pick them. So why can't you have her? She's with another man I assume?
13188,Damon, Yeah but that's not the point. The point is I'm in love with her and that drive me crazy. I'm not in control.
13189,Andie, You don't trust yourself around her?
13190,Damon," I don't trust myself around anyone, Andie. I'm bad, Andie. I do things. I k*ll people"
13191,Damon," Don't be afraid, you're okay"
13192,Andie, Why do you k*ll people?
13193,Damon," because I like it. It's in my nature, it's who I am but then I have to stay together to protect her and she wants me to be a better man which means I can't be who I am. Do you see the problem I'm having, Andie?"
13194,Andie," Well, maybe this is who you are now. Love does that Damon, it changes us"
13195,Damon," Just stop talking. Just kiss me, be my distraction"
13196,John, I know you were expecting someone else
13197,Katherine, I sent Stefan to find Isobel
13198,John, She got your message. She was busy so she sent me instead
13199,Katherine, Does Stefan know that you're here right now?
13200,John," No. no one does. This is between you, me and Isobel"
13201,Katherine," I want to be out of this tomb, John"
13202,John, I'm already on it
13203,Brady, Go ahead. Tell her
13204,Stevie," Let me just preface this with a big disclaimer. that screams, ""I should have known better"""
13205,Jules," What is it, Stevie?"
13206,Stevie," When Brady told me what that Tyler kid said about Mason being here for the moonstone, something clicked. There was this moment back in Florida when I suspected Mason was up to something because he was banging that hot vampire chick Kathy and he didn't want anyone to know"
13207,Jules," All right. Just get to the point, Stevie"
13208,Stevie," That is the point, Jules. It's the sun and moon curse. Mason was asking me all kinds of questions about it: if it could be broken, and when that evil man-witch showed up last night, double-click. Witches, vampires, moonstone. They're putting everything in place to break the curse"
13209,Brady," We can't let them do that, even if we have to k*ll every last vampire in this town"
13210,Stefan, How was the slumber party?
13211,Elena, Good and Much needed. When can you and I have one?
13212,Stefan, That can be arranged
13213,Elena," Okay. Now. Today. Take me far, far away"
13214,Stefan, Even with everything that's going on?
13215,Elena, Because of everything that's going on
13216,Stefan, And you're sure this has nothing to do with dodging your father who just got into town?
13217,Elena," Uh, this has everything to do with that"
13218,Stefan," Well, in that case, where would you like to go?"
13219,Andie," I'm late, This is such a crazy day. I'm, uh, covering the historical society's high tea"
13220,Damon, Ooh! Thrilling
13221,Andie, Yeah. It's for some visiting writer. He's writing a book on small-town Virginia. It's a big snooze.
13222,Damon, Writer? What's his name?
13223,Andie," Uh, Elijah Smith"
13224,Damon, Smith. He's using Smith?
13225,Damon," Ok. You have your story straight in your mind, right?"
13226,Andie," I can't say that you bit me or drank my bl*od, just that we hit it off and I really like you. You are terrific, though. You're sweet, funny, you're honest."
13227,Damon, And you're falling hard
13228,Andie, You might be the one
13229,Damon, Perfect
13230,Damon," Perfect. Have a great day, honey"
13231,Andie," Oh. Hey, Alaric. Later"
13232,Damon," My new girlfriend, Andie star, action news"
13233,Alaric, It's not called action news
13234,Damon, I know. I just like saying it. Come on
13235,Damon, So John Gilbert gave me this to k*ll Elijah
13236,Damon," Said you have to dip the dagger in the remains of an old white ash tree that dates back to the originals, if there's any truth in that"
13237,Alaric, So you think it's a setup?
13238,Damon, It could be. Guy's a weasel. Wouldn't put anything past him
13239,Damon," What are you up to today, Mr. Saltzman?"
13240,Alaric," Well, Jenna and I were supposed to go to her family's lake house, but somehow, we both got roped into doing this historical society thing at the Lockwood's"
13241,Damon, Where Elijah's the guest of honor
13242,Alaric, Tell me you're not gonna k*ll him at the tea party
13243,Damon, No. That would be stupid. I want to know his endgame before I k*ll him but I do think it's time Elijah and I officially met
13244,Caroline, Ok. So tell me about this big witchy plan you've been cooking up
13245,Bonnie, We still don't know the extent of what Elijah's up to
13246,Caroline," No, we don't"
13247,Bonnie, So I'm gonna ask Luka to tell me what he knows
13248,Caroline, And he's not gonna tell you anything
13249,Bonnie, I didn't say he was gonna have a choice
13250,Bonnie, What's that about?
13251,Caroline," Uh, I don't know. I thought that we were... I don't know"
13252,Jules," Tyler, hi"
13253,Tyler, You're still here
13254,Jules, Is that all right with you?
13255,Tyler, That guy last night made it pretty clear you needed to go
13256,Jules, And we will soon
13257,Jules, Listen. We kind of need your help with something
13258,Brady, We need you to help us find the moonstone
13259,Tyler, Somebody needs to explain to me what the big deal is about a rock
13260,Stevie, That rock helps break the curse of the sun and the moon
13261,Tyler, I don't know what that means
13262,Jules, It's an old curse placed on both vampires and werewolves
13263,Stevie," Vampires break the curse, they're free to walk in the sunlight but we're stuck only turning at the full moon, aka werewolf Armageddon"
13264,Brady," But if we break it, they're stuck as night-walkers, and we can turn whenever we want"
13265,Stevie, Aka werewolf domination
13266,Jules," Tyler, if we can turn at will, that means we never have to turn at all, not if we don't want to"
13267,Tyler, I'd never have to turn again?
13268,Brady, There's more. Stevie?
13269,Stevie," If those vamps are gearing up to break the curse, they must have also found the doppelganger"
13270,Tyler, The doppelganger?
13271,Stevie," Evil twin shadow person. We're betting Mason's hot vampire chick Kathy knows all about it, so we need you to help us find Kathy. I have a picture. Mason brought her to the bar once. No one liked her. She was a vampire. Bad news"
13272,Stevie," Right, right here. The girl next to Mason"
13273,Tyler, That's Elena Gilbert
13274,Jules, You know her?
13275,Tyler, I've known her my whole life
13276,Matt, I'm…i'm working
13277,Caroline, Yeah I can see that but can you work and talk?
13278,Matt," What do you want, Caroline?"
13279,Caroline," Uh, I want to talk about what we were supposed to talk about last night before I had to cancel on you. I want us to clear up the weirdness. I just want us to talk about us"
13280,Matt, Now you're just making it worse
13281,Caroline," Uh, I…I don't know what's going on, Matt"
13282,Matt, Where were you last night when you were supposed to be with me?
13283,Caroline, I…
13284,Matt," And don't say you were with Bonnie because bonnie was here, Caroline. I saw her"
13285,Caroline, Oh
13286,Matt, Yeah
13287,Tyler, Caroline
13288,Caroline, You stay away from me
13289,Tyler, It's important
13290,Caroline," Just stop it, Tyler, ok? You're just…you're just making it worse"
13291,Tyler," Please, Caroline. I'm sorry about what happened, ok? but there's so much we need to talk about"
13292,Caroline, I said just leave me alone
13293,Matt," The two of you want to get together, fine. There's nothing I can do about it but do me a favor, and both of you stop lying about it"
13294,Tyler," Matt, there's nothing going on"
13295,Matt, Hey! I said stop lying!
13296,Stefan, Are you ready for our romantic weekend?
13297,Elena, Beyond ready. Let's go before John shows up and pretends to be a concerned father
13298,Stefan, Mmm. I'll go put these in the car
13299,Stefan," Uh, please tell me there's nothing wrong"
13300,Elena, Nothing's wrong. Just Caroline. Come on. Let's go
13301,Tyler, She's going to Dunham lake. Her family has a house up there
13302,Brady, Nice. Let's go get our doppelganger
13303,Stefan, You all right?
13304,Elena, I'm good. I just haven't been back here since before…
13305,Stefan," Oh, my god. Elena, listen. Just say the word, all right? We'll get back on that highway, we'll go anywhere else"
13306,Elena," I've always loved it here. I want it to stay that way, I was just... having a moment"
13307,Stefan, Okay
13308,Elena, You don't have to wait out there. I'm all good
13309,Stefan," Oh, that's great because I'm, uh... I'm stuck"
13310,Elena," Oh, my god. You can't get in"
13311,Stefan," Not gonna be a very romantic weekend unless you, uh, invite me inside"
13312,Elena," Stefan, I can't"
13313,Stefan, What?
13314,Elena, My parent's left this place to John Gilbert. He's the only one who can invite you in. I'm sorry. I completely forgot
13315,Stefan," You're kidding me, right?"
13316,Elena," Stefan Salvatore, I hereby invite you into this home"
13317,Stefan, You are such a liar
13318,Elena," Hey, hey, hey!"
13319,Carol, Have you spent much time in Richmond for your book? There's such a wealth of history there
13320,Elijah, No. I'm focusing mostly on the smaller regions of Virginia. Lots of research. Strictly academic
13321,Carol, That's fascinating
13322,Jenna," Damon, what are you doing here?"
13323,Andie, Hi. You came
13324,Damon, Hi
13325,Andie, Hi
13326,Damon," Thanks for introducing us, Jenna"
13327,Carol, Damon
13328,Damon, Carol
13329,Carol," What a surprise. Elijah, I want you to meet Damon Salvatore. His family is one of mystic falls' founding families"
13330,Damon, Such a pleasure to meet you
13331,Elijah, No. Pleasure's mine
13332,Bonnie, Come bearing coffee gifts
13333,Luka, So you're talking to me now
13334,Bonnie," I found out what your dad did, saving my friends from the wolf pack"
13335,Luka," Well, had I known that's all it took..."
13336,Jeremy, Hey. How's it going?
13337,Caroline, What are you doing here?
13338,Jeremy, Bonnie called. I wanted to help. How's it going?
13339,Caroline," She's selling it, and he's buying it. She's giving him the sex smile"
13340,Jeremy," All right, Caroline. I get it"
13341,Luka, What do you say? You want to play a game?
13342,Bonnie, Yeah
13343,Luka, Yeah?
13344,Bonnie, Yeah
13345,Luka, What's happening to me?
13346,Bonnie, You'll be ok
13347,Bonnie, Why don't we go over here?
13348,Jeremy," I got him, I got him"
13349,Jeremy, What kind of witch roofie was that?
13350,Bonnie, Strong one
13351,Stefan, Having another moment?
13352,Elena," Jeremy broke his arm diving off this dock when he was 6. My dad taught me how to fish Right off the edge up there. So many memories. Do you ever think about us, What our future will be like, our memories?"
13353,Stefan," I think there are long conversations to be head about our future, about the kind of life we could have together"
13354,Elena, Now there's a box that we shouldn't open
13355,Stefan," Oh, we can open it. Whenever you're ready"
13356,Elena, No. I'd rather just be here...Now
13357,Stefan," You know, this is a future memory. It's where your boyfriend whispered to you that he loved you. I love you"
13358,John, What's Damon doing with Elijah?
13359,Alaric, How would I know?
13360,John, Because you're his little helper
13361,Alaric," If you say so, John"
13362,John," Does Jenna know about your extracurricular activities? Maybe it's time we tell her. I mean, she can't stay in the dark forever"
13363,Alaric, You're a dick
13364,John," I don't think you should sleep over anymore. It's inappropriate with children in the house, and that ring that Isobel gave you, that's mine. I'm gonna want that back."
13365,Elijah," What can I do for you, Damon?"
13366,Damon, I was hoping we could have a word
13367,Elijah, Where's Elena?
13368,Damon," Safe with Stefan. They're laying low, you know, bit of a werewolf problem"
13369,Elijah," Oh, yeah. I heard about that"
13370,Damon, I'm sure you did since it was your witch that saved the day
13371,Elijah, You are welcome
13372,Damon, Which adds to my confusion on exactly why you're here
13373,Elijah, Why don't you just stay focused on keeping Elena safe and leave the rest to me
13374,Damon, Not good enough
13375,Elijah," You young vampires, so arrogant. How dare you come in here and challenge me?"
13376,Damon," You can't k*ll me, man. It's not part of the deal"
13377,Elijah, Silence
13378,Elijah," I'm an original. Show a little respect. The moment you cease to be of use to me, you're dead, so you should do what I say. Keep Elena safe"
13379,Elena," My dad did all the cooking, too"
13380,Stefan, And your mom?
13381,Elena, She sat right here and watched. She couldn't cook either
13382,Elena, Fire's dying
13383,Stefan," Oh, yeah. I'll go get more wood"
13384,Elena, I got it
13385,Stefan," No, no. It's cold outside"
13386,Elena, So I'll get a jacket
13387,Elena," My mom's perfume. Jenna was supposed to pack all this up, but... she kept putting it off. I don't blame her"
13388,Elena, Here
13389,Elena, Bundle up
13390,Elena, It was my great granddad's and you look very hot in it
13391,Stefan, I look hot in your dead great granddad's jacket?
13392,Elena, Beyond hot
13393,Elena, Stefan! It's my parents' bedroom
13394,Elena, What?
13395,Elena, What?
13396,Stefan, This is hollow inside
13397,Elena, What is it?
13398,Stefan, It's a really good hiding place
13399,Elena," Oh, my god"
13400,Caroline," We only have, like, an hour or two before my mom gets home"
13401,Caroline, And these are all I could find
13402,Bonnie, Place these evenly around the room
13403,Jeremy, How does this work?
13404,Bonnie," Um, I'll put him in a trance and ask him questions. It's like hypnosis"
13405,Jeremy, You sure you're strong enough for this?
13406,Bonnie, That's what the candles are for. I'll draw power from the flames
13407,Caroline, I'll get the matches
13408,Bonnie, I got it
13409,Jeremy, Never gonna get used to that
13410,Caroline," Oh, come on. That's pretty hot, and you know it"
13411,Bonnie, In need a bowl of water
13412,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah. I'll go get it"
13413,Bonnie," Ok. What was that? ""It's hot""?"
13414,Caroline, He is so crushing on you
13415,Bonnie, So?
13416,Caroline," So… What, you'd rather be with traitor warlock over here?"
13417,Bonnie," I'm not into Luka. It's just, you know, he understood me, and he was new and different"
13418,Caroline," And you've known Jeremy since forever, and you only see him one way, as Elena's brother but you're a witch, and I'm a vampire. You know, it's not like we're in any position…"
13419,Bonnie, to be picky
13420,Caroline," No, to judge"
13421,Jeremy, Looks like he's waking up
13422,Damon, Today was a bust
13423,Alaric, Yeah. How's the throat?
13424,Damon, Sore
13425,Alaric, Yeah. That Elijah's one scary dude but with nice hair. Hey. You want another one?
13426,Damon, He's gonna be hard to k*ll
13427,Alaric, Yeah. I'd think twice before I'd trust that dagger and some ashes to do the job. You're gonna need more info
13428,Damon, I'm out of sources
13429,Alaric, What's up with you and this news chick?
13430,Damon," She's got spunk, huh?"
13431,Alaric," Just don't k*ll her, please"
13432,Damon," If I did, who would report her death?"
13433,Alaric," Just don't do it, all right? She's friends with Jenna, and it's bad enough that I'm lying to her about everything else. I hate the lies"
13434,Alaric," Oh, god. I got to go. I got to pick Jenna up. Don't worry. I'll, uh, show myself out"
13435,Damon, Good luck
13436,Stevie," Whew! Damn, you're strong. It took the whole syringe"
13437,Stevie, Grab that one. He's dead
13438,Jules," Hi, Damon. Nice to see you again"
13439,Elena," These must be the other Jonathan Gilbert journals. Jeremy had the one, but John said that there were others. His whole life's in here"
13440,Stefan, I'll go get the firewood. I'll let you have a moment
13441,Brady, We're good to go. You up for this?
13442,Brady," These people have done nothing but lie to you. This girl that you've known since birth, she's with the vampires now, the ones who k*ll Mason. They're the enemy, and if they break that curse, well... all of us are as good as dead. Are you up for this?"
13443,Tyler, Yes
13444,Brady," Good Because if you woos out, you're gonna have me to deal with, You got it?"
13445,John, Where's Elena?
13446,Jenna, At the lake house for the weekend
13447,John, With Stefan?
13448,Jenna," Yes, with Stefan"
13449,John, And who gave her permission for that?
13450,Jenna," I did. Until you get a lawyer, file for guardianship, it's my call, and there's nothing you can do about it"
13451,John, I always knew you were lax with them but I didn't think you were negligent
13452,Jenna," She wanted to get away from you, ok, and so do I, so I'll be staying with Rick"
13453,John," Because he's such a great guy, right?"
13454,Jenna, You are on dangerous ground
13455,John," He's a liar, Jenna"
13456,Jenna, What?
13457,john, Did he ever tell you what happened to his wife?
13458,Jenna, She died
13459,John, Really? So they found her body?
13460,Jenna, What are you saying?
13461,John, Why don't you ask Rick? I'd love to hear his answer. Have a great night
13462,Stevie," Morning, sunshine. I saw this movie once, some torture p*rn flick. Anyway, they had this collar device that was really cool, so I just modified it some with some wooden nails, and when I pull..."
13463,Jules, So I hear you have the moonstone
13464,Damon," Oh, if you only knew the irony of this moment right now. Let me tell you how this is gonna go. You're gonna torture me, I don't talk, Someone loses a heart. Last time, it was your boy Mason"
13465,Jules," This time, it will be you"
13466,Caroline, How long is this gonna take?
13467,Bonnie, I don't know. He's fighting me
13468,Luka, Please stop. Please
13469,Bonnie, There. All right. Why are you working with Elijah?
13470,Luka, Klaus. We both want him dead
13471,Bonnie," You want to k*ll Klaus, too. Why?"
13472,Luka, Because he has her and we have to get her away from him
13473,Bonnie, Who… who are you talking about?
13474,Luka, My sister
13475,Bonnie, Sister? Why does he have her?
13476,Luka, He's searching for a way to undo the curse without the doppelganger. He's forced generations of witches to help him for centuries
13477,Bonnie, What has Elijah promised you?
13478,Luka," If we help Elijah k*ll Klaus, He's promised to return her to us"
13479,Bonnie, And how do you k*ll Klaus? How do you k*ll an original vampire?
13480,Luka, He'll k*ll me if I tell you. Don't make me
13481,Jeremy," It's ok, Bonnie. We can find another way"
13482,Bonnie, No. How will you k*ll Klaus?
13483,Luka," After the sacrifice, Klaus will be vulnerable, weak. It's our only chance"
13484,Caroline, After the sacrifice?
13485,Bonnie," What do you mean, after?"
13486,Luka, Klaus will be vulnerable
13487,Bonnie, But Elena will be dead
13488,Luka, Yes. Elena has to die
13489,Jeremy, No
13490,Brady, Keep him down. If he moves... k*ll him
13491,Tyler, Don't move!
13492,Stefan, Just let me get the b*llet out It punctured my heart. I need to get it out. I'm not gonna fight you
13493,Tyler, I don't think so
13494,Stefan," Tyler, why are you doing this?"
13495,Tyler, I can't let you break the curse
13496,Stefan, You know about the curse?
13497,Tyler," You're liars, all of you"
13498,Stefan," No. I swear to you. We don't want to break the curse, Tyler. We don't want to do that"
13499,Tyler, Oh yeah? But I do. I can't be like this forever
13500,Stefan," Tyler, I'm just trying to save Elena"
13501,Tyler, Elena will be fine!
13502,Stefan," They didn't tell you that part, did they? Who are the liars now?"
13503,Tyler, Tell me what?
13504,Stefan," In order to break the curse, Elena has to die"
13505,Elena, Are you growing the trees out there? Stefan?
13506,Elena," Stefan, what are you doing out there?"
13507,Brady, I can smell you
13508,Stefan, It's OK. It's OK. You're OK. You're OK. You're all right. It's OK
13509,Elena, Tyler?
13510,Tyler," I didn't know what they were gonna do to you. I didn't. I just... I didn't want to be like this anymore. I'm sorry, Elena"
13511,Elena, It's okay
13512,Jules," You know what the great thing about buckshot is? It scatters through the body, maximum damage. Where's the moonstone?"
13513,Damon," Get over it, honey. You're never gonna get it"
13514,Elijah, You looking for this?
13515,Elijah, Go ahead. Take it
13516,Elijah," What about you, sweetheart, hmm? You want to take a sh*t? Yes, no, yes? Where's the girl?"
13517,Damon, I don't know
13518,Elijah, It doesn't really matter
13519,Elijah, So you realize this is the third time I've saved your life now?
13520,Damon, So he planned to k*ll her all along
13521,Bonnie, Yeah. The sacrifice is part of Elijah's plan
13522,Damon, Got it loud and clear
13523,Damon, Finally. You missed all the fun
13524,Jenna, There you are. Are you OK?
13525,Alaric," Yeah, sorry. I… I… I've just been grading papers. Honestly, uh... I fell asleep. I'm sorry. Jenna, I'm a jerk"
13526,Jenna, No. It's fine. I'm just glad you're OK
13527,Alaric," Sorry. Tomorrow I'm all yours, OK?"
13528,Jenna, Sure. Sounds great
13529,Alaric," All right. Good night, Jenna"
13530,Jenna, Good night
13531,Damon, It was straight from the witch's mouth. He was gonna go through with the whole sacrifice. You should probably just keep her away a little longer
13532,Stefan, Be careful. Try not to get yourself k*ll
13533,Damon, Yeah. It's been a day for that
13534,Stefan," That was, um…that was Damon. We need to talk"
13535,Elena, What is it?
13536,Stefan, He learned that Elijah's planning for you to die in the sacrifice ritual
13537,Elena," I know the deal I made, Stefan. Elijah's very careful with his words. He promised to protect my friends. He never said a word about me"
13538,Stefan," You mean, you knew that you weren't gonna survive this?"
13539,Elena," If it comes down to the people that I love getting k*ll or me, I know what my choice is gonna be"
13540,Stefan," Elena, how…how could you stand out there earlier with me, talking about making plans for our future, when you don't even expect to have one?"
13541,Elena," I'm sorry, Stefan. I'm just trying to keep the people that I love safe. I'm trying to keep you safe"
13542,Stefan, No. What you're doing is you're being a martyr
13543,Elena, How is that any different from when you say that you would die to keep me safe?
13544,Stefan," Because I've already lived. 162 years I have lived, and you've barely g*n, and now you want to let yourself get k*ll? That's not heroic. It's tragic"
13545,Jeremy, So will Luka remember anything?
13546,Bonnie," No. He'll know he lost consciousness, that's all"
13547,Jeremy, Should we wait for Caroline?
13548,Bonnie, She was just gonna drop Luka back at the Grill. Said to lock the door on our way out
13549,Jeremy," Yeah. Well, I hope she drops him hard"
13550,Bonnie," Wait. You're Elena's little brother, I've known you forever. You're that punk kid. I remember your awkward phase and then your emo phase, Your druggie phase and overnight, you turned into this hot guy who's really sweet and…"
13551,Jeremy, You think I'm hot?
13552,Bonnie," With everything that's going on, you know, curses and sacrifice..."
13553,Jeremy, Enough already
13554,Carol, Hello? Hello?
13555,Tyler, Matt
13556,Matt," I'm not in the mood, man"
13557,Tyler, I need to say something
13558,Matt, All right. Say it
13559,Tyler," I've been going through a rough time, something I can't really talk about, and Caroline's been helping me through it. She's been there for me more than anyone's ever been there my entire life, and I kind of fell for her. I don't know how anyone wouldn't because she's pretty incredible. But she loves you, and she needs you and to be honest, she deserves someone like you. So you be good to her, OK?"
13560,Matt," Yeah, man. Of course"
13561,Tyler," See you around, Matt"
13562,Matt, Yeah
13563,Caroline, Mom?
13564,Tyler," I'm sorry about Brady and your friends but if I'm gonna go with you, no more lies"
13565,Jules, No more lies. You're doing the right thing
13566,Tyler," I can't stay here, not like this"
13567,Jonathan," With the dying embers of the fire at Fell's church, the scourge of the vampires had passed. And though w*r raged all around us, our town was safe from the demons of the night... Or so we thought. For the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths had begat new monsters."
13568,Honoria, Did you hear that?
13569,Thomas, Stay here
13570,Honoria," No, Thomas"
13571,Thomas," It's all right, dear, the vampires are all dead"
13572,Jonathan," Yes, Honoria... they b*rned in the church. We're safe now"
13573,Honoria," Please, Jonathan. I'm worried"
13574,Jonathan, Very well. I shall go too
13575,Jonathan, I can prove there are no vampires
13576,Jonathan, See?
13577,Jonathan, Thomas? Thomas?!
13578,Honoria, Thomas!
13579,Jonathan," No, stay inside! Get back in the house!"
13580,Jonathan, I knew I was about to die. You can not run from a vampire. I saw the vampire who k*ll me. I recognized him. Stefan Salvatore
13581,Stefan, What's going on?
13582,Damon," Well, I showered. I shaved. Had breakfast. Very relaxed"
13583,Stefan, That makes one of us
13584,Damon, I did hear one piece of good news though. Tyler Lockwood ran away from home last night.
13585,Stefan, How do you know?
13586,Damon," Well, I heard it from sheriff Forbes, who heard it from a very distraught Carol Lockwood, thus, ending our werewolf chapter, bringing us to..."
13587,Stefan, ...k*ll Elijah
13588,Damon, Exactly
13589,Stefan," Well, it's not going to be easy. He's crafty"
13590,Damon," Well, I've got a crafty little dagger"
13591,Stefan, He's an Original. We don't know what all that encompasses
13592,Damon," Oh, trust me, Stefan. I'm gonna dot all my t's. I don't want any surprises"
13593,Stefan," Wow, Damon, tell me you're actually gonna be careful for once"
13594,Damon," Yes, Stefan, I've become you. How tragic for both of us. Got to run. I've a m*rder to plan. Busy day"
13595,Jenna, The old Fell property actually starts just beyond that fence
13596,Elijah," Ah, the Fells... one of the Founding Families"
13597,Jenna, Why do you say it like that?
13598,Elijah," My research showed me that this area was actually settled almost two full centuries earlier. It was a migration of townsfolk from the northeast, um, it was Salem, to be precise"
13599,Jenna, Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?
13600,Elijah, Which means the ever lauded founding families... They didn't actually found anything
13601,Jenna," Well, I bet it was the men who made a big deal about being founders back in 1860. Men are very territorial"
13602,Elijah," Yes, they are"
13603,Jenna," Elijah, this is my friend, Alaric Saltzman"
13604,Alaric," Yeah, I got your message about walking Elijah here through the old property lines. I thought I would tag along. You know being a history buff and all. Where to next?"
13605,Elijah," I'm pretty curious about the freed slave property owners. Some say, you know, the descendents of the slaves are the true keepers of American history"
13606,Jenna," Well, I only brought the surveys. I got the list in the car. just give me a sec"
13607,Elijah, Alaric Saltzman. So you're one of those people on Elena's list of loved ones to protect
13608,Alaric, So is Jenna
13609,Elijah," You don't have to be jealous. I don't really pursue younger women. It's a joke, Ric, lighten up"
13610,Alaric, Right
13611,Jeremy," Hey, whatcha doin'?"
13612,Bonnie, Thinking about last night
13613,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah. Me, too"
13614,Bonnie, It was a tough spell. I could feel it draining me. I need practice
13615,Jeremy," Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know… Maybe you should come over tonight. We can practice. Get stronger"
13616,Bonnie," Yeah, sure. Thanks"
13617,Jeremy," Ah, incoming"
13618,Luka, You want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?
13619,Bonnie, Sorry?
13620,Luka, Don't play dumb. You both were here and...
13621,Jeremy, And?
13622,Luka, And that's all I remember. One minute I'm playing pool and the next I'm waking up in a bathroom stall
13623,Bonnie," Sorry, Luka, but everything seemed normal yesterday. I brought you a coffee and we played pool"
13624,Luka," See, I think you're lying"
13625,Jeremy, And I think you need to back off
13626,Elena, Are you still mad?
13627,Stefan," Yeah, I'm still mad"
13628,Elena," We had a difference of opinion, Stefan, we're not always gonna agree on everything"
13629,Stefan," Elena, you've agreed to sacrifice yourself to Klaus. To say that we have a difference of opinion is the understatement of the century"
13630,Elena, You would know
13631,Stefan, What does Jonathan Gilbert have to say?
13632,Elena, A lot. It's insane the things he wrote in his journal that he kept from the founding families. Stuff that nobody knows. Stuff that... You never told me
13633,Stefan," We were, uh... We were angry at the founding families for what they did to Katherine. We wanted revenge. I didn't know about Jonathan Gilbert's ring yet. I didn't know that he would... that he would survive"
13634,Elena, He describes you as a monster
13635,Stefan," That's what I was. I want you to know the truth... But I want you to hear it from me. In the weeks after I became a vampire, I relished in it. I took it to the darkest place I could"
13636,Stefan, Who wants to die next?
13637,Woman 1," Me, I'm next"
13638,Woman 2," Me, you promised me"
13639,Stefan," What about you? You know if you don't pick up the tempo, you're going to lose your head. Snap. Snap"
13640,Damon," Company, brother?"
13641,Stefan, I brought enough to share
13642,Damon, Are you mad bringing them here when the entire town is hunting us?
13643,Stefan," Damon, if you're worried about the founding families, please don't be. They're all dead or about to be"
13644,Damon, Leave this place. Never think of it again
13645,Damon, Same for you. Leave this place. Never think of it again
13646,Stefan," Damon, don't be like this. I'm just having some fun"
13647,Damon," Staying alive is more fun, Stefan. We have to be more careful than this. More clever. Like Katherine was"
13648,Stefan, Look what that got her
13649,Damon, I'm done here. With you. I'm leaving town
13650,Stefan," You hate me. I know. I know. An eternity of misery and on and on. I know, but you don't have to leave town. Damon, I'll do better. I promise"
13651,Damon," No, you will get us k*ll. I'd rather leave you to do that to yourself."
13652,Stefan," I wasn't myself then. I was full of guilt. What I did to my father, to my brother. I had to turn it off. It was the only way I could survive"
13653,Elena, It sounds like you were Damon
13654,Stefan, I was worse
13655,Damon," Other than the lecture on the history of Mystic Falls, did you get anything out of Elijah?"
13656,Alaric," No, it was boring. Of course, Jenna thinks he's charming"
13657,Damon, You sounded jealous. Sound a bit jealous?
13658,Andie, Kinda do
13659,Alaric, Maybe we shouldn't talk about this here
13660,Damon," Andie, she's been compelled not to divulge my secrets. Haven't you?"
13661,Andie, Uh-huh. Mmm. My lips are sealed
13662,Alaric, This is too weird
13663,Damon, I just need the right opportunity
13664,Damon," Ah, there's Jenna with her new boyfriend. Hi"
13665,Jenna," Hey, guys"
13666,Damon, So I hear you two had quite a meeting of historical minds today
13667,Jenna," Yeah, I guess you could say that."
13668,Alaric," Well, as much as I'd love to continue this, I've got papers to grade"
13669,Andie," No, you know what? We should continue this. Let's have a dinner party"
13670,Damon," Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas. I'll be happy to host. Say tonight. Maybe?"
13671,Andie, It's good for me. Jenna?
13672,Alaric, I don't know if tonight works...
13673,Jenna, I'm free
13674,Elijah, It'd be a pleasure
13675,Damon, Great
13676,Damon, Great. Drink up. Good girl
13677,Damon," I've come bearing gifts. I didn't have time to properly shop, but I did get a couple of things. Hmm?"
13678,Damon," Wow, that bl*od did the trick. You're almost pretty again"
13679,Katherine," What is it you want, Damon?"
13680,Damon," Guess who's back in town? Your old friend, John Gilbert"
13681,Katherine, Really. Why?
13682,Damon," Says he loves his daughter, Wants to protect her from Elijah and big, bad Klaus"
13683,Katherine, Touching
13684,Damon," Yeah, right. He told me this old wives tale about how to k*ll an Original"
13685,Katherine," And you want to know if it's true. If it was, I wouldn't tell you"
13686,Damon," Now, why not? I mean, you want Elijah and Klaus dead as much as I do"
13687,Katherine," Klaus, yes. Elijah, no. He's compelled me to stay in here. If he dies, I'm stuck forever"
13688,Damon, Sucks for you
13689,Katherine," Forget it, Damon. k*ll Elijah would be a su1c1de mission. You can't do it"
13690,Damon, Can so
13691,Katherine, Can't
13692,Damon, Even with a dagger and a little white oak ash?
13693,Katherine," No. Damon, if you k*ll Elijah, then I'm stuck in here forever"
13694,Damon, You're really scared
13695,Katherine, Just get me out of here first and then I'll help you. I'll... I'll help you k*ll Elijah or... or protect Elena. Whatever you want
13696,Damon, I get you out of here and your ass is sipping Klaus-free margaritas on some unknown island somewhere. No way
13697,Katherine," That's not true. I'll stay. Damon, please just don't do it"
13698,Damon," Well, thank you, you've told me everything I need to know"
13699,Katherine, I've told you nothing
13700,Damon," You have. You have indeed confirmed that it is possible to k*ll an Original, which I will do tonight. Guess who's coming to dinner?"
13701,stefan," For weeks I kept spiraling. I was completely driven by the desire for bl*od. Hunt, prey, k*ll. That was all I knew"
13702,Elena, How come no one caught on to what you were doing?
13703,Stefan," Mmm. There was a w*r going on. The thing about wartime. Endless, anonymous bl*od supply"
13704,Lexi, Ah! What kind of an idiot are you?
13705,Stefan," Alexia Branson, as she was known back then"
13706,Elena, Lexi? Your best friend Lexi? That's how you met her? What was she even doing in Mystic Falls?
13707,Stefan," She had heard it was a good place for vampires. You know, had no idea that they'd all been massacred. Needed a place to crash, so I brought her home with me"
13708,Lexi," I'd say it isn't necessary to take me in, but you did try to eat me and well, with dawn coming, beggars can't be choosers. Or should they be?"
13709,Stefan," I, um...I meant to dispose of those"
13710,Lexi," My God, you're a ripper"
13711,Stefan, A what?
13712,Lexi, There are good parts of being a vampire and there are bad parts. You're the bad parts. Well... we're going to have to change that
13713,Elena, Are you okay?
13714,Stefan, Talking about her brings up things I'd rather forget
13715,Elena, Like Damon k*ll her?
13716,Andie, So what's going on with you and Alaric? I feel like there's some tension
13717,Jenna," I don't know. I really like him. It's more than like and I want it to work, but I can't help but feel that he's hiding something from me. And then I've got John whispering things in my ear about him"
13718,Andie, Like what?
13719,Jenna," Things I don't want to believe. Things I don't believe, not if they're coming from John's mouth"
13720,Andie," Oh. Well, there you go, then. Trust is the key to any relationship. I mean, I am so grateful that Damon tells me everything"
13721,Alaric, This is a bad idea
13722,Damon, There's no such thing as a bad idea. Just poorly executed awesome ones. Here
13723,Alaric, No. I don't like the idea of Elijah being in the same house with Jenna
13724,Damon," Jenna's perfectly safe. Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission. It's totally harmless"
13725,Alaric, Just a fact-finding mission
13726,Damon, Yeah
13727,Alaric," Listen, no sneak attacks. No surprise plans. Nothing that's gonna put Jenna in harm's way. Ok?"
13728,Damon, Scout's honor
13729,Andie," Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine"
13730,Andie, What's that?
13731,Damon, Dessert
13732,Damon, Elijah's stronger than me. Faster than me. It's all about the element of surprise
13733,Andie," Ah, it's too bad. I like him. He's very old-school. Classy"
13734,Damon, Which is why you should encourage the gentlemen to take their after dinner drinks in here while you do coffee in the kitchen with the girls
13735,Andie, Hmm. That is a little too sexist for me
13736,Damon, Stop talking
13737,Jenna, Who invited him?
13738,Damon, John! Surprise... Leave
13739,John," When Jenna told me she was coming to a dinner party for Elijah, I decided I couldn't miss out on all the fun and games"
13740,Alaric," There are not going to be any games tonight, John. It's just a friendly dinner party"
13741,Damon, What he said
13742,Jeremy, Hey
13743,Bonnie, Hey
13744,Bonnie, Thanks. That thing weighs a ton. I'm starving. You guys have any... food?
13745,Bonnie," Oh, God. Heh! This is a date"
13746,Jeremy," No, no it's not like a date, date. More of a hey, I kissed you, and I thought you liked it, um... hang thing"
13747,Bonnie," Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena is cool with this before anything else happens"
13748,Jeremy, I didn't realize my sister had approval over who I'm with
13749,Bonnie," She's my best friend, I tell her everything and this whole hang thing might freak her out"
13750,Jeremy," All right, all right, so we'll, um... We'll hang out, eat some food, work on some spells. It's not a big deal. But you did... You did like it, right?"
13751,Bonnie, Yeah. I liked it
13752,Elijah, Good evening
13753,Damon," Thank you for coming. Please, come in"
13754,Elijah," Just one moment. Can I just say that if you have anything less than honorable intentions about how this evening is going to proceed, I suggest you reconsider"
13755,Damon," No, nothing, nothing dishonorable. Just getting to know you"
13756,Elijah," Hmm. Well, that's good. Because, you know, although Elena and I have this deal, if you so much as make a move to cross me, I'll k*ll you and I'll k*ll everyone in this house. Are we clear?"
13757,Damon, Crystal
13758,Elijah, Jenna. Wonderful to see you again. How are you? Nice to see you. You look incredible
13759,Jenna, Thank you
13760,Jenna," I hate to break it to you, Damon, but according to Elijah, your family is so not a founder of this town"
13761,Damon," Hmm, do tell"
13762,Elijah," Well, as I mentioned to Jenna earlier, a faction of settlers migrated from Salem after the witch trials in the 1690s. Over the next hundred years they developed this community where they could feel safe from persecution"
13763,Jenna, Hmm. Because they were witches
13764,Andie," Yeah, but there's no tangible proof there were witches in Salem"
13765,Damon, Andie's a journalist. Big on facts
13766,Elijah," Well, the lore says that there was this wave of anti-witch hysteria. It broke out in the neighboring settlement, so these witches were rounded up. They were tied to stakes in a field together and, uh, b*rned. Some say you could hear the screams from miles around us. They were consumed by the fire. Could you pass the..."
13767,Jenna, I wouldn't repeat this to the Historical Society
13768,John, It's starting to sound a little like a ghost story to me
13769,Damon, So why do you want to know the location of these alleged massacres?
13770,Elijah," You know... a healthy historian's curiosity, of course"
13771,Damon, Of course
13772,Elena, Jonathan Gilbert got crazier and crazier. I guess that's what happens when you spend your life obsessed with vampires
13773,Elena, He researched the Originals
13774,Stefan, You're kidding
13775,Elena," Later in life, Look"
13776,Elena, Pages and pages of questions and scribbles. What's that?
13777,Elena," ""The wood from one tree and one tree alone, an ancient white oak would bring death to an Original vampire. When the tree b*rned, all hope was thought lost."" He was trying to figure out how to k*ll an Original"
13778,Elena," ""But the ash from the tree was saved and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded. This alchemic bond provides the necessary poison"""
13779,Stefan, Elena...
13780,Elena," I wonder if this is true. I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?"
13781,Stefan, I know it does... Because John gave it to Damon
13782,Elena, John gave Damon the w*apon that's supposed to k*ll Elijah? This one?
13783,Elena," ""It must be brandished by humans alone, for it will bring death to all demons who wield it"""
13784,Stefan, John's trying to get Damon k*ll
13785,Damon, Does anyone care for some cognac? I have a bottle I've been saving for ages
13786,Alaric, None for me thanks. Nine bottles of wine is my limit
13787,Stefan, Why is your phone off? Call me
13788,Elena," What's going on, Stefan?"
13789,Stefan, Damon is planning on k*ll Elijah. Tonight
13790,Andie, The gentlemen should take their drinks in the study
13791,Elijah, I have to say the food was almost as wonderful as the company
13792,Andie, I like you
13793,Jenna," Here you are, gentleman, make yourself useful. Hmm?"
13794,Alaric," Here, here. Put me to work"
13795,Jenna," Um, I got it"
13796,Alaric," Hey, Jenna, are you... are you ok?"
13797,Jenna," Yeah, fine, Ric"
13798,John, I suspect this is my fault
13799,Alaric, What did you do now?
13800,John, I merely mentioned you haven't been completely honest with her about your dead wife
13801,Alaric, You son of bitch
13802,John," I think I've been very clear with you, Ric. I want my ring back"
13803,Alaric, Hello. Slow down. Slow down. Stefan?
13804,Damon," So, let me guess. In addition to the moonstone, the doppelganger, the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, you need to find this witch burial ground"
13805,Elijah," Because I feel as though we've grown so close, Damon, I'll tell you yes. Do you know where it is?"
13806,Damon, Maybe. Tell me why it's so important
13807,Elijah, We're not that close
13808,Elijah, It's quite a collection you have here
13809,Damon, Hmm
13810,Elijah," It's a funny thing about books. Before they existed, people actually had memories"
13811,Alaric," Gentlemen, we forgot about dessert"
13812,Andie, Elijah
13813,Elijah, Miss Star...
13814,Jenna," Sorry, guys, dessert is taking longer than I thought. I usually just unwrap food"
13815,Andie," So... I know this is a social thing, but I... I would really love to ask you some more questions about the work that you're doing here"
13816,Elijah, I'd love to answer
13817,Andie," Great, that's so great"
13818,Andie," Ric, would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag?"
13819,Damon," Elijah, did John tell you he's Elena's uncle/father?"
13820,Elijah," Yes, I'm well aware of that"
13821,Damon," Of course, she hates him, so there's absolutely no need to keep him on the endangered species list"
13822,Andie," Ric, it's in the front pocket. On the... you know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry"
13823,John," What I'd like to know, Elijah, is how do you intend on k*ll Klaus?"
13824,Elijah," Gentlemen, there's a few things we should probably get clear right now. I allow you to live solely to keep on eye on Elena. I allow Elena to remain in her house living her life with her friends as she does as a courtesy. If you become a liability, I'll take her away from you and you'll never see her again"
13825,Andie, Ok. My first question is when you got here to Mystic...
13826,Alaric," Now, get rid of him before Jenna comes back with dessert"
13827,Damon, All right
13828,Stefan," Elena, we need to talk about this"
13829,Elena," What good is talking if you and Damon are just gonna lie to me? If you don't like my decisions, that's fine. There's nothing I can do about that but if you ever go behind my back again, I'll..."
13830,Stefan," you're gonna what? Hmm? What are you gonna do, Elena?"
13831,Elena, It's my life
13832,Stefan," Yeah, exactly. It's your life and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that you live it"
13833,Elena, Then what? This... this... this trip through the past. You being honest. Was there any truth to that or were you just distracting me?
13834,Stefan, I was telling you about a time when I thought everything was lost. When I had given up because that's exactly what you're doing right now
13835,Elena, That is not what...
13836,Stefan," Yes, it is! Even if you don't want to admit it. You are giving up... and Lexi? she wouldn't let me give up. I'm not gonna let you"
13837,Lexi, All of these men are dead or dying. What does that make you feel?
13838,Stefan, Nothing. I feel nothing
13839,Lexi, Because you shut out the part of you that was human. The part that lets you feel
13840,Stefan, Is that not the point?
13841,Lexi," Well, there is a better way. You simply have to want it"
13842,Stefan, Is it better?
13843,Lexi, Not at first. You can't choose what you feel. You have to let it all back in. The pain and the look in their eyes when you took their life. The cries of their loved ones
13844,Stefan, Why would I want to do that? Hmm?
13845,Lexi," Because once you can hurt, you can love. Love, Stefan. That's the point. Everything is intensified when you're a vampire. When we hurt, we really hurt. But when we love..."
13846,Stefan," Lexi showed me that there was another way. And from that day forward, I started fighting for it. For my own survival. That's all I want you to do. I just want you to fight for it"
13847,Alaric," Now, you said there wasn't going to be any violence"
13848,Damon, Says the guy that did all the k*ll
13849,Alaric," Hey, I took the sh*t because I saw an opening, not because I planned to do this with Jenna in the house. Now, you can't lie to me like that. Hey, I am your friend, damn it. And you don't have any friends. So, no more lying"
13850,Stefan, Elijah's dead. Alaric did it
13851,Elena," Originals believed in truth and honor. It was forbidden for a vampire to k*ll another vampire. So, the dagger would take both lives. And as long as the dagger stays in place, the Original, for all intents and purposes, is dead"
13852,Jonas, What happened?
13853,Elijah, I need you to find Elena. Now
13854,Jeremy," Ah... now, that is cool. How does it work?"
13855,Bonnie," It's called channeling. Siphoning power from something... another witch... the Moon, an element"
13856,Jeremy," So, technically, you could channel me"
13857,Bonnie, What?
13858,Jeremy," Well, I'm an element, sort of. I mean, isn't... isn't the human body mostly water?"
13859,Bonnie, You're right. Let's... see what happens
13860,Jeremy, What the hell are you doing here?
13861,Bonnie, Jeremy!
13862,Jonas, What did my son tell you? What did he tell you?
13863,Bonnie, He told me about your daughter. I know Klaus has her and I want to help you get her back. But i want us to work together. Please
13864,Jonas, This is for your own good
13865,Bonnie, No! No. No!
13866,Jonas," If any harm comes to my son because of what you did, you will answer to me"
13867,Jeremy, You ok? It's ok. What happened?
13868,Bonnie, He took my powers
13869,Stefan, He's here
13870,Elena, You have to go. I need to talk to him alone
13871,Stefan, Elena...
13872,Elena," Stefan, I'm ok. He can't come in the house"
13873,Elijah," You know, I might not be able to enter this house... But I'm a very patient man. I'll wait you out"
13874,Elena, They shouldn't have done what they did
13875,Elijah, The deal is off
13876,Elena, I'm renegotiating
13877,Elijah, You have nothing left to negotiate with
13878,Elena, I'd like to see you lure Klaus into Mystic Falls after the doppelganger bleeds to death
13879,Elijah, Stefan won't let you die
13880,Elena," No, he won't. He'll feed me his bl*od to heal me, and then I'll k*ll myself and become a vampire, just like Katherine did. So unless you want that to happen again, promise me the same as before... promise me... You won't harm anyone that I love. Even if they've harmed you"
13881,Elijah," I'm sorry, Elena. I'm going to have to call your bluff"
13882,Elijah," No! Yes. Yes, you can have your deal. Let me heal you"
13883,Elena, Give me your word!
13884,Elijah, I give you my word!
13885,Damon, Little tip. Don't pull the dagger out
13886,Alaric, Where did John disappear to?
13887,Jenna, Maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to
13888,Alaric," Look, Jenna, I'm, uh... I'm so sorry tonight was..."
13889,Jenna, what happened to Isobel?
13890,Alaric," You know, John should have never brought that up"
13891,Jenna, That's not an answer
13892,Alaric, He's just trying to stir up trouble
13893,Jenna," That's not an answer, either"
13894,Alaric," I can't talk about this, Jenna"
13895,Jenna," I keep thinking that maybe it's me. Maybe I'm reading into things. I should trust you. That's what a relationship is about, right? But then I think that maybe John is right and maybe you're not being honest with me. So... are you being honest?"
13896,Jenna," Right, ok. ...that was an answer"
13897,John," Well, that was awkward. You know, I can clear all this stuff up about Isobel tomorrow, if you want Or not"
13898,Alaric, You want it? Take it. It's yours
13899,Alaric, And after what you did to Damon... You're gonna need it more than me
13900,Damon, Uhh! What do we have here? A little moonstone bar of soap. I'll hold on to this
13901,Elena," So, that's it. I mean, as long as we keep the dagger in there, then he stays dead"
13902,Damon, Pretty much
13903,Elena," Ok, then... Good night. You know, you guys want me to fight, fine, I'll fight. But if we're gonna do this, you can't keep anything from me anymore. From this moment on, we're doing it my way"
13904,Damon, That seems fair
13905,Stefan, Okay
13906,Elena, Okay
13907,Damon, Seems like she's had a change of attitude. How did you get through to her?
13908,Stefan, I told her a little story about when I was making the wrong decisions and somebody showed me there was a better way
13909,Damon, Lexi?
13910,Stefan, Yeah. You remember her?
13911,Lexi, Going somewhere?
13912,Damon, You must be the vampire I hear my brother complaining about
13913,Lexi, That would be me. And you must be the brother who hates him
13914,Damon, We are at irreparable odds
13915,Lexi, You know the hate you're feeling towards Stefan? Towards everyone? You think you have it under control but you don't. It will get the best of you
13916,Damon, Help him. He needs it
13917,Lexi, I'll help him
13918,Damon, Andie? I thought you left
13919,Katherine," Hello, Damon. Hey, do you have a robe?"
13920,Damon, How did you get out?
13921,Katherine," I knew that if I begged you not to k*ll Elijah, that's exactly what you'd do. Little known fact... Originals can compel vampires. But as soon as they die, the compulsion wears off"
13922,Damon, And you knew
13923,Katherine," And I'm still here. I didn't run. I meant what I said to him, Damon. I'm going to help you"
13924,Katherine, So... How about that robe?
13925,Elena," Stefan, we're late for school Stefan: Let's be later Elena: Stefan, it's school. Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?"
13926,Stefan, School?
13927,Stefan, Doesn't ring a bell
13928,Elena," Stefan! Ok, 5 minutes, only 5 minutes"
13929,Elena," Good morning, Damon"
13930,Damon, What are you doing here? I told you to leave
13931,Elena, What is your problem?
13932,Damon, You're wearing her clothes? Like that's going to work
13933,Elena, You think I'm Katherine? Why would you think that? Katherine's in a tomb! Isn't she?
13934,Stefan, What the hell's going on here?
13935,Elena," I don't know, you tell me. Is Katherine in the tomb or not?"
13936,Elena, What are you doing?!
13937,Stefan, How could you do this?!
13938,Elena," Stefan, you're hurting me!"
13939,Stefan," Stop it, Katherine!"
13940,Katherine, Stop what? It's getting really easy being you
13941,Elena, What is she doing here?
13942,Damon," When we k*ll Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb"
13943,Stefan, How's that possible?
13944,Katherine, He's an Original. They have all sorts of special k*ll
13945,Elena, I don't want you here. Get her out of here
13946,Katherine," You need me, Elena. You all do"
13947,Stefan, Like hell
13948,Katherine," We all want the same thing... Klaus dead. Yet here you all are, running around like chickens with their heads cut off"
13949,Elena, I don't need your help and I don't want it
13950,Katherine," And that's incredibly stupid of you. You know where Klaus is? When he's coming, what he looks like?"
13951,Damon," If you know something, say it or get out"
13952,Katherine, Fine. Then I'll just go to the grill and have some lunch... maybe Aunt Jenna's free for a bite
13953,Caroline," Hey, Matt"
13954,Matt, Hey
13955,Caroline, Live band?
13956,Matt," Yeah, business has been a little slow. The grill's trying to stay afloat"
13957,Caroline, Aren't we all?
13958,Matt, Have you heard from Tyler?
13959,Caroline, Not a peep. You?
13960,Matt," No, not since he stopped by the grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone"
13961,Caroline, He stopped by to see you? What did he say?
13962,Matt," Not much, really. I mean... I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know"
13963,Caroline, And that's all he said?
13964,Matt," Yeah. Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline. Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?"
13965,Caroline," Yeah! I... I mean, no, I... it's just not that easy"
13966,Matt, I don't get it! Since when have I been the one that can express himself and you're one with a loss for words?
13967,Caroline," No, you're right, and I'm sorry"
13968,Matt, You know how I feel. So it's your move. Just make a decision or leave me alone
13969,Elena, Why is she still here? She was free
13970,Stefan, She wants what we want... Klaus's death. Maybe she sees us as her only chance
13971,Elena, Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web. I want her gone
13972,Stefan," So do I. But you're right, she's staying. Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?"
13973,Elena, How? All she does is lie
13974,Stefan," Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point. We don't know anything about Klaus. She does"
13975,Elena," Right, but that doesn't mean I want her shacking up with you"
13976,Stefan, Maybe we should stay at your place tonight
13977,Elena," Hmm, I can't. I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over. Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and Caroline's having Matt drama again. It's kind of a girls' night. Maybe Katherine can join us"
13978,Katherine," Mmm, burning flesh. If you're trying to get the dagger back, you're wasting your time. He's indestructible"
13979,Damon, No kidding. How do you know so much about Original vampires?
13980,Katherine, Spend 500 years running from one
13981,Damon," So when I told you my plan to k*ll Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him?"
13982,Katherine," Oh, there's so many rules. It's all very confusing"
13983,Damon, Did you know I would die?
13984,Katherine, Did Elijah tell you his plan? Did he have a dagger to k*ll Klaus with?
13985,Damon, Why are you still here?
13986,Katherine, Because you haven't forcibly removed me
13987,Katherine, You wouldn't
13988,Damon," Oh, I would"
13989,Katherine," Damon, be smart. I want Klaus dead just as much as you do. More. If I wasn't be honest about helping, I'd be long gone by now, ok? You can hate me. But we want the same thing. And you know... I always get what I want"
13990,Katherine, Didn't matter who paid the price. Of course I knew that you'd die
13991,Bonnie, She's out of the tomb?
13992,Stefan," Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right? Just be extra careful. She's getting a little too good at impersonating Elena"
13993,Jeremy," With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back"
13994,Stefan," Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side. I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture"
13995,Bonnie, It's impossible. They hate us
13996,Stefan, It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead. You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
13997,Bonnie, I'll try
13998,Stefan, Thanks. Keep me posted
13999,Bonnie, Ok. I gotta get to class
14000,Jeremy," All right, I'll see ya"
14001,Jeremy, Come on. Elena's nowhere in sight
14002,Bonnie, I'll tell her soon. I promise
14003,Jeremy, Alright
14004,Alaric," It was bad. You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel and now Jenna knows I'm lying about something"
14005,Elena, John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful
14006,Alaric," Yeah, well, easier said than done. I gave him back his ring so... Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel. You know, was she m*rder? Why haven't they found the body? I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark?"
14007,Elena, You think we should tell her the truth?
14008,Alaric," I'm saying I can't be with her and not tell her. It's not fair to her, and it's not the kind of relationship I want. Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know"
14009,Elena," I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus. You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know? How does someone hear that?"
14010,Alaric," Look, I'm sorry to put this on you. But I feel it's your decision to make. And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it. I want to be honest with her. But until then, Jenna and I are done"
14011,Stefan, Thank you for coming
14012,Jonas, I didn't want to but my son made a case to hear you out
14013,Luka, Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah
14014,Stefan, Elijah's dead. I'm sorry
14015,Stefan, Hear me out. We can help you
14016,Bonnie," We know that Klaus has your daughter. I'm sorry about the way I had to get that information, but it's good that we know. We can all work together to get her back"
14017,Luka, How?
14018,Stefan, I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to k*ll Klaus. I'll just help you carry it out. You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do
14019,Katherine, What you up to?
14020,Damon, None of your business
14021,Katherine, We're pouting now? Are those the Gilbert journals?
14022,Katherine, How am I supposed to help you if you won't tell me what you're up to?
14023,Damon, Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
14024,Katherine, No
14025,Damon, Then you can't help
14026,Katherine," If it's any consolation, I'm glad that you're not dead"
14027,Katherine," Emily Bennett told me about the m*ssacre. It was a big deal in witch folklore. When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy marking the place of their death with power"
14028,Damon, Elijah wanted to know the site of the m*ssacre
14029,Katherine, What was he going to do when he found it?
14030,Damon, I don't know. What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
14031,Stefan, Wasn't she gone or dead yet?
14032,Katherine," For the last time, I'm here to help. Can we skip the secrets, hmm?"
14033,Stefan, Elijah had no w*apon to k*ll Klaus but he believed that if a witch could channel enough power... They wouldn't need one
14034,Damon, Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
14035,Stefan, We just need to find it
14036,Luka, But what if they can find the burial ground?
14037,Jonas," They won't. We tried, Luka, for weeks"
14038,Luka," We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta"
14039,Jonas," We will save her but Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother. Those people, they're our enemies. They need to be dealt with"
14040,Luka, You're going to k*ll them?
14041,Jonas, No. I'm going to let Elijah do it
14042,Caroline, Chinese food or pizza?
14043,Elena, Like you have to ask
14044,Caroline, I will get it
14045,Bonnie, I'll do it
14046,Elena, Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
14047,Bonnie, I don't know what to believe. I think he's at a loss. He's not sure who to trust
14048,Elena, Join the club
14049,Caroline," Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation? What about ""The Notebook""?"
14050,Elena," Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?"
14051,Caroline, That is so not the point
14052,Elena," Well, yeah, I mean..."
14053,Elena, Hey
14054,Jenna, What's going on?
14055,Elena, Girls' night
14056,Jenna, Oh
14057,Elena, How are you doing?
14058,Jenna, You heard about my fight with Ric
14059,Elena, He feels terrible
14060,Jenna, Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
14061,Elena," No. No, this is about us girls hanging out and you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or..."
14062,Caroline, Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships
14063,Jenna," You, too?"
14064,Caroline, You have no idea
14065,Jenna," Ok, then"
14066,Jenna, It's this whole Isobel thing. He's hiding something from me
14067,Caroline," To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you. Maybe he is just trying to protect you"
14068,Jenna," Well, that's not his call to make. I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does"
14069,Caroline, Sometimes it's harder than that
14070,Jenna," Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't"
14071,Caroline, You know what we need? Dancing. There is a band at the grill
14072,Bonnie, I'm in
14073,Jenna, In
14074,Elena, In
14075,Jonas," Are you sure about this? I mean, I would go if I could"
14076,Luka, No. I'm not strong enough to send you. I can do this
14077,Jonas, I'll stay anchored. Use all my energy. If you feel weak...
14078,Luka, Dad. I want this just as much as you
14079,Jonas, Concentrate on Elijah. Picture him in your mind
14080,Luka, I got it
14081,Luka, I'm in the Salvatore house. Elijah's body must be there
14082,Jonas, What do you see?
14083,Luka, Elena and Damon. They're reading
14084,Jonas," Good. If Elijah's there, you'll sense him. Stay focused"
14085,Damon, Can I help you?
14086,Katherine, I'm bored
14087,Katherine," ""Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today. They kidnapped her from her home and took her to the same location her ancestors were b*rned a hundred years ago."" So Emily died on the site of the m*ssacre, too. Does it say where?"
14088,Damon," Nope. You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?"
14089,Katherine, Mm-hmm
14090,Damon, I don't buy it
14091,Katherine," I have no reason to lie to you, Damon"
14092,Damon, Lie
14093,Katherine, I'm hungry
14094,Damon, You're the unwanted houseguest. Go feed yourself
14095,Stefan," Well, nothing in any of those. Find anything?"
14096,Damon, Nope
14097,Stefan, That's too bad
14098,Damon," Yeah, bummer"
14099,Luka, Elena's fighting me 
14100,Jonas, What's wrong?
14101,Luka, She's stronger than me
14102,Jonas, That's because it's not Elena. It's Katherine Pierce. Luka... k*ll her
14103,Luka, What?
14104,Jonas, She's a vampire. Find a stake and drive it through her heart
14105,Katherine, Damon!
14106,Damon, Katherine
14107,Damon, What happened?
14108,Jonas, Luka! Luka!
14109,Stefan, What are you doing?!
14110,Damon, Shutting down a crazy ass psychic witch attack! Get over there and do something about it. Now!
14111,Jonas," Oh, my God! Luka! Luka! I'm sorry. Please. Just wake up, son. Open your eyes"
14112,Jenna, I need a drink
14113,Caroline," Hey, Matt"
14114,Bonnie, Things just got real awkward
14115,Alaric, Jenna
14116,Jenna," Not tonight, Ric. Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila"
14117,Alaric," Yeah. Well, señor tequila's not going to be treating you very well"
14118,Jenna," Well, the two of you have a lot in common"
14119,Alaric," Look, Jenna, I hate that you're this upset with me"
14120,Jenna," Yeah, well, it's your fault. Because whatever it is you're keeping from me, Whatever you think I can't handle... You're wrong. 'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive and now I'm a parent, so I think I can handle anything, Ric"
14121,Alaric, Jenna...
14122,Bonnie, He said the ball's in your court
14123,Caroline," Yeah, but I can't do anything about it"
14124,Bonnie, Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him
14125,Caroline," Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets"
14126,Elena," Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna and maybe that's our mistake. We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway"
14127,Elena, What are you doing?
14128,Caroline," Hey, everybody. Let's hear it for the band! Weren't they awesome? So there's this guy. And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him. Like it's so easy. Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about. Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself. I can sing. Yeah! Yeah. You know what, I'm going to sing"
14129,Singer," Come on, off the stage"
14130,Caroline," You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up"
14131,Jonas, You k*ll him
14132,Jonas, He's dead and I have no one. And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like
14133,Katherine, What the hell?!
14134,Damon, That's for not telling me the dagger would k*ll me. Next time... It goes in your heart
14135,Katherine, Is that how you treat someone who...
14136,Katherine, is trying to help you?
14137,Damon, You wanna help? Start talking
14138,Katherine," I'd love to, but you're not going to like it"
14139,Damon, Try me
14140,Katherine, Fine. John Gilbert and Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life
14141,Damon, That's old news
14142,Katherine," Not the part where he offered me a deal. He knew that k*ll Elijah would get me out of the tomb, so he gave me a choice. Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he k*ll Stefan"
14143,Damon, But he still tried to have me k*ll
14144,Katherine, Right. That was part of the deal. I could only save one of you
14145,Damon, So you chose Stefan. Of course you did
14146,Katherine," You wanted the truth, Damon. Would you rather I lie?"
14147,Elena," Ahh! Oh, sorry"
14148,Matt," You know, I really have to get back to work"
14149,Caroline, Definitely
14150,Elena, I... I wouldn't. Caroline and Matt are...
14151,Bonnie, In the bathroom?!
14152,Elena," If they're happy, I'm happy."
14153,Bonnie," Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?"
14154,Elena, You're into my brother?
14155,Bonnie," I know it's weird, um, but he's been so good and strong. It makes me happy and I really can't tell what you're thinking... Right now"
14156,Elena," I'm thinking that... My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and... He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you"
14157,Bonnie, Really?
14158,Elena, Really
14159,Elena," Hey, Stefan, I'm at the grill. I can't hear you. Hold... yeah"
14160,Katherine, Where are you going?
14161,Damon, Luka Martin's dead. His father's going after Elena
14162,Katherine, I'm coming with you
14163,Damon," No, you're not"
14164,Katherine, Wait
14165,Damon, I don't need your help. I don't want it
14166,Katherine," I know what we can do, Damon. You have to let me do it"
14167,Bonnie, Dr. Martin. You ok?
14168,Jonas, Where is she?
14169,Bonnie, I don't understand
14170,Jonas, My son is dead
14171,Bonnie," Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way"
14172,Jonas, They k*ll Elijah and they k*ll Luka and my only sh*t at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena
14173,Bonnie," No. No, Dr. Martin"
14174,Jonas, Where is she?
14175,Bonnie, I don't know. I haven't seen her
14176,Matt, What the hell?
14177,Caroline, Mmm!
14178,Matt, The power's out
14179,Caroline, Even better
14180,Matt," I wish, but I should probably..."
14181,Caroline, Hey
14182,Elena, We have a problem
14183,Caroline, What's going on?
14184,Stefan, Jonas is here and he's after Elena
14185,Caroline," Oh, my God!"
14186,Stefan," We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here"
14187,Caroline," Well, what can I do?"
14188,Alaric, It's time to get out of here
14189,Jenna, I have to find Elena
14190,Alaric," She's with Stefan, she's ok"
14191,Jonas, No one's getting out of here until I have her
14192,Bonnie, Don't do this. Please don't do this
14193,Matt," Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!"
14194,Matt," Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!"
14195,Elena," Dr. Martin! I'm so sorry about Luka. I never wanted that to happen, but... at least let us help you get your daughter back"
14196,Jonas, Only Elijah can do that
14197,Elena, You don't need Elijah
14198,Matt, Caroline!
14199,Matt, Get away from her!
14200,Caroline," Matt, no!"
14201,Caroline," Matt! Matt! Oh! Oh, my God!"
14202,Caroline, Just breath Caroline... just breath
14203,Caroline," You have to drink. Please, please"
14204,Bonnie, Luka... I can't believe he's dead. After what we did to him
14205,Jeremy," No, after what he did to you. Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this but I don't"
14206,Bonnie, I couldn't do anything to help. I was useless. I hated it
14207,Bonnie, Thank God
14208,Elena, It's not over yet
14209,Jeremy, What's going on?
14210,Elena, He'll explain
14211,Stefan, When did you guys get home?
14212,Bonnie, A few minutes ago
14213,Stefan, Did you check the house?
14214,Jeremy, And why would we check the house?
14215,Katherine, You're welcome
14216,Bonnie, You didn't have to k*ll him!
14217,Katherine," Yes, we did"
14218,Elena, How did you guys convince her to do this?
14219,Damon, We didn't. It was actually her idea
14220,Elena, Wow. That's... Not good
14221,Damon," No. No, that's not good at all"
14222,Stefan, Everything's taken care of
14223,Katherine, I'm guessing you're going to want this back. But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry clean
14224,Elena, You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home
14225,Katherine, Is that all you have to say to me?
14226,Elena, This doesn't change the way I feel about you
14227,Katherine," I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open and frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kinda need you to be alive. So I'm not a threat to you, Elena. If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that"
14228,Jenna, Thanks for getting me home. That was kind of crazy
14229,Alaric," Jenna, are you going to be ok? Look, Isobel is dead and there things about her death that I can't tell you. That aren't for me to tell. You can be upset and hate me. I get it but just know that I love you. At least I can tell you that much"
14230,Jenna," Good night, Ric"
14231,Alaric, Good night
14232,Elena, Hey. You made it home
14233,Jenna, Tonight was very weird
14234,Elena, Tell me about it
14235,Jeremy, I'm worried about you
14236,Bonnie, Don't be
14237,Jeremy," No, I'm serious, Bonnie. The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and... I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and..."
14238,Jeremy, Not that denial's the worst thing
14239,Jeremy, Did you...
14240,Bonnie, When he grabbed me... He gave me my powers back and something else. Jonas wants me to k*ll Klaus
14241,Jeremy, And did he include a how?
14242,Bonnie, Yeah. He did
14243,Damon, You know what I can't figure out?
14244,Katherine, What's that?
14245,Damon," How the town knew Emily Bennett was a witch. I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew. I know he didn't turn her in."
14246,Damon," Mmm, I should have figured as much"
14247,Katherine," Oh, she was a loose end. I like mine tied up. You know what I can't figure out?"
14248,Damon, Do I care?
14249,Katherine, Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch m*ssacre
14250,Damon, Because I have no clue
14251,Katherine," You knew that Emily Bennett was the key to getting me out of that tomb and something tells me that you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe, yet you have no idea where she was k*ll. Who's the liar now? You hurt me today"
14252,Damon, Tit for tat
14253,Katherine, You were mean and very rough and monstrous
14254,Damon, You deserved it
14255,Katherine," I like this, Damon"
14256,Damon," Katherine. Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house"
14257,Damon, Go find one
14258,Caroline, Hi
14259,Matt, What the hell? I had your face... And all the bl*od. I... I drank your bl*od
14260,Caroline, You were dying. My bl*od healed you
14261,Matt," What do you mean, it healed me? How can your bl*od heal me?"
14262,Caroline," Because that's what vampire bl*od does for humans, and that's what I am. I'm a vampire, Matt."
14263,Matt, No
14264,Caroline," But it's all going to be ok, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine"
14265,Matt, We'll be fine?!
14266,Caroline," Yes, because we're together and we love each other"
14267,Matt," Vampires. Oh, my God. Vickie, oh, my God, at the hospital, I thought that she was tripping out"
14268,Caroline, What?
14269,Matt," Vickie, she knew about the vampires, and I... What... what did you do?"
14270,Caroline, Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
14271,Matt, I need to get out of here
14272,Caroline," No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave"
14273,Matt, What did you do to my sister?
14274,Caroline," Nothing! Nothing! I swear, I swear, nothing, nothing!"
14275,Matt, What did you do?!
14276,Caroline," Nothing, Matt! You have to calm down! Matt!"
14277,Jenna, Are John and Jeremy asleep?
14278,Elena, I think so
14279,Jenna," If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free"
14280,Jenna, Who's that?
14281,Isobel, Hi. You must be Jenna
14282,Isobel, I'm... Elena's mother
14283,Elena, Isobel
14284,Isobel," Hello, Elena. It's nice to see you again"
14285,Jenna, Again?
14286,Isobel, So you're the woman who's dating my husband. I need to speak to Elena. May I come in?
14287,Elena, N-n-no. Don't... don't invite her in
14288,Isobel," I need to talk to you, Elena"
14289,Elena, No!
14290,Jenna, You knew she was still alive? Rick? John? Did they know?
14291,Elena," I can explain everything, Jenna"
14292,Jenna, No
14293,Elena," No. Jenna, please"
14294,Elena," Jenna, please. No, wait. Jenna, please wait"
14295,Jenna," Jenna, you have to talk to me. I... I need to explain what's going on. Jenna, please"
14296,Stefan, Isobel just showed up at their front doorstep
14297,Damon, What's she doing here?
14298,Stefan, I don't know. That's what I'm gonna go find out
14299,Katherine, I don't think that you should tell her that I'm here
14300,Stefan, What? Why?
14301,Katherine, It's better if she and John not know that I stayed in town after I got out of the tomb
14302,Damon, You're the one in cahoots with them. You made a deal with John that almost got me k*ll
14303,Katherine, I did what I had to to get out of the tomb. Now I'm reconsidering my alliance
14304,Stefan, What do you know?
14305,Katherine," I know that I want Klaus dead, which puts me squarely on team you. Besides, if you two ever need me to swap places with Elena again, the less people know that I'm here, the better. Think about it, Stefan. Come on. Be smart"
14306,Stefan," Tell you what. You two, uh... Call Alaric and let him know that his wife's just showed up on his girlfriend's doorstep"
14307,Alaric, Hey. Is she up yet?
14308,Elena, She won't come out of her room 
14309,Alaric, What'd you tell her?
14310,Elena, Nothing. She won't talk to me
14311,Alaric," We're gonna have to fix this, Elena"
14312,Elena, Hey
14313,Alaric, Jenna
14314,Jenna," I don't want you here, Rick. You need to go"
14315,Alaric," Ok, listen. I can't begin to imagine what you must be feeling right now"
14316,Jenna, Rage and betrayal would pretty much cover it
14317,Elena, Where are you going?
14318,Jenna," I'm going to stay on campus. I have a thesis to write, and I don't want to be in this house"
14319,Alaric," Jenna, please just stop. Let us explain to you exactly what is going on"
14320,Jenna," Elena, I need you to go to the Lockwood's' today and accept the historical society's check for your mom's foundation"
14321,Elena," Ok, but, Jenna, please just..."
14322,Jenna, I don't have it in me to hear any more lies from you
14323,Elena," Jenna, just…"
14324,John," Let her go. It's better that she's not here, what with everything that's going on but maybe had you been a little more honest with her from the beginning, this..."
14325,Alaric," sorry, Elena"
14326,Elena," You know this is your fault, right?"
14327,John, Right
14328,Caroline, I can't find him anywhere. He's not at home. He's not answering his phone 
14329,Stefan, How could you let him go?
14330,Caroline, My mom walked in. He took off. I didn't know what to do
14331,Stefan, Did your mom hear anything?
14332,Caroline," No. She just thinks we're fighting but he knows about me, and he's freaking out about Vicki"
14333,Stefan, All right. Listen. You have to find him. You have to calm him down. Compel him if you have to. Is he still on the vervain?
14334,Caroline," I slip it into his soda when he's at work, but I didn't get to last night, so it's out of his system. He has a catering shift at the Lockwood's' today. I'm gonna try there"
14335,Elena," Ah, this is bad. Between Isobel and Jenna and now Matt, this is disaster bad"
14336,Stefan, Yeah
14337,John," Elena, can you come downstairs, please? I need to talk to you"
14338,Elena, Heh. I have nothing to say to you
14339,John," Please. It's important. You, too, Stefan"
14340,Isobel, I asked John for a do-over
14341,Elena, You invited her in?
14342,John," She has information about Klaus. Please, just listen to her, ok?"
14343,Stefan, All right. What do you know?
14344,Isobel," Since I was last here, I've been doing everything possible to find Klaus. We knew our best chance was to find him before he could find you"
14345,Stefan, Best chance at what?
14346,John, Keeping Elena alive
14347,Elena," You don't get to talk, ok, not after everything you've done"
14348,Stefan, Were you able to find Klaus?
14349,Isobel, No. Nobody knows where he is but there are these rumors that are flying around. That a doppelganger exists
14350,John, Which means any vampire that wants to get in favor with Klaus will be lining up to capture you
14351,Elena, I'm not buying any of this
14352,Elena," The last time that you were here, you made it clear that you didn't give a damn about me. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to believe that you want to help?"
14353,John," Klaus has been obsessed with finding Katherine for centuries. All it would take was any one of those 1864 tomb vampires to spread the word around that Katherine was still alive and it would bring him straight here to Mystic Falls, where you were bound to be discovered, so we k*ll them"
14354,Elena, And almost k*ll Stefan and Damon in the process
14355,Isobel," I have a safe house that I can take you to. The deed is in your name. No vampires can get in without your permission, not even me. Let me help you"
14356,Elena, You wanna help? Then get the hell out of my house
14357,Damon, Yep. Everybody's dead
14358,Bonnie, We should pack up the grimoires. They spent years collecting them. I wanna make sure they're safe
14359,Damon," You know, we could just get another match and cremate 'em"
14360,Bonnie, Don't be disrespectful. Not to him
14361,Damon, Fine. I'll bury him
14362,Jeremy, What exactly are we looking for?
14363,Bonnie," According to Luka's dad, one of these contains a spell that'll let me harness the energy that's left behind when a witch dies violently"
14364,Damon, I didn't know you and father witch were so close
14365,Bonnie," We weren't but when he gave me my powers back, he gave me a message. If I can find the spot in town, where the old Salem witches were b*rned, I can harness their energy to use when I need it"
14366,Damon, Great. We'll have to put that on our list of things to do today. Harness ancient dead-witch power
14367,Bonnie, You know where the witches were b*rned? Did I forget to mention that?
14368,Jeremy, Are we gonna have to read through every one of these books till we find the right spell?
14369,Bonnie, Not exactly
14370,Bonnie, It's this one
14371,Damon, Great. Grab the rest. Let's go
14372,Isobel," Merci, Mon Cherie"
14373,Katherine, Nice house
14374,Isobel, Nicest foreclosure in town
14375,Isobel, Come here
14376,Isobel," It's good to see you, Katherine"
14377,Katherine, I hear you've been busy
14378,Isobel," Yes, I have. I've been busy making a deal with Klaus to save your life"
14379,Isobel, Here. A vintner I knew in Avignon
14380,Katherine, He's tasty
14381,Katherine, So what was with the surprise visit to the Gilbert house?
14382,Isobel, John told me Rick was dating auntie vanilla. I got jealous
14383,Katherine, You have obviously got John wrapped around your finger if he invited you in the house
14384,Isobel," He thinks I'm helping him protect Elena, so he's been very useful in keeping me informed on everything that's been going on"
14385,Katherine, So tell me what you know
14386,Isobel," You were right. I couldn't get anywhere near Klaus, but I found my way to someone in his trusted circle. One of his witches"
14387,Katherine, Klaus and his witches
14388,Isobel, He said that Klaus is willing to grant you your freedom if we deliver the moonstone and the doppelganger
14389,Katherine, I can get the moonstone
14390,Isobel," You know Katherine, you'd be betraying your Salvatore boys again"
14391,Katherine," I was more than willing to play it their way if I had to, but they're floundering. Their witch has lost her powers, and they've used their only w*apon to k*ll Elijah. If I stick with them, I'm dead. You showing up change everything"
14392,Elena, Do you really think that Isobel's telling the truth that word's gotten out about the doppelganger?
14393,Stefan," Look, I don't trust a word that she says, but I think we'd be stupid to ignore the warning"
14394,Damon," You know, you should just stay here. It's better for us to keep an eye on you"
14395,Stefan," What, in the house that any vampire can enter? No. Her house is safer"
14396,Damon," Well, then we'll stay there"
14397,Elena, So is that the plan? Neither of you will let me out of your sight again?
14398,Damon, Let me know when you come up with a better one
14399,Elena, Fine. Then one of you 2 bodyguards is gonna have to come with me to the Lockwood luncheon
14400,Stefan, That'd be me
14401,Damon, Not me. I have witch stuff to attend to with Bonnie
14402,Elena, Does that mean that you're taking her to the…
14403,Damon, Shh
14404,Katherine," Don't get quiet on my account. If you have a plan to combat the impending vampire doom, please do tell"
14405,Katherine," Seriously, what is the plan to get us out of this mess, hmm? I delivered you a moonstone, a werewolf, and the dagger to lure and k*ll Klaus, a werewolf, and right now all you have is a moonstone. Or so you tell me"
14406,Damon," No, we have it. It's in a very safe place"
14407,Katherine, I've been honest with you. Time to return the favor
14408,Damon, Let me be honest with you. Don't mistake the fact that we haven't set you on fire in your sleep for trust
14409,Katherine, Fine. Be that way
14410,Sheriff Forbes," The marshal hasn't been able to figure out what caused the fire at the scene, but he did find bl*od... no body, just bl*od"
14411,Carol, You think vampires were involved?
14412,Sheriff Forbes, I'm starting to assume the answer to that is always a yes
14413,Caroline," Mrs. Lockwood, uh, have you seen Matt? I thought he was working a catering shift at today's brunch"
14414,Carol," No, I haven't, honey. Sorry. But if you see him, could you ask if he's heard from Tyler?"
14415,Caroline," Yeah, of course. Um, still no word from him?"
14416,Carol," No. The note he left said he needed time to figure some things out, but I wish I knew where he was"
14417,Caroline," Um, excuse me"
14418,Stefan, Hey. Any luck finding Matt?
14419,Caroline, None. What if he tells somebody? What if he tells everybody?
14420,Stefan," No, we just gotta find him and make sure that doesn't happen"
14421,Stefan, Do you have any idea where he would be?
14422,Elena," I wish I did, but he wasn't really one to run"
14423,Caroline," You know, this wasn't how it was supposed to happen. You know, I was supposed to tell him at the right moment in the right way, and he was supposed to be ok with it because he loves me"
14424,Elena, We'll help you find him. I just have to accept this thing for Jenna
14425,Caroline," All right. Well, call me when you're done, and I'll be out looking for him"
14426,Stefan, Maybe he'll come around. You did
14427,Jeremy," Is this the spot Emily Bennett was k*ll, too?"
14428,Damon, Founders thought it was poetic burning her where the other witches b*rned
14429,Bonnie, How do you know where the witches were b*rned?
14430,Damon, 'Cause I tried to save her. Emily was just my key to getting Katherine back before I knew what a nasty little bitch Katherine was
14431,Damon," Whatever witchy prank you're playing, don't. It's not funny"
14432,Bonnie, I'm not doing anything
14433,Damon, I can't move
14434,Damon," Oh, my ring's not working. Do something"
14435,Bonnie, I don't think the witches like you being here
14436,Jeremy, I guess this is the right place
14437,Damon, I'm gonna go wait outside
14438,Isobel," Hi, Rick"
14439,Alaric, Isobel. What do you want?
14440,Isobel, Just cleaning up some loose ends
14441,Alaric," Yeah, we don't have any loose ends"
14442,Isobel, You may not. I do. I need to apologize to you
14443,Alaric, It's a little late for that
14444,Isobel," No, not for what I've done in the past. We're beyond that. Although I am sorry for outing you to your girlfriend. That was petty of me"
14445,Alaric," Look, whatever jacked-up vampire amends that you're trying to make with me right now, I'm not interested"
14446,Isobel," Of course not, because I compelled you to let me go. I realize that I don't wanna do what I have to do without you knowing how much I loved you and I did. I loved you so much. He's all yours"
14447,Damon, Wanna hurry it up in there?
14448,Damon," Screw you, too, Emily. You know, you're on your own in there"
14449,Bonnie, Can you hand me the grimoire?
14450,Jeremy," Look, are you sure about this?"
14451,Bonnie, Are you worried about me?
14452,Jeremy," Yeah, of course I am"
14453,Bonnie, I'm sure
14454,Jeremy, What is that?
14455,Bonnie," Spirits of the witches who died here, I can feel them"
14456,Jeremy, All right. What are they saying?
14457,Bonnie, I can't-can't tell
14458,Jeremy, Where are you going?
14459,Bonnie, Here. This is it. Help me set the candles
14460,Jeremy, What the hell are they saying?
14461,Jeremy, What is it?
14462,Bonnie, Nothing
14463,Bonnie, They're ready
14464,Carol, And here to accept the donation to the Miranda Sommers Gilbert scholarship fund is Elena Gilbert
14465,John, What are you doing here?
14466,Isobel, I'm creating a distraction
14467,Elena, The historical society was my mom's baby. She considered all of you family and would be honored and touched by this gift
14468,Katherine, Nice dress. Mind if I borrow it?
14469,Carol," Please, let the sheriff do her job"
14470,Stefan," Uh, he's-he's bleeding. Is he ok?"
14471,Sheriff Forbes," Yeah, I got it. I got it"
14472,Sheriff Forbes, You know what? Let's all back off. He just needs some air. Everything's fine
14473,Stefan, You ok?
14474,Katherine, I'm calling Damon
14475,Stefan, Let's get out of here. Come on
14476,Katherine," It's Isobel, Damon. It's gotta be."
14477,Stefan, Tell him he needs to get over here and deal with John's body
14478,Katherine, You've got some serious explaining to do to the council about John being not so dead
14479,Stefan, Where the hell is she? Huh?
14480,Katherine," I'm sorry, Stef, but I can't have you following me"
14481,Jeremy, Bonnie? You're scaring me
14482,Jeremy, Bonnie!
14483,Jeremy, Bonnie! You ok?
14484,Bonnie, I did it
14485,Jeremy, It's okay
14486,Carol, I'm sorry for the scare. It was just a bad fall. Paramedics are on their way
14487,Damon, Hey. How is he?
14488,Sheriff Forbes, He's dead
14489,Damon, He'll be fine in a couple hours
14490,Carol," What are you talking about? Damon, he's dead"
14491,Damon," Well... Here's the thing. John's ring, it's an old Gilbert family heirloom that protects its owner from death by a supernatural entity"
14492,Carol, But he's not breathing. He has no pulse
14493,Damon," He will be. Trust me. We're gonna need a cover story... epileptic fit, alcohol binge, banana peel, whatever works. But right now I just have to get him out of here"
14494,Sheriff Forbes, Yeah. It's a false alarm at the Lockwood's'. Ok. Good. Thanks
14495,Matt, Sheriff Forbes
14496,Sheriff Forbes," Matt, what's wrong?"
14497,Matt, I wanna see Vicki's file
14498,Sheriff Forbes, What?
14499,Matt, I want to see her file. I want to see how you covered up that she was k*ll by a vampire
14500,Sheriff Forbes," Matt, you need to calm down. You're upset. You don't know…"
14501,Matt, Don't lie to me
14502,Sheriff Forbes," Matt, you need to calm down now"
14503,Damon, Stefan? How'd I b*at you and Elena home? What?
14504,Isobel, Are we good to go?
14505,Katherine," I'm at your house, but we have to hurry. Damon knows your lodging tricks. It will take him all of 20 minutes to find out where you're staying"
14506,Isobel, We'll be long gone before that
14507,Katherine, Good. How far are you?
14508,Isobel," I'm sorry, Katherine"
14509,Isobel, I had to do what I was told. He wanted the moonstone and he wanted you
14510,Katherine, He? He who?
14511,Caroline," Hey, Matt, if you're listening to this that means you've listened to the last 25 messages I've left you, which all say the same thing, so..."
14512,Caroline, You're here
14513,Matt, Your mom brought me here
14514,Caroline, My mom?
14515,Matt, I accused her of covering up Vicki's death and she threatened to arrest me
14516,Caroline, Did you tell her anything else?
14517,Matt," Nothing about you. I got the feeling she wasn't gonna believe anything I said, so I shut up. Then she brought me here to cool down, and then she got called away"
14518,Caroline, Matt...
14519,Caroline, Why'd you stick around if you're still scared of me?
14520,Matt," Because I need to know more about Vicki, about you"
14521,Caroline, I'll tell you anything you wanna know
14522,Jeremy," All right, well, there has to be something in the grimoire to help us translate that chant"
14523,Bonnie, It was just a warning
14524,Jeremy, Heh. What kind of warning?
14525,Bonnie, It's not important
14526,Jeremy," Uh, look, it is important to me, ok?"
14527,Bonnie, It's a lot of power to have access to. They're just telling me to be careful with it
14528,Jeremy," Well, exactly how much power can you draw from a hundred dead witches?"
14529,Bonnie, The answer to your question is a lot
14530,Stefan, Think this is the house?
14531,Damon, Better be. It's the nicest foreclosure in town
14532,Stefan, Swear to God if she's not here...
14533,Damon, don't be such a pessimist
14534,Stefan, I got upstairs
14535,Damon, This is Isobel's stuff. It's definitely the right place
14536,Stefan, Where are they?
14537,Damon," I don't know, Stefan"
14538,Isobel, Just because you can't be compelled doesn't mean I can't force you to come with me
14539,Elena, So is that what happened? You were compelled to betray Katherine?
14540,Isobel," If I was, I couldn't tell you"
14541,Elena," So you lied. You did find Klaus, didn't you? He knows where I am now. Are you taking me to him?"
14542,Elena, What is this?
14543,Isobel," My parents, your grandparents, they put it here when it became clear that the police weren't gonna find my body. They visit every week, and they bring flowers, even though there's no one buried here. The Isobel they knew is dead. So maybe there's a part of me that's buried here, the-the human part, the part that I abandoned when I-when I choose to become a vampire, the part that used to dream about the day that she'd know her daughter"
14544,Elena, What?
14545,Isobel, And instead you got to meet the other part... The part that would betray her own flesh and bl*od
14546,Warlock, I have Katherine and the moonstone. Is the doppelganger safe? 
14547,Isobel, Yes
14548,Warlock, Then let her go
14549,Isobel, Let her go?
14550,Warlock, Klaus has everything he needs for now. Your part is finished. You did what he compelled you to do
14551,Isobel, I'm done?
14552,Warlock, You're done
14553,Elena, Who was that?
14554,Isobel," I'm so sorry, Elena... That I was such a disappointment to you"
14555,Caroline," So after I hurt you in the woods, I made you forget and I promised myself I would stay away from you, but I-I couldn't... 'Cause I love you. I do. I love you, Matt, so much. God, I'm so sorry about what happened to Vicki. And I really wish you'd say something"
14556,Matt, I'm all alone
14557,Caroline," No, you're not"
14558,Matt," My mom doesn't care, my sister's dead, and all of my friends are liars, and you're a..."
14559,Caroline, I'm still me. I'm still me. It's just I'm just a little bit...
14560,Matt, don't. No. This is too much. All of this is just too much. I don't want to know this
14561,Caroline, Tell me what I can do. Tell me what I can do. I... I want to help you
14562,Matt, You can make me forget. You've done it to me before
14563,Caroline, I don't-I don't think that that's...
14564,Matt," please make me forget, Caroline. I don't wanna look at you and see what I'm seeing right now"
14565,Caroline, But maybe after...
14566,Matt," just make me forget, Caroline!"
14567,Caroline," Ok. Ok, Matt"
14568,Stefan, Is that Isobel's?
14569,Elena," I never thought I would feel bad about her being dead, and yet..."
14570,Stefan, She was your mother
14571,Elena, Why did they let me go?
14572,Stefan," Well, anything John told Isobel, we have to assume that Klaus knows, right? So he knows that you're not gonna turn yourself into a vampire. He knows that you have us keeping you safe"
14573,Elena, He knows I'm not gonna run
14574,Damon," Which is why we need to take some precautions, 'cause we got played, all of us"
14575,Elena, What's this?
14576,Stefan," It's the deed to our house. It's in Zach's name. As soon as you sign it, it'll be in your name"
14577,Elena, You're giving me your house?
14578,Stefan," Isobel had the right idea with the safe house. You'll just stay here till it's all over. That way, you can control who gets invited and who doesn't"
14579,Damon, Although I'll be super pissed if you lock me out
14580,John," I swear I had no idea what she was gonna do. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry"
14581,Elena," Damon, let him go. He and I need to talk"
14582,Bonnie, I told you to not worry about that
14583,Jeremy," A warning. That's all you felt like telling me? This is some kind of warning, Bonnie. It says if you use too much of your powers at once, it'll k*ll you. How much would it take to k*ll an Original?"
14584,Bonnie, All of it
14585,Jeremy, No. I'm not gonna let you do that
14586,Bonnie," Jeremy, do you think I was born with these powers so I could float feathers and blow out candles? There's a reason was called to do this"
14587,Jeremy, No one's called to get themselves k*ll. Plus Elena's not gonna let you die for her
14588,Bonnie, That's why you're not gonna tell her
14589,Jeremy, Do you even understand what you're saying right now?
14590,Bonnie," It's not just for Elena, Jeremy. It's for you. It's for everyone. If I am the only one who can put an end to this, then it'll be my decision, no one else's. Mine"
14591,Matt," I did it. I drank that vervain stuff. I went over there, and I got her to tell me everything. Then I asked her to take it away"
14592,Sheriff Forbes," Thank you, Matt. I know this isn't easy, but... I'm glad you told me what happened last night. I want you to tell me everything she said"
14593,Matt, I feel like she died
14594,Sheriff Forbes, She did
14595,John," I always knew that she and Katherine were close but I never realized that Isobel and her were working against me. Two of the world's most uncaring and selfish vampires, and yet they were genuinely friends"
14596,Elena," If that's what you thought of her, why did you ever put your trust in her at all?"
14597,John," Because I was there when she gave birth to you, Elena. I saw how heartbroken she was to give you up. And because she was the first girl I ever loved, and when she said she'd help keep you safe... I believed her. At this point, I will do whatever you want me to do. If you feel safer with me not around, then I'll go"
14598,Elena," You screw up everything, John. Everything you touch just falls apart. But you're the only"
14599,John, Okay
14600,Damon," Hey, Bonnie said the spell worked. She's locked and loaded"
14601,Stefan, At least something went right today. Katherine has no idea that Bonnie got her powers back and Isobel had no idea what you and Jeremy took Bonnie to do today. We're the only ones who know
14602,Damon, That literally makes Bonnie our secret w*apon
14603,Katherine, Alaric?
14604,Alaric," Zdravei, Katerina"
14605,Alaric, I have missed you
14606,Katherine, Klaus
14607,Klaus/Alaric," Oh! Who is this guy, Safari Sam?"
14608,Klaus/Alaric," Ok, bad, or badder?"
14609,Katherine, The dark colors suit you better
14610,Klaus/Alaric," Oh, thank you, honey. Ok, pop quiz. The dagger and white ash are in the Salvatore's possession, correct?"
14611,Katherine, The dagger was used to k*ll Elijah. You'll find him in the basement of the Salvatore house
14612,Klaus/Alaric," Ok, that dagger needs to stay exactly where it is. The last thing I need to do is resurrect Elijah. Ohh, that guy is a k*ll"
14613,Katherine, Don't forget you're on the outs with your girlfriend Jenna
14614,Klaus/Alaric, Right. Elena's aunt. For all the lies about Isobel. What else?
14615,Katherine, That's it
14616,Klaus/Alaric," Oh, so jumpy"
14617,Katherine," Please, just... k*ll me. I've told you everything that I know"
14618,Klaus/Alaric," You see, I believe that you believe that but what would you not know? What could they be keeping from you? Hmm? Anything? Tell me"
14619,Katherine, They were trying to see if Bonnie could find a way to k*ll an Original without a dagger
14620,Klaus/Alaric, Bonnie the best friend? And then you said she didn't have her powers anymore
14621,Katherine," She doesn't or didn't. I don't know. You kidnapped me, remember? I'm kinda out of the loop"
14622,Klaus/Alaric," Well, we'll have to get to the bottom of that"
14623,Katherine," Please, just k*ll me, Klaus, and be done with it"
14624,Klaus/Alaric, And show you kindness? I've searched for you for over 500 years. Your death is going to last at least half that long
14625,Klaus/Alaric, I want you to take this kn*fe... And stab yourself
14626,Klaus/Alaric, Now take it out
14627,Klaus/Alaric," Now while I'm gone, I want you to do that over and over and over again and if you get bored, switch legs"
14628,Katherine, Where are you going?
14629,Klaus/Alaric, I'm gonna go lay eyes on my precious doppelganger
14630,Klaus/Alaric," Oh, don't look so glum, Katerina. The fun is just beginning. Again, please"
14631,Lawyer, Please sign here and here
14632,Elena, Okay
14633,Bonnie, So this place is all yours? They just gave it to you?
14634,Elena," For now. As sole owner, I'm the only one who can invite a certain type of person in here, if you know what I mean"
14635,Bonnie, Your own personal safe house
14636,Elena, That's the idea
14637,Bonnie, Wouldn't want to clean it
14638,Damon, You really think Bonnie can take on Klaus?
14639,Stefan," She said she could channel enough witch's power to k*ll him. Elijah thought that would work and he was an Original, so…"
14640,Damon, We just need to find him
14641,Stefan, Yeah
14642,Damon, Could she do one of those witch tracking spells?
14643,Stefan," Nope. Not without something that belongs to Klaus. Believe me, I already asked"
14644,Damon, Do you think he k*ll her?
14645,Stefan, Katherine? Probably
14646,Damon, It's not like she didn't have it coming
14647,Elena," Thank you, Mr. Henry"
14648,Elena, I'm sorry. I completely forgot
14649,Elena, Stefan. Would you like to come inside my house?
14650,Stefan, I would love to. Thank you
14651,Damon," What are we, 12?"
14652,Elena," One of us is. If I let you in, do you promise to obey the owner of this house?"
14653,Damon, No
14654,Elena," Seriously, Damon. My way. You promised. I call the shots. No lies, no secret agendas. Remember?"
14655,Damon," Yes, Elena. Sure"
14656,Elena," Then please, come in"
14657,Damon, Shut up
14658,Elena, Thanks
14659,Stefan," Wait, where are you going?"
14660,Elena, To school
14661,Stefan, Huh?
14662,Damon," No, no, no. We didn't create a safe house for you to leave it"
14663,Stefan," Yeah, guys, Klaus is out there. We know that"
14664,Elena," Right. But where? No one knows. Look, I really appreciate what you guys are doing. And I'll be able to sleep at night knowing that I'll be safe here, but I'm not going to be a prisoner"
14665,Damon," Your way, Elena"
14666,Bonnie," Don't worry, I'm ready. If he shows his face, I can take him. Know how"
14667,Elena," The way I see it, next to Bonnie is the safest place that I can be. Come on"
14668,Stefan," Wait, um, coming"
14669,Liz, Caroline left early for school
14670,Matt," I know. I came to see you. I don't know what to do. What to say, how to act around her"
14671,Liz, You can't let on that you know
14672,Matt, She wants me to take her to the dance. What am I supposed to do?
14673,Liz, Take her to the dance
14674,Matt," I'll never get away with it. She knows me too well, she'll figure it out"
14675,Liz," Damn it, Matt, just do it. She's my daughter. She's my baby. I just, I need some time"
14676,Matt," I know, but..."
14677,Liz," Look, if what Caroline told you is true, she's not the only one. The Salvatore's are vampires. The Gilbert family is in on it. Tyler Lockwood is God knows what"
14678,Matt, A werewolf
14679,Liz, There's no one in this town I can trust. I just need to take a b*at and figure out what to do
14680,Matt, That'll never fool her
14681,Liz," Yes, you will. As far as she knows, you don't remember anything. Buy me some time. Please, Matt"
14682,Alaric/Klaus," Hello, class. Are we learning today?"
14683,Dana," With the decade dance tonight, we've been covering the sixties all week"
14684,Alaric/Klaus, Right. The sixties
14685,Alaric/Klaus," The, uh, ahem..."
14686,Alaric/Klaus," The sixties. I wish there was something good I could say about the sixties, but... Actually, they kind of sucked. Except for the b*at, of course. They made it bearable. Uh, what else was there? The Cuban m*ssile thing, the... we walked on the moon. There was Watergate"
14687,Elena," Watergate was the seventies, Ric. I-I mean, Mr. Saltzman"
14688,Alaric/Klaus," Right. It all kind of mushes together up here, the sixties, seventies. Thank you, Elena"
14689,Caroline," Hey, Dana. Um, can you take care of these?"
14690,Dana, Sure
14691,Caroline," Ok, thank you"
14692,Caroline, Hey
14693,Caroline, What was that for?
14694,Matt, Just practicing for tonight
14695,Matt, So I... found a suit. If you still want me to be JFK
14696,Caroline, Perfect
14697,Jeremy, Do you think Elena knows what it's going to take for you to do that Klaus spell?
14698,Bonnie," No, and you're not, either"
14699,Jeremy," Well, she's gotta know you can't do it"
14700,Bonnie, You don't know I can't. Have a little faith in me
14701,Jeremy, That's not fair. You can't harness the power of a hundred dead witches. It'll k*ll you
14702,Bonnie," Shh! We don't know that for certain. You promised to keep my secret, I'm trusting you. I'm going through with this, and if you tell anyone, I swear..."
14703,Jeremy, what? What are you gonna do?
14704,Elena," Hey, Jer. How you doing? Are you ok at the house alone with John?"
14705,Jeremy, It's not ideal
14706,Elena," You haven't heard from Jenna, have you?"
14707,Jeremy, It looks like she's staying on campus instead of coming home. I'm late for class
14708,Elena, What's going on?
14709,Bonnie, I told him he had to dress up tonight and he got all uptight
14710,Elena, Oh
14711,Dana," Hey, Elena, there you are. Ok. This is going to sound freaky, but this totally hot guy just asked me to ask you if you're going to the dance tonight"
14712,Bonnie, Tell him she has a boyfriend
14713,Dana, You could at least meet him. He'll be at the dance tonight. Look for him. His name is Klaus
14714,Elena," I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
14715,Dana," His name's Klaus. I know the name's stupid, but I swear he's hot"
14716,Bonnie, Where is he? Is he here?
14717,Dana, I don't know
14718,Bonnie, She's being compelled
14719,Dana, But he wants to know if you'll save him the last dance. How cute is that?
14720,Damon," So we go to the dance, we find him"
14721,Stefan, Really? How are we going to do that? We don't even know what he looks like
14722,Damon, Something tells me he's not going to be 16 and pimply
14723,Stefan, He could be anywhere at any time. He compelled somebody at school
14724,Stefan," I guess it's not as safe as you guys thought, huh?"
14725,Damon, There you are
14726,Alaric/Klaus, Sorry I'm late
14727,Damon," Hey, I need you to put me down as a chaperone at the dance tonight. Klaus made his first move"
14728,Elena," Ok, so we find him and then what, hmm? What's our plan of attack?"
14729,Bonnie," Me. I'm the plan. He has no idea how much power I can channel. If you can find him, I can k*ll him"
14730,Alaric/Klaus," That's not going to be that easy. I mean, he is the biggest, baddest vampire around"
14731,Damon," Alaric has a point. I mean, what if he..."
14732,Stefan," Well, I was impressed"
14733,Bonnie," It doesn't matter if he's an Original. I can take down anyone who comes at me. I can k*ll him, Elena. I know I can"
14734,Alaric/Klaus," Ah, you're right. This witch is all juiced up and aiming to k*ll"
14735,Katherine, That's terrible
14736,Alaric/Klaus," We're gonna have to k*ll her, Maddox"
14737,Alaric/Klaus, Do you think this Alaric guy has anything vintage?
14738,Alaric/Klaus," Crossbows, wooden b*ll*ts and automatics? Who is this guy, again?"
14739,Katherine, He's the local vampire hunter
14740,Alaric/Klaus," Ahh. Well, that explains the clothes"
14741,Maddox, All I could find. Guy likes his bourbon
14742,Alaric/Klaus, I knew there was something about him I liked. There's a high school dance and I'm gonna need you to take out witch bitch
14743,Maddox," If she has that much power, she can sense me coming from a mile away. I won't be able to get near her. You have to do it"
14744,Alaric/Klaus," In this body? I'm a Haggard history teacher. She can easily hurt me. I mean, not me, Klaus me, but you know what I mean"
14745,Maddox, No witch could handle channeling that much power. It'll k*ll her. It would k*ll me. You just have
14746,Alaric/Klaus, You mean like provoking her to death?
14747,Maddox," Won't take long. Just keep attacking her until it k*ll her. His body, Alaric's, will last longer than hers will"
14748,Alaric/Klaus, How? He's human
14749,Maddox, I can help in that department. I can do a spell to protect you
14750,Caroline, There you are! You almost missed me. How do I look?
14751,Liz, Jackie O?
14752,Caroline, Duh
14753,Liz, You look good
14754,Caroline, Thanks. Is everything ok?
14755,Liz," Ughh, just some work stress"
14756,Caroline," Well, you work too much"
14757,Caroline, Mr. President
14758,Matt, Hey
14759,Caroline, Hi
14760,Matt, Sheriff
14761,Caroline, Sorry
14762,Liz, Have fun
14763,Caroline, We will
14764,Elena, Your relatives were such packrats
14765,Elena," Ok, so what do you think? Twiggy or sexy hippy?"
14766,Stefan," Ooh. You know it's not too late to back out, right?"
14767,Elena," And what, miss out on all the fun?"
14768,Stefan, Hey
14769,Elena, All this time spent worrying about Klaus. I think I convinced myself that he's not real but he is
14770,Stefan," And tonight, we will put an end to him"
14771,Elena, I love you
14772,Stefan, I want you to tell me that when the night's over
14773,Damon, Any time tonight
14774,Dana," Nice outfit, Mr. Saltzman. Totally far out"
14775,Alaric/Klaus," Thank you, Dana. Thank you. Now who is your date?"
14776,Chad," It's Chad, Mr. Saltzman, from third period"
14777,Alaric/Klaus," Chad, of course. How would you and your friends like to earn a little extra credit?"
14778,Jeremy, Wait
14779,Jeremy," Look, I, um, I want you to have this"
14780,Bonnie," If you're asking me to go steady, I think that was the fifties"
14781,Jeremy," No, I'm serious, Bonnie"
14782,Bonnie," The ring won't work on me, Jeremy"
14783,Jeremy, But it was made by a witch
14784,Bonnie," To protect from the supernatural, not for someone who is"
14785,Jeremy," Well, I have to do something. I can't just... I can't just let you get yourself k*ll"
14786,Bonnie, Just because a bunch of dead witches gave me a warning doesn't mean I'm going to die
14787,Jeremy," So you're saying there's a 50-50 sh*t you won't? Look, I'm sorry. But... you know I don't have the best luck in the girlfriend department"
14788,Bonnie," Hey. Listen, I... I can't explain it. But I can feel them. I'm empowered, Jeremy, I can do this. I know I can. I'm strong enough"
14789,Bonnie, Damon
14790,Damon, Evenin'
14791,Elena," hey you two. Oh, you look nice"
14792,Bonnie, You too
14793,Stefan, You guys ready to do this?
14794,Dana," Thanks for being here, everybody. We have a special shout-out tonight"
14795,Dana, This is for Elena. From Klaus
14796,Damon," That was a lame, cheap sh*t. He's just trying to bait us"
14797,Elena, I know everyone here
14798,Stefan, Maybe he's not here. Just wants us to believe that he is
14799,Damon," It's a party, people. Blend. Let him come to us"
14800,Bonnie, Good idea
14801,Jeremy," No, no, I really don't feel like dancing"
14802,Bonnie, Too bad
14803,Damon, There's Ric. I'll be back
14804,Alaric/Klaus," Special dedication, huh? This guy's a little twisted"
14805,Damon, I'm not impressed
14806,Alaric/Klaus, No?
14807,Damon, Let me know if you see anything out of whack
14808,Elena, Caroline's here. They don't know what's going on. We have to tell her
14809,Stefan, I'm on it
14810,Damon, How you doing?
14811,Elena," Um, freaking out a bit. You?"
14812,Damon," Cool as a cucumber. Come on, remember the last decade dance? The vampires were all, ""ahh!"" And you were all, ""aahh!"""
14813,Elena, Right. And you won
14814,Damon, Yes! We did
14815,Elena, You're good at this
14816,Damon, I've got moves you've never seen
14817,Caroline, Dance with me
14818,Matt, I'm a really bad dancer
14819,Caroline, I know better than that
14820,Caroline, What?
14821,Matt, You look really pretty tonight
14822,Stefan," Hey, guys"
14823,Matt," Hey, man, what's up?"
14824,Stefan, Hey. Do you mind if I steal your date for a moment?
14825,Matt," No, not all. I'll get us something to drink"
14826,Stefan, Thanks
14827,Caroline, What's wrong?
14828,Stefan, Klaus is here
14829,Caroline, What?!
14830,Stefan, Yeah
14831,Caroline, Where?
14832,Stefan," We have no idea. But keep your eye out for anything that might be weird, ok?"
14833,Damon, May I?
14834,Bonnie," You heard Jeremy and me talking, didn't you?"
14835,Damon, Is it true?
14836,Bonnie, Yes
14837,Damon, The part about you having a 50-50 sh*t of surviving? Is that true?
14838,Bonnie, He was upset. I didn't want him to worry
14839,Damon," So you lay it out on the line for Elena, no matter what"
14840,Bonnie, No matter what
14841,Damon, Good
14842,Bonnie, You can't tell her
14843,Damon," Your secret's safe with me, but I mean... With all that power, isn't there a way to increase your odds?"
14844,Bonnie," Careful, Damon. I might start to think you actually care"
14845,Damon, We wouldn't want that
14846,Elena, What are they up to?
14847,Jeremy, Who knows?
14848,Elena," Is there something going on, Jer? You ok?"
14849,Jeremy, Fine. I'm fine
14850,Stefan, Everything all right?
14851,Elena, I'm not sure
14852,Stefan, Jeremy. What are you doing? Elena thinks we should stick together
14853,Jeremy," Yeah, I'm fine. I've got my ring. It's... it's Bonnie"
14854,Stefan," What is it? Hey, you got something on your mind, spit it out"
14855,Jeremy," If Bonnie takes on Klaus, channeling all that energy's going to k*ll her"
14856,Stefan, What?
14857,Jeremy," But she doesn't want Elena to know, 'cause if Elena knows, she's gonna try to stop her. And it's Elena that could turn up dead, so... What am I supposed to do?"
14858,Elena, I need to talk to you
14859,Stefan," Come here, come here, come here. Please tell me you didn't know that Bonnie was on a su1c1de mission"
14860,Damon," Oh, great. Jeremy told you and of course you told Elena"
14861,Stefan," Yeah, I told her. You promised her no more secrets"
14862,Damon, I changed my mind
14863,Elena, How could you not tell me?
14864,Bonnie, 'Cause I knew how'd you react
14865,Elena," No. No way, it's not an option"
14866,Bonnie, It's our only option
14867,Elena," Then we'll find another way, ok? Bonnie, you're not dying to save my life"
14868,Bonnie," I have the power to save you! If I don't use it and something happens, that would k*ll me more"
14869,Elena, I can't let you
14870,Bonnie," Just answer one question... if the situation was reversed, would you do it for me?"
14871,Bonnie, So you know I have to
14872,Elena, No. No!
14873,Jeremy," What's going on, guys?"
14874,Chad," You ok, Gilbert? You don't look so good"
14875,Jeremy," Dude, seriously? Wrong day, wrong guy"
14876,Damon, Let me guess... Klaus says hi
14877,Stefan," No, no, no, no, don't k*ll him. He's compelled"
14878,Damon, So?
14879,Stefan," So, the whole thing's a distraction. Go find Bonnie and Elena. I got this. Go"
14880,Alaric/Klaus, Elena!
14881,Elena, What is it?
14882,Alaric/Klaus, He has Jeremy
14883,Elena, What?
14884,Bonnie, What?!
14885,Alaric/Klaus," Yeah, Klaus has Jeremy. Come on"
14886,Elena," Ok, so where are you taking us?"
14887,Alaric/Klaus, Just a little further
14888,Elena, What... Something's not right
14889,Bonnie, Where's Jeremy?
14890,Alaric/Klaus," I just had to get away from that dance. The sixties, uchh. Not my decade"
14891,Alaric/Klaus," I mean, whose call was that, anyway? I much prefer the twenties. The style, the parties, the jazz"
14892,Elena, Alaric. Are you on vervain?
14893,Alaric/Klaus," Now why would you ask me that question, Elena?"
14894,Elena, He's being compelled
14895,Alaric/Klaus, Nope. Try again
14896,Elena, What's going on?
14897,Alaric/Klaus," Ok, I'll give you a hint. I am not Alaric"
14898,Elena, Klaus
14899,Alaric/Klaus, Surprise!
14900,Elena," Oh, no. No, it's not possible"
14901,Alaric/Klaus," Just relax, Elena. I'm not here to hurt you. You're not on my hit list tonight"
14902,Alaric/Klaus, But you are
14903,Alaric/Klaus," Now, did I mention that I knew a witch? You're gonna have to hit me a lot harder than that"
14904,Alaric/Klaus, By all means... Fire away!
14905,Alaric/Klaus," If you k*ll this body, I'll just get a new one. Maybe Jeremy"
14906,Bonnie, Go. Run. Run!
14907,Damon, What happened?
14908,Elena, Klaus is in Alaric's body
14909,Damon, What?
14910,Bonnie, He's possessing it or something
14911,Damon, Go find Stefan. Now
14912,Elena, Okay
14913,Damon, Now
14914,Damon, Can you k*ll him?
14915,Bonnie, He's got some kind of protection spell
14916,Damon, You have the power of a hundred witches. Break it
14917,Bonnie," I'm trying! If I k*ll Alaric, he'll just possess someone else. He knows I have my power, Damon. He's trying to k*ll me"
14918,Damon," No. Klaus does not get to win tonight, no way. You still willing to do whatever it takes to k*ll him?"
14919,Caroline, Hey! Are you ok?
14920,Elena, Um...Yeah. I'm just... I'm looking for Stefan
14921,Caroline," Seriously, what's wrong?"
14922,Elena," Uh, just, um, stay with Matt, ok?"
14923,Matt, What was that about?
14924,Caroline," Oh, you know, just same old drama"
14925,Alaric/Klaus," What took you so long? Now, do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?"
14926,Alaric/Klaus, The hard way. Got it
14927,Alaric/Klaus, What? You'd k*ll your favorite history teacher?
14928,Bonnie, It's what Alaric would want. And he'd want you to suffer first
14929,Alaric/Klaus, Look at you
14930,Alaric/Klaus, Is that all you got?
14931,Bonnie, Let's find out
14932,Damon, There you are
14933,Elena, What are you doing? Where's Bonnie?
14934,Damon, She's doing what she has to do
14935,Elena, What?
14936,Stefan, Where is she?
14937,Damon," Stefan, let her do this"
14938,Stefan," Damn it, Damon, where is she?!"
14939,Elena," Bonnie, no!"
14940,Elena," No! Oh! Bonnie! Bonnie, Bonnie!"
14941,Elena," Stefan, she's not breathing!"
14942,Elena," Stefan! Stefan, I can't find her pulse! Stefan! Do something, please! Stefan, please! Just give her bl*od, do something, please!"
14943,Stefan, It's too late. I'm sorry
14944,Elena," No! No. No, no, no, no, no! Bonnie! Bonnie, please, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
14945,Damon," Stefan, get Elena out of here. I'll deal with this"
14946,Elena," What do you mean, deal with this?"
14947,Damon, The sheriff can't know about this. Last thing we need's another mysterious death
14948,Elena, This is Bonnie!
14949,Damon, Get her home. Now
14950,Stefan," Hey, hey, hey"
14951,Elena," No. Jeremy. Oh, my God, Jeremy. What about Jeremy?"
14952,Damon, I'll find him
14953,Jeremy," Damon! Hey, I got your message, I can't find anyone. Where's Elena, where's Bonnie?"
14954,Damon, We need to have a little talk
14955,Stefan," Hey. Here, drink this"
14956,Elena, I can't
14957,Stefan," Yeah. Yeah, you can. Yeah. Yeah, you can"
14958,Elena, This is my fault
14959,Stefan," No, no, no, no, no. No. Hey. This was Klaus. Listen to me. Klaus did this"
14960,Elena, What did you do with her?!
14961,Damon, Will you please calm her down?
14962,Elena, Don't talk like I'm not standing right in front of you
14963,Damon, Please calm down
14964,Elena," You knew! Didn't you? You knew that if she harnessed all that power, that she would die, didn't you?"
14965,Damon," Yes. Yes, I knew"
14966,Damon," You need to listen to me, and prepare for what I'm about to say. Bonnie had to die. Klaus using Alaric's body was a total surprise. She wasn't prepared for that. And he wasn't going to stop, and we weren't going to be able to stop him until he knew she was dead. He had to believe it"
14967,Damon," She cast a spell. She's alive, Elena. Bonnie's ok"
14968,Stefan," You know, you could have told me"
14969,Damon, How do I know when you're going to go blabbing things to your girlfriend?
14970,Stefan, You even understand what you put her through?
14971,Damon," See, that's why I didn't tell you. 'Cause you would have never been able to do it. Don't get me wrong, Stefan. I don't mind being the bad guy. I'll make all the life and death decisions while you're busy worrying about collateral damage. I'll even let her hate me for it. But at the end of the day, I'll be the one to keep her alive"
14972,Jeremy, You sure it's safe here?
14973,Bonnie," Yeah, I'm sure"
14974,Bonnie, What is that?
14975,Jeremy," It is MiFi. If we're gonna be stuck here, then we might as well have Internet"
14976,Bonnie, You don't have to stay down here with me
14977,Jeremy," Hey, look, I'm not letting you out of my sight"
14978,Bonnie, I... I need you to talk to Elena for me. Tell her how sorry I am for what Damon and I had to do
14979,Jeremy," Well, um... Why don't you tell her yourself?"
14980,Bonnie," Elena, I'm so sorry"
14981,Elena," It's ok, it's ok. I just needed to see you from myself"
14982,Bonnie, There wasn't enough time for me to tell you 
14983,Elena," It's ok, seriously. Damon explained it all to me"
14984,Damon, Ugh. Look. Klaus had to think she was dead. Your reaction had to be real
14985,Elena," I understand why you did what you did. Klaus was fooled, and Bonnie's alive"
14986,Damon, Here's to duplicity
14987,Elena," But let's get one thing straight, Damon. Bonnie will not die for me, I will not let that happen"
14988,Damon," We need to k*ll Klaus, Elena. Real Klaus. Who will probably be coming to pay you a visit soon now that he knows that Bonnie is dead. She's the only one who can do it"
14989,Elena, We'll find another way
14990,Damon, I hope so
14991,Elena," Look, I shouldn't have hit you"
14992,Damon," Apology accepted. Let me be clear about something. If it comes down to you and the witch again, I will gladly let Bonnie die. I will always choose you"
14993,Elena," Good night, Damon"
14994,Damon, Good night
14995,Elijah, Katerina!
14996,Elijah," Ah, good evening, Trevor. I am pleased you could join us"
14997,Trevor, I could not miss the birthday celebration
14998,Elijah," No, considering the gift you claim to bear. Where is this mystery girl of which you speak?"
14999,Trevor, Right this way
15000,Trevor, My dear
15001,Katherine, Hello
15002,Elena," Elijah! It's me, it's Elena"
15003,Elijah," Oh, my God"
15004,Elijah, Forgive me. You remind me of someone
15005,Trevor," Katerina, may I introduce the lord Elijah"
15006,Katherine," Pleasure, my lord"
15007,Elijah, The pleasure's mine. Katerina
15008,Elijah, I can't-- I can't breathe! What's happening to me?
15009,Elijah, I can't... I can't be in this house
15010,Elena, You're not invited in
15011,Elijah, I can't be in here
15012,Elijah, What happened?
15013,Elena, Shh!
15014,Elena, I'll tell you. Not here. Can I trust you?
15015,Elijah, Can I trust you?
15016,Stefan, Elena!
15017,Stefan, Hey
15018,Andie, Hey
15019,Stefan, Have you seen Elena?
15020,Andie," Uh, no"
15021,Damon," Hi, sweetie. Oh, my coffee"
15022,Damon, Good morning
15023,Andie," Mm, good morning"
15024,Stefan," Hey, where's Elena?"
15025,Damon," I don't know, Stefan. It's your girlfriend. Mine's right here"
15026,Damon," Oh, and how's the shoulder? Got time for a bite? I'm so hungry"
15027,Andie," Oh, it's really messy. Can you just use a bl*od bag today?"
15028,Andie, I'm already late for work
15029,Damon, No!
15030,Stefan," Hey, it's me. Where are you? Call me"
15031,Stefan, What are you doing? She's not a wind-up toy
15032,Andie," It's really none of your business, is it, Stefan?"
15033,Damon, Yeah. What she said
15034,Andie, I have to go to work
15035,Damon, Ugh! Bye
15036,Damon," No, she didn't"
15037,Maddox, I'll be back as soon as I can
15038,Klaus/Alaric," Yes, do hurry. I'm anxious to get out of this body. And if you get hung up, call me. You know how impatient I get"
15039,Katherine, Where is he going?
15040,Klaus/Alaric, To retrieve me. So I can get out of this bad hair-do
15041,Katherine," Are you sure that's a good idea, Klaus?"
15042,Klaus/Alaric," Well, the full moon is almost upon us"
15043,Klaus/Alaric," I've k*ll the witch, I have the moon stone, and the doppelganger is waiting in the wings. Ohh, I am ready to break this curse"
15044,Katherine, And why would you do that here? There's so many people that would try to stop you
15045,Klaus/Alaric, Because I have to. It's the birth place of the doppelganger
15046,Katherine, I didn't realize that was a requirement
15047,Klaus/Alaric," Well, how could you? You betrayed me and fled England before I could give you the details, Katerina. But I did find your birth place and I slaughtered your family. So I guess we're cool. Let's just hope that Elena isn't as stupid as you are"
15048,Katherine, She won't run. She'll die before she lets anyone that she loves get hurt
15049,Klaus/Alaric, And that's exactly what I'm counting on
15050,Klaus/Alaric, You can't leave until I tell you to
15051,Elena, You look better
15052,Elijah, Where did you get the dagger?
15053,Elena," I'll tell you everything. But we have to work together, Elijah. I need your word"
15054,Elijah, Your ability to make demands has long passed
15055,Elena," No demands. I'm offering you my help. And in return, I want yours"
15056,Elijah, And why should I even consider this?
15057,Elena, The same reason that you haven't k*ll me. You need my help to k*ll Klaus. And I need you
15058,Stefan, Where are you? Are you ok?
15059,Elena," Yes, I'm fine"
15060,Stefan, Where's Elijah?
15061,Elena, He's right here
15062,Stefan, Where? I'm on my way
15063,Elena," No, Stefan, Elijah and I need some time alone"
15064,Stefan, Listen to me. He can't be trusted He'll use you to get to Klaus
15065,Elena," Elijah is a noble man, Stefan. He lives by a code of honor. I can trust him. He knows that I'd be incredibly stupid to betray him again. By removing the dagger, I have proven myself"
15066,Stefan, You can't do this alone
15067,Elena," It's my decision, Stefan. Please respect it. And make sure that Damon doesn't do anything stupid. I'll be in touch"
15068,Damon, Did she just hang up on you?
15069,Stefan, She did
15070,Damon, She's lost it
15071,Stefan," If anyone can get him to help us k*ll Klaus, it's her"
15072,Damon," Bonnie's the way to k*ll Klaus, Stefan. He thinks she's dead. We have a chance with her"
15073,Stefan, She'll k*ll herself in the process. Elena's looking for another way
15074,Damon, Her way's going to get her k*ll. So we need to find her and stop her
15075,Stefan," No, you need to back off"
15076,Damon, What?!
15077,Stefan," Look, I don't like this any more than you do. But we need to trust her. We gotta just let her do her thing"
15078,Damon, That might be your plan. Mine's better
15079,Stefan, I said back off
15080,Elena, He's here
15081,Elijah, Klaus is here?
15082,Elena, He's taken over Alaric's body
15083,Elijah, Of course he has. One of his favorite tricks
15084,Elena," Well, what are his other tricks? What is he going to do next? You're the only one who knows him"
15085,Elijah," Yes, I do"
15086,Katherine, So where is this mysterious host I've heard so much about?
15087,Elijah, Fashionably late. He likes to make an entrance
15088,Elijah, Here he is
15089,Elijah," Katerina, may I introduce to you the lord Nicklaus"
15090,Klaus, Nicklaus is the name my father gave me. Please. Call me Klaus
15091,Carol," Elijah, Elena! What are you doing here? What happened?"
15092,Elijah," I've had a bit of an incident, Carol. I'm hoping you could help"
15093,Carol," Well, I'm on my way to a meeting, so I—"
15094,Elijah, We won't take but a minute of your time
15095,Carol, Of course. Anything you need
15096,Elijah, Thank you
15097,Elijah," Well, first things first. I'm going to need a change of clothing"
15098,Carol," Well, we can try one of my husband's suits. I haven't boxed them up yet"
15099,Elijah, Wonderful
15100,Elena, How did you know she's not on vervain?
15101,Elijah, 'Cause I'm the one who got her off it. Right before you and your friends k*ll me. Twice. If you'll excuse me. I'll be done in a moment
15102,Stefan, Hello?
15103,Jenna," Hey, Stefan. It's Jenna"
15104,Stefan," Jenna, hey"
15105,Jenna, Where's Elena? And Jeremy? No one's answering their phones
15106,Stefan," Ah, Elena's not here at the moment. Is, uh, is everything ok?"
15107,Jenna, She left me all these weird messages telling me to stay away from Rick. What's going on?
15108,Stefan," It's really hard to explain over the phone, but, um, she was hoping that you could stay on campus for a little while longer"
15109,Jenna," Oh, that's kinda hard to do from my kitchen"
15110,Stefan," Wait, you're home?"
15111,Jenna," Yeah. What's going on? Where's Elena? I'm supposed to meet Rick at the grill for lunch, to talk"
15112,Stefan," Jenna, listen to me carefully. Whatever you do, do not meet Alaric at the grill. I'm going to come over right now and I'll explain everything"
15113,Damon," Wow, I'd love to lend you a hand, but you wouldn't want me doing anything stupid"
15114,Stefan, It's seriously going to be like this?
15115,Damon," You and your girlfriend are calling the shots. I'm just backing off, Stefan"
15116,Damon, Hi
15117,Andie, Hi
15118,Damon, Let's go
15119,Andie, Where are we going?
15120,Damon, Splitting from the team. Going rogue. Come on
15121,Elijah, So I assume that the Martin witches are no longer with us
15122,Elena, No. I'm sorry
15123,Elijah, And Katerina? She would have been released from my compulsion when I died
15124,Elena, Klaus took her. We think that she may be dead
15125,Elijah, I doubt that. Not Klaus' style. Death would be too easy for her after what she did
15126,Elena," I don't understand. You say that you want Klaus dead, but you still made Katherine pay for betraying him"
15127,Elijah, I have my own reasons for wanting Katerina to pay. There was a time... I'd have done anything for Klaus
15128,Klaus," From where have you come, Katerina?"
15129,Katherine," I'm new to town, my lord"
15130,Elijah, Katerina is from Bulgaria
15131,Klaus," Zradevei, Katerina"
15132,Katherine, Very good
15133,Klaus," Do you mind, brother? I would like to have a moment alone with her"
15134,Elijah," Not at all. Happy Birthday, brother"
15135,Elijah, Yes. Klaus is my brother
15136,Elena, I heard that. I'm still processing
15137,Elijah," Yes, I'm a little behind on the times, but I believe the term you're searching for is ""O.M.G."""
15138,Andie," Alaric, are you home? Andie-- Starr, Jenna's friend"
15139,Katherine, Thank God
15140,Andie, Wow! You were right. She looks exactly like Elena
15141,Damon, Yep
15142,Damon, Thought you might be dead
15143,Katherine, Unfortunately not
15144,Stefan," Hey, Jenna. Thank you so much for not going to the grill"
15145,Jenna," Um, Stefan…"
15146,Stefan," No, listen. I can explain"
15147,Klaus/Alaric," Hi, Stefan. How's it going?"
15148,Elena, There's a whole family of Originals?
15149,Elijah, My father was a wealthy land owner in a village in Eastern Europe. Our mother bore seven children
15150,Elena, So your parents were human?
15151,Elijah," Our whole family was. Our origin as vampires is a very long story, Elena. Just know... We're the oldest vampires in the world. We are the Original family, and from us all, vampires were created"
15152,Elena," Right, but Klaus is your brother. And you want him dead?"
15153,Elijah, I need some air. I'm still feeling a tad... dead. Come
15154,Katherine, What are you doing here?
15155,Andie, We are here to rescue you
15156,Damon," No, sweetie. We are here to see if she deserves to be rescued"
15157,Andie, Right
15158,Damon, I figured you still might be kicking. Alari-Klaus was blending way too easily. Figured he probably had some coaching
15159,Katherine, Is that...
15160,Damon, Vervain? Your salvation
15161,Katherine, It's not going to undo anything
15162,Damon, There's always a loophole. Did he tell you to stay in this apartment until he said it was ok to leave?
15163,Damon, You can't say. Did he tell you to do absolutely everything he says until the end of time?
15164,Katherine, No
15165,Damon, There's your loophole. Drink this and prevent any further compulsion
15166,Katherine, Give it to me
15167,Damon," Answer one question first. You double-crossed us with Isobel, why?"
15168,Katherine," I didn't think you could stand a chance against Klaus, so I was looking out for myself"
15169,Damon, And where did that get you? Here
15170,Damon," Be careful with that. If he finds out you have that, you're never getting out of here"
15171,Damon, You owe me. And I will collect
15172,Damon, Come on
15173,Andie, Nice to meet you
15174,Klaus/Alaric," You know, I find chopping... Calming. The feel of the blade in the hand, maybe"
15175,Jenna, I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what the hell's going on
15176,Klaus/Alaric," Well, would you like to tell her, Stefan, or should I?"
15177,Jenna, Tell me what?
15178,Klaus/Alaric," Do you believe in vampires, Jenna? No?"
15179,Klaus/Alaric," Well, who does, right? But believe it or not, they do have a place in our history. And as a history teacher, I find them fascinating"
15180,Jenna, Why are we talking about this?
15181,Klaus/Alaric," Well, you've been angry with me for keeping secrets, and this is one of my secrets. I'm obsessed with vampires. There. I said it"
15182,Jenna, Are you joking?
15183,Klaus/Alaric," Not at all. How about you, Stefan? Are you a fan of vampires?"
15184,Stefan," In literature. Bram Stoker. It's dense, but I appreciate it"
15185,Klaus/Alaric," Hmm. Did you know that vampires are the oldest creatures of the night? Except for werewolves, of course"
15186,Jenna, Werewolves. Werewolves. Now I know you're joking
15187,Klaus/Alaric," You know, I've read that there's an Aztec curse on both species that keeps werewolves slaves to the Moon and vampires bound by the Sun. Isn't that right, Stefan? You know, they say these creatures would do anything to have this curse broken and that they wouldn't care who they had to k*ll to do it"
15188,Elijah," So as you've seen, nothing can k*ll an Original. Not Sun, not fire, not even a werewolf bite. Only the wood from one tree. A tree my family made sure b*rned"
15189,Elena, That's where the white ash for the dagger comes from
15190,Elijah, Yes. The witches won't allow anything truly immortal to walk the earth. Every creature needs
15191,Elena, So the Sun can't k*ll an Original. Why is Klaus so obsessed with breaking the Sun and Moon curse?
15192,Elijah," Right. The curse of the Sun and the Moon. It's all so... Biblical-sounding, don't you think?"
15193,Elena, What's so funny?
15194,Elijah, Look what I found. The Roman parchment
15195,Klaus," I remember etching this scroll. Well, I was quite blistered from drink"
15196,Elijah, Your finest work remains your Aztec drawings
15197,Klaus, Not the African carvings? 'Cause I was quite proud of those
15198,Elijah, The Aztec. Who can resist a shaman?
15199,Klaus, Yes
15200,Elena, I don't understand. So Klaus drew the Aztec sketches about the curse?
15201,Elijah," Roman scrolls, African tribal etchings, and any other culture or continent we felt like planting in it"
15202,Elena, But why?
15203,Elijah," Easiest way to discover the existence of a doppelganger or to get your hands on some long, lost moon stone is to have every single member of two warring species on the lookout"
15204,Elena, So it's not Aztec at all?
15205,Elijah, The curse of the sun and the Moon... is fake. It doesn't exist
15206,Elena, What?
15207,Klaus/Alaric," Oh, I know this all sounds so crazy, but... vampires are real. Would you care for some more wine?"
15208,Jenna, Get out
15209,Klaus/Alaric, Excuse me?
15210,Jenna," I don't know what it is you're trying to do or why you're saying these things, but…"
15211,Klaus/Alaric, Jenna…
15212,Jenna, I said get out!
15213,Stefan, You heard her
15214,Klaus/Alaric, I'm afraid I don't want to
15215,Jenna, Fine! I'll go
15216,Klaus/Alaric, You're not going anywhere
15217,Jenna, Stefan!
15218,Stefan," Jenna, get out of here now!"
15219,Klaus/Alaric," You can't k*ll me, Stefan"
15220,Stefan, Watch me!
15221,Jenna, Stefan!
15222,Klaus/Alaric," I may not have a witch protecting me today, but if you k*ll this body, what's to stop me from choosing Jenna as my next one?"
15223,Stefan," Jenna, go"
15224,Jenna, But you're… you…
15225,Stefan, I said go!
15226,Klaus/Alaric, k*ll me. Just remind Elena how easy it will be for me to get my revenge if she tries to stop me from breaking this curse
15227,Elijah, Klaus and I faked the Sun and Moon curse dating back over a thousand years
15228,Elena, But if there's no curse...
15229,Elijah, There's a curse. Just not that one. The real one's much worse. It's a curse placed on Klaus
15230,Elena, What are you talking about?
15231,Elijah, Klaus has been trying to break it for the last thousand years. You are his only hope
15232,Elena, What is this curse?
15233,Elijah," Your phone will not stop its incessant buzzing. Answer it, please"
15234,Elena," Stefan… what's wrong? No. No, no, no, no. Ok, I'll be right there"
15235,Elena, Klaus went after Jenna. I have to go to her
15236,Elijah, I'm afraid that wasn't part of today's arrangement
15237,Elena," She's my family, Elijah. I have to. I'll be back. You have my word"
15238,Elijah, That doesn't mean anything to me until you live up to it
15239,Elena, Thank you
15240,Katherine, You have to chase me!
15241,Katherine, You're meant to catch me
15242,Elijah," But if I catch you, the game will be over"
15243,Katherine, Thank you for entertaining me
15244,Elijah," You seemed lonely inside, so I took pity on you"
15245,Katherine," Klaus promised to spend the day with me, but he never returned home from the night"
15246,Elijah," Yes, Klaus does not live by any rules but his own"
15247,Katherine," He is a very charming man. Hard for anyone to resist, I suppose"
15248,Elijah, And yet...
15249,Katherine, I know not why he courts me. He seems to not care about me at all
15250,Elijah, Many a union has been built on much less
15251,Katherine, Is it wrong to want more?
15252,Elijah, Did you have more with Trevor?
15253,Katherine," Trevor believes that he loves me, but true love is not real unless it's returned. Do you agree?"
15254,Elijah," I do not believe in love, Katerina"
15255,Katherine," That is too sad for me to accept, my lord. Life is too cruel. If we cease to believe in love, why would we want to live?"
15256,Klaus, What do I interrupt?
15257,Elijah, He's returned
15258,Elijah, Long night
15259,Katherine, What has happened?
15260,Klaus, The wrong village picked a fight at the tavern
15261,Elena," Oh, Jenna, thank God"
15262,Jenna, No
15263,Elena, I never meant for any of this to happen
15264,Jenna," When I was little, your mom used to tell me bedtime stories. Stories about vampires. I never thought that what she said could be true"
15265,Elena," It is true, Jenna. I should have told you. I thought that if you didn't know, you'd be safe. But then things got so out of control and everything I had done to keep you out of it, it just blew up in my face"
15266,Jenna, Who else knows? Jeremy?
15267,Jenna, John?
15268,Elena, We were just trying to protect you
15269,Jenna, Protect me?
15270,Elena, I'm so sorry. I will tell you everything
15271,Jenna," No, Elena... I am the one who's supposed to be protecting you and Jeremy"
15272,Elena," I know, but there's nothing that you could have done. There's so much more to it…"
15273,Jenna," no, this is-- this is so… I don't know how… it's…"
15274,Elena," I know, hey"
15275,Jenna, Why didn't you tell me?! I'm scared
15276,Elena," I know. I know. I know, hey. Hey. I'm sorry. Jenna, I am so, so sorry"
15277,Stefan, Is she gonna be ok?
15278,Elena," She's in shock. I tried to tell her as much as I could, but I barely scratched the surface"
15279,Stefan," I'm so sorry, Elena. I hate this"
15280,Elena," It's not your fault, Stefan. It's mine. Anyway... I have to go back to Elijah"
15281,Stefan," Wait, what? No, no!"
15282,Elena," Stefan, I promised him that I would return. I can't break that promise"
15283,Stefan, Oh
15284,Elena, I'll be ok
15285,Damon, Where do you think you're going?
15286,Elena, Back to Elijah
15287,Damon, No
15288,Elena," Get out of my way, Dam..."
15289,Damon, if you so much as try and take a step out of this house...
15290,Andie," Damon, easy"
15291,Damon," Stay out of this, Andie"
15292,Stefan, Let her go
15293,Damon, Are you kidding me? We just got her back
15294,Stefan, You heard me. I said let her go
15295,Damon, That's twice today you've stood in my way. I wouldn't try a third
15296,Klaus/Alaric, You mind turning that down?
15297,Katherine, Why so grumpy?
15298,Klaus/Alaric," Well, this body has outlived its usefulness"
15299,Katherine, Do you want a drink?
15300,Klaus/Alaric," No, Katerina, I don't want a drink"
15301,Katherine, Come on. It might loosen you up
15302,Klaus/Alaric, What I want is for you to sit down and shut up
15303,Klaus/Alaric," Maddox, what took you so long?"
15304,Maddox, You've got a lot of luggage
15305,Klaus/Alaric, Greta. Finally
15306,Greta," Hello, love. Nice body. You ready to get out of it?"
15307,Elijah, Welcome back
15308,Elena, Tell me. What is Klaus' curse?
15309,Elena, Please
15310,Elijah," My family was quite close, but Klaus and my father did not get on too well. When we became vampires, we discovered the truth. Klaus was not my father's son. My mother had been unfaithful many years before. This was her darkest secret. Klaus is from a different bloodline. Of course, when my father discovered this, he hunted down and he k*ll my mother's lover and his entire family. Not realizing, of course, that he was igniting a w*r between species that rages until this day"
15311,Elena, A w*r between the species?
15312,Elijah, The vampires... and the werewolves
15313,Elena, So Klaus' real father was from a werewolf bloodline? What does that make Klaus? A werewolf? Or a vampire?
15314,Elijah," He's both. A hybrid would be deadlier than any werewolf or vampire. Nature would not stand for such an imbalance of power. Therefore the witches, the servants of nature, saw to it that my brother's werewolf side would become dormant"
15315,Elena, That's the curse that Klaus wants to break?
15316,Elijah," He wants to trigger that part of him that's a werewolf. If allowed, Klaus would sire his own bloodline. He'd build his own race. Endangering not just vampires, but everyone"
15317,Elena, But you helped him
15318,Elijah," I helped him because I loved him. That's changed, now he must die"
15319,Elena, We have the dagger now. We can stop him
15320,Elijah," When a werewolf is wounded by silver, it heals. An Original can't be k*ll by anything but white oak ash on a silver dagger. So you see the conundrum. The dagger does not work"
15321,Elena," What, are you saying that Klaus can't be k*ll?"
15322,Elijah, There's one way to k*ll any supernatural species… at the hands of the servants of nature themselves
15323,Elena, A witch if they can channel that much power. But it would k*ll them
15324,Elijah, The curse must be broken during the full moon. When Klaus is in transition. That's when he'll be at his most vulnerable. A witch with enough power... can k*ll Klaus
15325,Elena, What if I told you that I knew a witch that could channel that much power?
15326,Elijah, Then I would tell you there's one more thing that you should know
15327,Klaus," The full moon is tomorrow, brother. After all these centuries, it is finally time"
15328,Elijah, I have been to see the witches. They believe they may have found a way to spare the doppelganger
15329,Klaus, What does it matter if she lives or not? She's a means to an end that is all
15330,Elijah," What, she should die for your gain?"
15331,Klaus, She is human. Her life means nothing
15332,Elijah, I beg you to consider this
15333,Klaus, Are you so foolish as to care for her?
15334,Elijah, Of course not
15335,Klaus," Love is a vampire's greatest weakness, and we are not weak, Elijah. We do not feel, and we do not care"
15336,Elijah, We did once. Too many lifetimes ago to matter. Tell the witches not to bother. The sacrifice will happen as planned
15337,Elena, You found a way to save the life of the doppelganger?
15338,Elijah," Yes, Elena. I did. But unfortunately, Katerina took matters into her own hands first. I believe you already know how that played out"
15339,Elena," You cared about her, didn't you?"
15340,Elijah," It's a common mistake, I'm told. And it's one I won't make again"
15341,Andie," You don't have to be so mad at your brother. You know, he's worried about Elena, and..."
15342,Damon," Just go, please"
15343,Andie," I know you're worried about her, too"
15344,Damon, Andie. Go
15345,Andie, Okay
15346,Stefan, Tired of your little play thing already?
15347,Damon," Don't start with me, Stefan. She's just my distraction"
15348,Stefan, She's a person. You're v*ctim her
15349,Damon, You should be thankful she's here. She keeps me from going for what I really want
15350,Stefan, You're right. Thank you for being in love with my girlfriend
15351,Damon, And there it is
15352,Stefan," There it is. You know, you can be in love with Elena all you want... If it means that you'll protect her. But I have the one thing that you never will"
15353,Damon," Oh, yeah? What's that?"
15354,Stefan, Her respect
15355,Elena, Stop!
15356,Klaus, What have you done?
15357,Elijah, I don't understand
15358,Klaus, Katerina has gone. She has fled
15359,Elijah, No
15360,Klaus, What did you tell her?
15361,Elijah, I told her nothing
15362,Klaus, Do not lie to me!
15363,Elijah, I will find her. You have my word
15364,Klaus," If you do not, I give you my word you will be dead"
15365,Damon, Now you've invited him in?
15366,Elena, Elijah and I have renewed the terms of our deal
15367,Damon, Really?
15368,Elijah, The two of you will come to no harm at my hands. I only ask for one thing in return
15369,Damon, What?
15370,Elijah, An apology
15371,Damon, A what?
15372,Stefan, I'm sorry for the part that I played in your death. I was protecting Elena. I will always protect Elena
15373,Elijah, I understand
15374,Elena," Sacrifice is going to happen, Damon. Bonnie will be able to k*ll Klaus without hurting herself and Elijah knows how to save my life. I told you I'd find another way. And I did"
15375,Damon, Is that true?
15376,Elijah, It is
15377,Damon, And you're trusting him?
15378,Elena, I am
15379,Damon, You can all go to hell
15380,Stefan, He's angry with me right now. But he'll come around
15381,Elijah, Perhaps
15382,Damon, I thought I told you to leave
15383,Andie, You didn't compel me. I want to be here. Just let me be here
15384,Damon, I'm upset. And you know what happens when I'm upset. You have to leave
15385,Andie," No. You need to know that somebody cares about you. I care about you, Damon"
15386,Damon, Hey. Hey. Look at me
15387,Damon," Get out of here, before I k*ll you. Just go. Go. Now!"
15388,Alaric, Elena?
15389,Klaus, Now that's more like it
15390,Elijah, Tonight is the full moon. We should assume that Klaus is prepared to break the curse
15391,Stefan, Elena said that the Sun and the Moon curse is fake? That it's actually just a curse placed on Klaus
15392,Elijah, Klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline. The curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting. But if he breaks it... He'll be a true hybrid
15393,Damon, Then why are we letting him break the curse? We can k*ll him today. With Bonnie
15394,Stefan, Damon...
15395,Elena, No. Bonnie can't use that much power without dying
15396,Damon, I'll write her a great eulogy
15397,Elena," It's not an option, Damon"
15398,Stefan," All right, how do we break this curse?"
15399,Elijah," Well, the ritual itself is relatively straightforward. The ingredients, so to speak, you already know"
15400,Stefan, The moonstone
15401,Elijah," A witch will channel the power of the full moon to release the spell that's bound within the stone. After that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire, will sacrifice one of each"
15402,Elena, And where do I fit into it?
15403,Elijah, The final part of the ritual
15404,Elijah, Klaus must drink the bl*od of the doppelganger... To the point of your death
15405,Elena, And that's where you come in
15406,Elijah, This is an elixir that I acquired some 500 years ago for Katerina. It possesses mystical properties of resuscitation
15407,Elena, So I'll be dead?
15408,Elijah, And then you won't
15409,Damon, That's your plan? A magical witch potion with no expiration date?
15410,Damon," You want to come back to life, what about John's ring?"
15411,Elijah," Those rings only work on humans. The doppelganger's a supernatural occurrence. Odds are, the ring won't work"
15412,Damon," I'll take those odds over your elixir. What if it doesn't work, Elena?"
15413,Elena, Then I guess I'll just be dead
15414,Elena, Do we know if Klaus has everything he needs to do this? Does he have a werewolf?
15415,Elijah," Klaus has been waiting to break this curse for over a thousand years. If he doesn't already have a werewolf, my guess is by tonight, he will"
15416,Carol," Tyler, honey. It's your mother. I don't know where you are, but I need you. I've had an accident and I'm in the hospital"
15417,Carol," Please, Tyler, come home"
15418,Carol, Why did I say that?
15419,Maddox, Because you had a terrible fall
15420,Stefan," Breakfast of champions, huh?"
15421,Damon, I'm surrounded by idiots. I need all the help I can get
15422,Stefan," You know, you're not helping"
15423,Damon," Elijah is an original vampire, Stefan. One we tried to k*ll. You're going to believe this guy?"
15424,Stefan," What do you want me to do, Damon? Elena made her decision. She's choosing to trust Elijah. I'm going to put my faith in her"
15425,Damon, Why? She's going to end up dead
15426,Stefan," Because she put her faith in me. She chose to trust me in spite of what I am. I'm going to bet on somebody's instincts, it's going to be hers"
15427,Damon," Well, then, that makes you the biggest idiot of them all"
15428,Stefan," She chose to trust you, too"
15429,Damon, Then maybe you shouldn't be so sure about her instincts
15430,Elena, You'd think he'd understand why I'm willing to do this
15431,Elijah, Why are you?
15432,Elena," I'm the key to breaking the curse. Klaus is here because of me. If I don't stop him, then he's going to hurt people. It's that simple"
15433,Elijah," You know, there's a possibility this elixir won't work. I don't want to mislead you"
15434,Elena, I know the chance I'm taking
15435,Alaric," Jenna, put the cross-bow down, ok? It's me"
15436,Jenna, Stay away from me
15437,Elena, What's going on?
15438,Alaric," It's me, Elena, I swear, ok? He let me go. Klaus let me go"
15439,Damon, Prove it
15440,Alaric," Ok, uh, first night you and I spent together, Jeremy walked in right when I was about to..."
15441,Jenna, it's him
15442,Stefan, Why did he let you go?
15443,Alaric, He wanted me to deliver a message. The sacrifice happens tonight
15444,Carol, Tyler?
15445,Tyler, Mom
15446,Carol, You're back
15447,Tyler, I'm back
15448,Matt, Ohh. Jeez!
15449,Caroline, Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you
15450,Matt," It's ok, I just, I didn't know you were here"
15451,Caroline," Yeah, I wanted to try and catch you on your break so we could hang out"
15452,Matt, I have lunch in an hour
15453,Caroline, Perfect. I will go run some errands and I will be right back
15454,Caroline, I'll see you in a bit
15455,Matt, Ok
15456,Sheriff Forbes, Does she suspect anything?
15457,Matt," No, but... I can't do this anymore. I've been with her the past few days, and I'm putting on the best show of my life. But either she is too, or she's still the same Caroline"
15458,Sheriff Forbes, She's not the same. She's a vampire
15459,Matt," At this point, I don't even know what that means"
15460,Sheriff Forbes," Look, I know this is hard to understand, but my family, we were raised with this. They're monsters, Matt. They have no soul, no humanity"
15461,Matt, There's nothing about her that makes me believe that
15462,Sheriff Forbes," It's an act. I believed Damon Salvatore was my closest ally in this town. Instead, he's a k*ll. They k*ll your sister. What other proof do you need?"
15463,Matt," I could ask you the same question, sheriff. Why haven't you done anything? Why are you hesitating?"
15464,Sheriff Forbes," Because I need more information. And because, in spite of everything I just said, I still look at her and I... I see my daughter"
15465,Matt," Damon is the problem, not Caroline. You should focus on him"
15466,Sheriff Forbes," I shouldn't have involved you, Matt. Thank you for all of your help, but I'll take it from here"
15467,Stefan, So you don't remember anything that happened?
15468,Alaric, No. It's like I blacked out and woke up 3 days later. Katherine was there
15469,Stefan," She's under compulsion. Damon snuck her some vervain, but she can't leave until Klaus tells her she can"
15470,Elena, Where is Damon?
15471,Jenna, I saw him go upstairs
15472,Alaric, So what else did I do?
15473,Elena, You disappeared
15474,Damon, I don't want to hear anymore
15475,Elena, I need you to understand why I'm doing this
15476,Damon, Why? It clearly doesn't matter what I think
15477,Elena," I'll be fine, Damon. I'll drink the elixir, Bonnie will k*ll Klaus and then all of this will finally be over"
15478,Damon, If it works
15479,Elena, It will work
15480,Damon, You think it will work. You want it to work. Why am I the only one who's convinced it won't? There has to be another way
15481,Elena, There isn't
15482,Damon," And you're going to die, Elena"
15483,Elena, And then I'll come back to life
15484,Damon, That is not a risk I'm willing to take
15485,Elena, But I am
15486,Elena," It's my life, Damon. My choice"
15487,Damon, I can't lose you
15488,Elena, You won't
15489,Damon, There is another way
15490,Elena, What are you...
15491,Elena," Damon, no!"
15492,Stefan, What did you do?! Huh? What did you do?!
15493,Damon, I saved her life
15494,Damon," You're so bent on dying, at least this way I know you'll come back"
15495,Stefan, As a vampire! She'll come back a vampire
15496,Damon, It's better than nothing else
15497,Stefan," How could you, of all people, take that choice away from her?"
15498,Damon," Go ahead; wish me an eternity of misery. Believe me, you'll get over it"
15499,Elena, Stefan!
15500,Damon, Admit it. You just wish you had the balls to do it yourself
15501,Elena, Get out of here!
15502,Alaric, What the hell's going on?
15503,Elena, Just get him out of here!
15504,Jenna," Oh, my God"
15505,Alaric," Ok, Jenna, downstairs are some bl*od bags. Go get them now. Go!"
15506,Elena, It's ok. It's ok. You're going to be ok
15507,Stefan, I'm so sorry
15508,Elena, Shh. It's ok
15509,Stefan, I'm sorry
15510,Elijah," Well, it sounds like you won't be needing this anymore. Feeding her vampire bl*od rendered it useless. Tell Elena I'll be back before nightfall. We'll proceed as planned"
15511,Damon, We both know that elixir wouldn't have worked anyway
15512,Elijah," The problem, Damon, you talk a good game but you don't actually know anything. She'll never forgive you. And never for a vampire... It's a very long time"
15513,Stefan, Thank you. Both of you
15514,Alaric," Yeah, well, we'll be downstairs"
15515,Alaric," I know it's, uh, it's a lot to take in"
15516,Jenna, Yeah
15517,Alaric," I tried to protect you from all this, but I should have known you could handle it"
15518,Jenna, Can I?
15519,Alaric," Well, you just did. Look, Jenna... I know we have a lot to talk about"
15520,Jenna, Hey. I'm glad you're ok. I should have said that already
15521,Elena, How could he do that to me? Why?
15522,Stefan, Hey. We've never talked about this. What this all means
15523,Elena, It doesn't matter
15524,Stefan, Of course it matters. Hey. It matters. I want you to go somewhere with me
15525,Elena," Stefan, I can't"
15526,Stefan," No, no, it's not far, ok? It's just for the day. I promise"
15527,Tyler, What are you doing here?
15528,Jules, I should be asking you that. I told you not to come
15529,Tyler, She's my mother. I had to
15530,Jules, Now we have to get out of here; Lock ourselves up before tonight
15531,Caroline, Tyler? Jules
15532,Jules, I'll give you a few minutes
15533,Tyler, Thank you
15534,Jules," Just a few, Tyler"
15535,Tyler, I got it
15536,Tyler, She's just making sure I'm safe
15537,Caroline," So what, are you two, like, friends now?"
15538,Tyler, She's been helping me. How are you?
15539,Caroline, I heard about your mom. I just came to check in on her
15540,Tyler," She's banged up, but she'll be ok"
15541,Caroline, And you? Um... How's everything with you?
15542,Tyler, I'm hanging in there
15543,Caroline, Good
15544,Tyler, Yeah. I should get going. Jules and I need to get on the road
15545,Caroline, You're leaving again?
15546,Tyler," I left for a reason, Caroline"
15547,Caroline," Your explanation must have got lost in the mail, along with your goodbye"
15548,Tyler, Well... Take care of yourself
15549,Caroline, Tyler...
15550,Greta, Let's go
15551,Matt," Hey, Caroline, it's me. I thought you were coming back to meet me. Look, I need to talk to you. It's important"
15552,Alaric, I'll have the same
15553,Damon, I screwed up
15554,Alaric," Yeah. Yeah, you did"
15555,Klaus, Gentlemen? Why so glum?
15556,Damon," Ugh. Klaus, I presume"
15557,Klaus, In the flesh
15558,Klaus," Thanks for the loaner, mate"
15559,Damon, Any reason you stopped by to say hi?
15560,Klaus, I'm told you and your brother fancies my doppelganger. Just thought I'd remind you to not do anything you'll regret
15561,Damon," Ha. Thanks for your advice. I don't suppose I could talk you into a postponement, by any chance, huh?"
15562,Klaus, You are kidding
15563,Klaus," He is kidding, right?"
15564,Alaric," No, not really"
15565,Damon," I mean, come on, what's one month in the whole grand scheme of things?"
15566,Klaus," Let me be clear... I have my vampire. I have my werewolf. I have everything I need. The ritual will happen tonight. So if you want to live to see tomorrow, don't screw it up"
15567,Damon, That was fun
15568,Alaric," You're getting screwed up, aren't you?"
15569,Damon," You think if I took his werewolf out of the equation, she might... Get over the fact that I tried to turn her into a vampire?"
15570,Alaric," I think it won't matter, because you'll be dead"
15571,Damon," But without the werewolf, he can't perform the ritual tonight, which means I would have bought her one month before the next full moon"
15572,Alaric, But you'll still be dead
15573,Damon, Are you gonna help me or what?
15574,Alaric, What do you want me to do?
15575,Elena, Where are we?
15576,Stefan, It's a surprise. Just a little bit longer
15577,Elena," I'm not a vampire yet, you know. My legs still get tired"
15578,Stefan, Ready to talk about how you're feeling about all this?
15579,Elena," Uh... this morning I was wondering if I would live or die, and now... I'm going to be a vampire. I... I don't really know how I'm feeling"
15580,Elena," My God, this is beautiful"
15581,Stefan, I think you do know how you feel. I just want you to know that it's ok to tell me
15582,Elena," I can't. Stefan, I just... I can't talk about it"
15583,Stefan," Well, if you don't want to, that's your choice. Today's about you. But... It's a long way to the top. Let's go. You never know what might come up"
15584,Elena, We're climbing all the way up to the top?
15585,Stefan," Oh, yeah"
15586,Elena," Well, can't you do one of your super power vampire jumpy things?"
15587,Stefan," No, it's your last day as a human. Why cheat now?"
15588,Katherine, Look who's dumb enough to come back
15589,Alaric," Well, somebody had to invite him in. Damon. Would you like to, uh, come in?"
15590,Katherine, Are you trying to get me k*ll?
15591,Damon," I gave you vervain, now I'm here to collect. I got it from here, Rick"
15592,Alaric, You sure?
15593,Damon," Yeah, only one of us needs to get blamed for this. Get back in the house. Keep Elena from handing herself over"
15594,Alaric, Ok
15595,Katherine, Get blamed for what?
15596,Damon, I need to know where Klaus is keeping his werewolf
15597,Katherine, Why? What are you going to do?
15598,Damon, Dead werewolf equals no ritual
15599,Katherine," No. You can't interfere, Damon. Klaus will k*ll you and everyone you've ever met"
15600,Damon, I just need to delay this thing
15601,Katherine, No. No way
15602,Damon, You should like this. It's going to buy another month of your pathetic life
15603,Katherine, Right. Except that I'm not the vampire he's planning on sacrificing
15604,Damon, What?
15605,Katherine," Yeah. He's got Caroline Forbes and Tyler Lockwood. Therefore, I'm in the clear"
15606,Damon, And where'd he get that idea from?
15607,Katherine," Hey! Hey, hey, hey, I'm just trying to stay alive long enough to get myself out of here"
15608,Damon, What if I told you Elena had vampire bl*od in her system?
15609,Katherine, What?!
15610,Damon," Imagine how much fun that will be competing with Elena for Stefan's love for, I don't know, forever"
15611,Katherine, The tomb. He's got them in the tomb
15612,Damon, Thank you
15613,Caroline, Tyler?
15614,Tyler, You all right?
15615,Caroline, Yeah. I think so
15616,Tyler, I already tried
15617,Caroline, Those witches vervained me
15618,Tyler, Who were they?
15619,Caroline, I think they're with Klaus
15620,Tyler, Who the hell is Klaus?
15621,Caroline, Tyler... You shouldn't have come back here
15622,Elena, I guess Bonnie will have to make me a daylight ring
15623,Stefan," Yeah, piece of cake"
15624,Elena," And I'll never be able to watch ""Bambi"" again"
15625,Stefan, I definitely wouldn't recommend that
15626,Elena, What's the best part about being a vampire?
15627,Stefan," Ahh. You feel like you could do anything. Be anyone. Beautiful things are more beautiful. Everything's heightened, you know, just a little bit more intensely, love more powerfully"
15628,Elena, And the worst?
15629,Stefan," Ah, you know the worst"
15630,Elena, Aside from the bl*od
15631,Stefan," Anger becomes rage. When you're sad, you're in despair. Grief. Loss. It can cripple you. That's why so many of us turn our emotions off. It just becomes... Too overwhelming. You know, for a while, for me, the good just wasn't worth the bad"
15632,Elena, How long before you learned to handle both?
15633,Stefan," Well, I'm still trying. Every day. What else?"
15634,Elena, Let's just keep going. We're not even halfway to the top
15635,Katherine, Everything ok?
15636,Klaus, What have you been doing?
15637,Katherine, Making coffee. Do you want some?
15638,Klaus, Tell me what you've been doing
15639,Katherine, Making coffee
15640,Klaus, Wait. Take off your bracelet. Now
15641,Klaus, I want you... to walk over to the window and stand in the sunlight
15642,Katherine, But I'll burn
15643,Klaus, You don't have a choice
15644,Klaus, That's enough
15645,Klaus," Guess I was wrong. All right, then. I need you to do something for me"
15646,Maddox," Which one are you trying to save? The blond, or the wolf? Did you really think Klaus would leave them unprotected?"
15647,Damon, Wishful thinking
15648,Damon, What are you doing here?
15649,Matt, Where's Caroline?
15650,Damon," Listen, man. Not a good time to play the hero"
15651,Matt, Where is she? And what did he do to her?
15652,Damon, I'm just here to rescue her
15653,Damon, You're lucky I already screwed up once today or you'd be dead
15654,Tyler, The whole Sun and Moon curse is fake?
15655,Caroline," That's what Elena learned. Klaus still needs to do the sacrifice, but it's just not for that"
15656,Tyler, And you think that's why they grabbed us? For the sacrifice
15657,Caroline, Yes
15658,Tyler, He's going to k*ll us?
15659,Caroline, I think so. Yes
15660,Tyler," This whole time I've been gone, Jules has been helping me come to terms with what I am. How to deal with it. Guess none of it matters anymore"
15661,Caroline, Why didn't you say good-bye? You just left
15662,Tyler, You want to talk about this now?
15663,Caroline," Well, if we're going to die, I might as well know the truth. Why did you leave me?"
15664,Tyler, I knew you hated me. I thought you deserved better than having someone like me in your life
15665,Caroline," I was hurt. You know, you turned your back on me when I needed you. But... I could never hate you, Tyler"
15666,Caroline, Damon?
15667,Damon, Your boyfriend's outside with a r*fle loaded with wooden b*ll*ts. You have some explaining to do
15668,Caroline," What, Matt?"
15669,Tyler, Matt knows about you?
15670,Caroline," No, I..."
15671,Damon, Shh. Tomorrow's problem
15672,Damon, Let me just get you out of here
15673,Caroline," Wait, Damon No! I'm not leaving without him"
15674,Damon, Ohhh. It's getting dark soon
15675,Damon, How fast can you get the hell away from here?
15676,Tyler, I need to get to my family's cellar. I can lock myself up
15677,Caroline, I'll help
15678,Damon, Don't make me regret this
15679,Elena, We made it! Ahh
15680,Stefan," That's nothing, if you've climbed Mt. Everest"
15681,Elena," Nobody likes a bragger, Stefan"
15682,Elena," Oh, wow"
15683,Stefan," Yeah. Hey, you can say it"
15684,Elena, Say what?
15685,Stefan," The thing you've been wanting to say, but... Been afraid of how it'll make me feel"
15686,Elena," There's nothing I can say, Stefan. It's not going to change anything"
15687,Stefan," Might make you feel better. Look, I know this isn't the first time you've thought about it. Drinking vampire bl*od to survive. I mean, I know I've thought about it a hundred times"
15688,Elena," And before all this with Klaus, did you think about it then?"
15689,Stefan," Of course I did. Elena... If it were my choice, I'd want to be with you forever"
15690,Elena, Why have you never brought it up?
15691,Stefan," 'Cause I knew if it was an option, you would have. It would be selfish for me to ask you"
15692,Elena, Didn't stop Damon
15693,Stefan, He shouldn't have done what he did. He did it because he loves you
15694,Elena," But he did this to me, Stefan, which means he doesn't really know what love is. And to be honest, I don't know if I do. I'm 17 years old. How am I supposed to know any of this yet?"
15695,Elena," I know that I love you, Stefan. I know that. But my future? Our lives together? Those were things I was supposed to deal with as they came along. I was supposed to grow up"
15696,Elena," Decide if I want to have kids and start a family. Grow old. I was supposed to have a lifetime of those choices, and... now? That's all gone"
15697,Stefan," There, say it"
15698,Elena," I don't want to be a vampire, Stefan. I never wanted to be one"
15699,Stefan, I know
15700,Caroline," Hey, Matt!"
15701,Caroline, Hey. Did you hit him?!
15702,Damon, Did you already forget the part about the g*n with the wooden b*ll*ts?
15703,Caroline, Tyler? Tyler?
15704,Tyler, It's starting
15705,Damon, Grab boy wonder and let's go
15706,Caroline, Come on
15707,Elena, Thanks for today
15708,Klaus," You got me all nervous. I thought maybe you'd done something stupid. You ready, my dear?"
15709,Elena, I'm ready
15710,Stefan, No
15711,Klaus," I wouldn't. No reason for you to die, too"
15712,Elena," Stefan, hey, hey, it's fine, it's fine. I'll go. No one needs to get hurt. There's no reason for you to get hurt"
15713,Elena, I love you
15714,Stefan, I love you
15715,Elena, Close your eyes. Close your eyes
15716,Alaric," There you are. I got here, the house was empty"
15717,Stefan, Where's Damon?
15718,Matt, What's happening? Is he ok?
15719,Damon, He better not wolf out on us
15720,Damon," Bad time, little bro"
15721,Stefan, What the hell are you doing?
15722,Damon, Saving the day. I figured you'd understand. Just tell Elena to stay put
15723,Stefan," She's already gone, Damon"
15724,Damon, What?
15725,Stefan, Klaus came. He took her 
15726,Damon, I'll take care of it
15727,Matt, Tyler!
15728,Tyler, I don't know if I can hold it off. Get out of here
15729,Caroline," Tyler, it'll be ok"
15730,Tyler, Go!
15731,Caroline," You've got time. We're almost there, just..."
15732,Tyler, It's happening faster
15733,Caroline," Tyler, it's ok"
15734,Caroline, Damon...
15735,Damon, I'm fine.
15736,Tyler, Get out of here!
15737,Damon," Get to the Lockwood cellar. If it held him in, it'll keep him out. If it doesn't... Use these"
15738,Damon, It'll buy you a couple seconds. Go. Go!
15739,Klaus, Where's Maddox? He should be back by now
15740,Katherine, I don't know
15741,Katherine, What are you doing? Where's Elena?
15742,Klaus, I sent her off with Greta
15743,Klaus, It's almost time
15744,Klaus, I wasn't aware you'd been invited in
15745,Damon, I've come here to tell you that you have to postpone the ritual
15746,Klaus, Didn't we already have this conversation?
15747,Damon," Yeah, but that was before I rescued your werewolf, and vampire and k*ll your witch"
15748,Klaus, Excuse me?
15749,Damon, And you can k*ll me for it. I don't care. It was all me
15750,Klaus," Katerina, give us a moment"
15751,Klaus," I've heard about you. The crazy, impulsive vampire in love with his brother's girl. I knew one of you would try to stop me. It was a just a 50/50 guess on who"
15752,Klaus, The nice thing about werewolves is they tend to travel in packs. Need a closer look?
15753,Damon, Jules
15754,Klaus, When you spend a thousand years trying to break a curse... You learn a thing or two. First rule... always have a back-up. Back-up werewolf. Back-up witch
15755,Damon, Back-up vampire
15756,Klaus," I've got that covered, too"
15757,Caroline," Come on, down here"
15758,Matt, Is that going to hold?
15759,Caroline, No
15760,Caroline, Help me with the gate. Help me with the gate
15761,Caroline, Tyler? It's me. It's Caroline. Tyler?
15762,Katherine, Hey. Damon. Hey. Damon
15763,Damon, Ahh. What the hell happened?
15764,Katherine, He's gone. He went to do the ritual. I'm sorry. I had to. He would have known that I was on vervain if I didn't do it
15765,Damon, Ahh. Do what?
15766,Katherine, Klaus. He made me call her to lure her out. He needed another vampire
15767,Damon," Who did you call? Who did you call, Katherine?"
15768,Elena, Where are we going?
15769,Greta, This way
15770,Elena," You're Luka's sister, aren't you? I heard about you. He and your father were looking for you"
15771,Greta," Well, they were wasting their time. I wasn't lost"
15772,Elena," God, I can't see anything"
15773,Elena," Jenna? Jenna, Jenna! Jenna? Hey, hey, Jenna! Jenna!"
15774,Elena," Oh, my God. No. Jenna! No!"
15775,Elena, He k*ll her? Why? I did everything that he asked
15776,Greta, She's not dead. She's in transition
15777,Damon, Should have used me. Why didn't he use me?
15778,Katherine," He couldn't. Damon, he said you were as good as dead"
15779,Damon, What does that even mean?
15780,Katherine, What does that mean?
15781,Katherine," What is this, Damon?"
15782,Damon, It's a werewolf bite
15783,Matt," Caroline, let me help!"
15784,Caroline," Get back, I got it!"
15785,Matt," Caroline, the door's not going to hold"
15786,Caroline," Come on! Tyler, please!"
15787,Caroline," Matt! No, hey, no! It's Tyler!"
15788,Matt, He's trying to k*ll us!
15789,Caroline, Wait!
15790,Caroline, He's wounded
15791,Matt," Caroline, stay back"
15792,Caroline, We can go around him
15793,Matt, Are you nuts?
15794,Caroline," You're not going to sh**t him again, ok? Matt, take my hand"
15795,Matt, I got it
15796,Caroline," Matt, take my hand"
15797,Katherine, So that's what a werewolf bite looks like
15798,Damon, Yep
15799,Katherine, It's not that bad
15800,Damon, Will be
15801,Katherine, So that's it? You're just... Going to die?
15802,Damon," Well, that depends. You know anything about a cure?"
15803,Damon," Me, either"
15804,Katherine, 145 years and no last good-bye?
15805,Damon, You don't get a good-bye
15806,Katherine, No. Don't leave mad
15807,Damon," Us ending on up on good terms isn't exactly on my bucket list, Katherine"
15808,Katherine, Klaus made me call Jenna to lure her out. There was nothing that I could do. I didn't have a choice
15809,Damon, That's why I gave you the vervain. So you had a choice
15810,Katherine, It was her or me. I chose her
15811,Damon," I helped you. You owed me. Now when Klaus dies, you're going to walk out of here without a scratch"
15812,Katherine, I didn't let love get in the way
15813,Damon," Enjoy eternity alone, Katherine"
15814,Katherine, What are you going to do?
15815,Damon, I'm going to offer myself as a replacement to Klaus
15816,Katherine," He won't take you. He saw your bite; he said that your bl*od is impure. I'm sorry, Damon. But Jenna's dead, there's nothing you can do about it"
15817,Jenna," oh, my head. What's wrong with me?"
15818,Elena, Do you remember what happened?
15819,Jenna," You called me. You were so scared. Oh, ah, I should have realized that it wasn't you. The second I walked out of the house, someone grabbed me. A vampire"
15820,Elena, Klaus. It was Klaus
15821,Jenna, He made me drink his bl*od. And I don't... I don't remember anything after that
15822,Jenna, Where are we? What happened?
15823,Elena, We're at the quarry. He brought us here
15824,Jenna, Why don't I remember anything?
15825,Elena," Jenna, do you remember... When I told you how someone becomes a vampire?"
15826,Jenna," Yeah, if you die with vampire bl*od in your system, it's... Oh, god. He k*ll me"
15827,Elena," Jenna, listen to me. Listen to me; everything's going to be ok. I'm going to get you out of here"
15828,Jenna, I'm a vampire?
15829,Greta, And I bet you're hungry
15830,Greta, Don't bother trying to get through. I spelled the circle. You're trapped. No matter what you do
15831,Elena," Greta... Please, just- just let her go"
15832,Greta, Klaus chose her
15833,Greta, Drink it
15834,Elena," Jenna, don't!"
15835,Jenna, I can't
15836,Elena, Let her go. Hey!
15837,Elena, No!
15838,Greta, That's enough
15839,Elena, It's going to be ok
15840,Elena," Look at me. Hey, look at me"
15841,Elena, It's gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok
15842,Jeremy, this is useless. All these grimoires. There has to be something in here to keep Elena from becoming a vampire
15843,Bonnie, And we'll keep looking. Until the last minute
15844,Elijah," The sacrifice is completed in stages as the full moon sets. First the werewolf is k*ll, then the vampire. Finally the doppelganger. Once Elena dies, the curse will be broken. Klaus will become hybrid"
15845,Alaric, So when do we attack?
15846,Elijah, Elena's death will activate his dormant werewolf side. He'll be vulnerable during the transformation. That's when bonnie comes in
15847,Stefan, And you're sure bonnie will survive this?
15848,Elijah," If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job myself"
15849,Stefan, Damon
15850,Damon, You're not going to like what I'm about to say
15851,Stefan, Cut to the chase. Is the sacrifice happening or not?
15852,Damon," It's happening. I tried to stop it, but it got... Complicated"
15853,Stefan, We're sticking with the original plan. We're meeting bonnie right now
15854,Damon," He's got Jenna, Stefan"
15855,Stefan, What?
15856,Damon, He got Katherine to lure her out of the house
15857,Alaric, What is it? What's wrong?
15858,Damon, He's going to use her as the vampire in the ritual
15859,Stefan," Oh, my god"
15860,Elena, How are you feeling?
15861,Jenna," I feel like myself... Only not. Everything is brighter. The fire's hotter. Part of me is terrified, but there's another part of me that doesn't want to feel anything"
15862,Elena, Vampires can turn off the part that's human. That's the part that hurts
15863,Jenna," I'm gonna die, aren't I?"
15864,Elena," No! Jenna, I'm not going to let that happen. I don't care what I have to do"
15865,Jenna, Who's that?
15866,Elena, That must be the werewolf
15867,Jules, What's happening to me?
15868,Greta, I cast a spell to slow down your transformation. Your insides are trying to tear themselves free
15869,Elena," Greta, witches are supposed to maintain the balance in nature. It's your duty to them to keep this curse sealed"
15870,Greta, My duty is to Klaus! The new order
15871,Klaus, Glad to know I still have a dance partner
15872,Klaus," Hello, my lovelies. Are we ready?"
15873,Caroline, Do you see anything?
15874,Matt," We're not safe here. If that thing wants in, it's getting in"
15875,Caroline, How did you even know what I was? I compelled you to forget!
15876,Matt, I was on vervain. I faked forgetting so I could spy on you. It was your mom's idea
15877,Caroline," Wait, my mom knows?! You told her. Well, what'd she say?"
15878,Matt, Your mom hates vampires. She grew up hating vampires. She'll probably always hate vampires
15879,Caroline," Well, what about you?"
15880,Matt, What about me?
15881,Caroline, Where does this leave us?
15882,Matt, Stuck in this house. Trying not to get mauled to death by our friend
15883,Damon, heard ya
15884,Damon, Great. I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat
15885,John, Elena hasn't returned any of my calls for days. I need to see her
15886,Damon," Well, you're a day late and a daughter short, John"
15887,John, What are you talking about?
15888,Damon, Klaus has her. Sacrifice goes down tonight
15889,John, How could you let that happen? You were supposed to keep her safe. Wasn't that the sum total of your plan; to keep her safe?
15890,Damon, She is safe. I fed her my bl*od
15891,John, You what?!
15892,Damon," When Klaus k*ll Elena in the sacrifice, she will come back to life. Granted, as the thing you hate most in the world, but no one really cares what you think"
15893,Damon, You do not want to mess with me right now
15894,John," You ruined her life. You know that, right?"
15895,Damon," I know, john. I took her choice, destroyed her future. Trust me, I get it. It actually gets worse"
15896,John, How could it possibly get any worse?
15897,Klaus, I spent 500 years looking for this. I hate to part with it
15898,Greta, The moon has passed its apex. Remember everything you need to do?
15899,Klaus, I remember
15900,Jules, Everything I did... I was just trying to help Tyler
15901,Elena, Are you Jules?
15902,Jules, I didn't want him to be alone!
15903,Klaus, Shall we?
15904,Bonnie, Which one are you reading? 
15905,Jeremy, Emily Bennett's has a section on spells she did for my ancestor Jonathan Gilbert
15906,Bonnie," Yeah, I think she had a thing for him"
15907,Jeremy, There's something on a resuscitative spell she was working on
15908,Bonnie," I saw that, too. She just didn't explain what it did, exactly"
15909,Jeremy," Maybe Jonathan wrote about it in his journals. You know, I can have Stefan bring them"
15910,Bonnie, someone's here
15911,Jeremy," Hey, what are you doing here?"
15912,Alaric, Elijah and Stefan are upstairs
15913,Alaric, You mind if I have a second with Jeremy?
15914,Bonnie," Sure, yeah. Of course"
15915,Jeremy, What's the matter?
15916,Alaric, Jeremy... Something's happened to Jenna
15917,Bonnie, Why did he take Jenna?
15918,Elijah, A punishment for meddling
15919,Stefan, Klaus was going to use Tyler and Caroline but Damon rescued them
15920,Bonnie, Then we need to go. Now. Before Jenna's been sacrificed. I can k*ll Klaus myself
15921,Stefan," Bonnie... If you use that much power, you'll be dead. We've already been through this. It's not an option"
15922,Bonnie, Neither is letting Jenna die
15923,Elijah," Well, Stefan would agree with you"
15924,Stefan, We're going to offer another vampire. One that he'll want more. Me
15925,Klaus, Tell me it's working
15926,Greta, It's working
15927,Jenna," The day that the lawyers called to tell me that I was going to become your guardian, you know what my first thought was? Isn't there someone else who can do this?"
15928,Elena," Jenna, there was no one else who could have gotten me and Jeremy through all of that"
15929,Jenna, It's just the thought that I almost passed up taking care of you
15930,Elena, But you didn't. You put your entire life on hold to help us
15931,Jenna," Look around, Elena. I failed you"
15932,Elena," You didn't. I failed you. I'm so sorry. Listen. Being a vampire, it intensifies your guilt. But it also makes you stronger and faster. You can fight back. I'm gonna get through this. I'll be ok. I need you to believe that. Promise me, when you get the chance... Run"
15933,Matt," You don't think I k*ll him, do you?"
15934,Caroline, No. No. It takes a lot more than wooden b*ll*ts To k*ll a werewolf. He's still out there somewhere. Do you think my mom wants to k*ll me?
15935,Matt, I don't think your mom knows what to do with you
15936,Caroline," Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do with me, either"
15937,Matt, what is it?
15938,Caroline, Wait. Don't. Don't sh**t
15939,Matt, What the hell are you doing?
15940,Caroline, Give me your jacket
15941,Matt, What?
15942,Caroline," Your jacket, take it off"
15943,Tyler, Caroline?
15944,Elijah, Bonnie did a locator spell. They're at Steven's quarry
15945,Stefan, I'll head over there first and you'll follow with bonnie when it's time
15946,Elijah, Just as the moon hits its final phase. She's to stay hidden until then. He cannot know that she's alive
15947,Elijah, You're very honorable
15948,Stefan," Are you? Because this whole plan is, um, it's contingent upon your honor, Elijah"
15949,Elijah, I won't fail you
15950,Stefan, Klaus is your brother. I know I've wanted to k*ll my brother a thousand times. I've never been able to
15951,Elijah," Well, Klaus was not my only brother. I had siblings; Parents. I had a family. Over the centuries, Klaus hunted them down one by one and he took them from me. He scattered them across the seas where their bodies couldn't be found"
15952,Stefan, You want revenge
15953,Elijah," Sometimes there's honor in revenge, Stefan. I won't fail you"
15954,Stefan, Please end this
15955,John, I brought the Gilbert journals. I think I know the spell you're talking about
15956,Bonnie, Where's Damon?
15957,John, Upstairs. Alaric wanted to talk to him
15958,Damon, He did what?!
15959,Alaric, He wasn't going to let Jenna die
15960,Damon, We have a witch. She k*ll Klaus. No one has to die!
15961,Alaric, Except for Bonnie 
15962,Damon," God, Stefan, damn it!"
15963,Alaric," Hey, are you ok?"
15964,Damon," I'm fine. Well, that's my brother for you. Always cleaning up my messes"
15965,Klaus," Hello, Jenna"
15966,Elena," Let her go. I understand that I have to die, but she doesn't!"
15967,Klaus, Careful
15968,Jenna," Elena, don't"
15969,Elena," No, Jenna! We can't leave Jeremy without a family"
15970,Elena, I followed your rules; I did everything that you asked. I didn't run. Please
15971,Klaus," Well, well"
15972,Klaus, I don't recall you being on the guest list
15973,Stefan, I'm here to talk
15974,Klaus," Very well, then"
15975,Klaus," What can I do for you, Mr. Salvatore?"
15976,Bonnie, We found something in the Gilbert journals
15977,John, Jonathan journaled the story of a mother who called on Emily's services. The woman's baby was sick; dying. Emily cast a spell that would bind a woman's life force with her child
15978,Damon, Skip to the save Elena part
15979,John," Well, the child died, but the mother's life force flowed through her, restoring her to life"
15980,Jeremy, We already know Elena's going to come back to life but she'll be a vampire
15981,John, Not if her soul remains intact
15982,Damon," Her soul, really? You're going to put your faith in some act of god mumbo jumbo?"
15983,John," I refuse to let Elena become the thing I've spent my life protecting her against. And you can call that god or mystical energy, whatever you want, but yes... I'm putting my faith in it"
15984,Jenna, What's going on?
15985,Elena, I-I don't know. You can hear them. Your senses are heightened. You can hear anything. Just focus on them
15986,Stefan, You don't need to k*ll Jenna. I'll take her place
15987,Klaus," Oh, I don't know. I rather appreciate the symmetry of three women- Three goddesses- Sacrificed at nature's altar"
15988,Elena, What are they saying?
15989,Jenna, I can't-I can't make it out
15990,Elena, You can do this. Just relax. Focus
15991,Stefan, Don't play games with me. You'll get what you want
15992,Klaus," You're quite the hero, aren't you? I've heard that about you"
15993,Stefan, Just make the trade. Me for Jenna
15994,Jenna," Oh, my god"
15995,Elena, What is it?
15996,Jenna, He wants to take my place
15997,Matt, How's Tyler doing?
15998,Caroline, Sleeping. He should better by morning. He just... He needs some rest
15999,Matt," Good. So this is your life now, huh?"
16000,Caroline, Never a dull moment
16001,Matt," You know, these last few days with you have been so great, and fun and so Caroline"
16002,Matt, I-I thought that I might be able to get past this whole vampire thing
16003,Caroline, But you can. Matt...
16004,Matt," I don't know if I can, Caroline"
16005,Caroline, Matt!
16006,Matt," I get it. This is your life now. You know what my life is, car? My life is an absentee mom. And a bunch of bills to pay, and school, and a job, and it sucks sometimes. But it's my life. and... I think that I just want to live it without all of this"
16007,Damon," Come on, bonnie, we got a hybrid to k*ll"
16008,Bonnie, It's done
16009,Damon, That's it? Let's go
16010,Bonnie, I'll be back soon
16011,Jeremy," Wait, what do you mean? No, I'm coming. I need to be there. I need to make sure you guys are ok"
16012,Bonnie, And who's going to make sure you're ok?
16013,Jeremy," I've got my own ring. Look, I'm not taking no for an answer"
16014,John, Just go. I'll stay with him
16015,Elijah, It's time
16016,Alaric, All right. I got the w*apon in the car
16017,Elijah, Bonnie's the only w*apon we need
16018,Alaric, Bonnie! What is this?
16019,Bonnie, I can't put anyone else at risk
16020,Alaric, I can't stay here with Jenna out there!
16021,Bonnie, I'm sorry
16022,Alaric, You can't do this! Damon?
16023,Damon," Sorry, buddy. She's right"
16024,Alaric, No! You can't do this
16025,Alaric, Bonnie! Bonnie!
16026,Jenna, Elena...
16027,Elena, I have to do something. This can't happen. None of it
16028,Klaus," Quite the predicament. You know, it's funny, All this talk about preserving family, and here's Stefan, Granting your wish"
16029,Elena, Stefan…
16030,Stefan, It's okay
16031,Klaus," Well. Who's it going to be, Elena?"
16032,Elena, No
16033,Klaus," Oh, don't worry. There's actually no choice"
16034,Elena, No! Stefan! No!
16035,Klaus, I have other plans for your boyfriend. I want him alive. But for now...
16036,Klaus," Whenever you're ready, Greta"
16037,Klaus, Your turn
16038,Elena," No, Jenna, no!"
16039,Jenna," It's alright, Elena. I know what I have to do"
16040,Elena, Just turn it off. Jenna. Turn it off. You won't be scared anymore
16041,Elena, No! Jenna! No! Jenna! No
16042,Stefan, I'm so sorry
16043,Elena, Are they going to k*ll him?
16044,Klaus, It's time
16045,Klaus," Thank you, Elena"
16046,Elena, Go to hell 
16047,Klaus," I can feel it. It's happening. Yes, yes!"
16048,Klaus, You were dead!
16049,Stefan, Elena
16050,Stefan, I need you to get her out of here!
16051,Damon, What about you?
16052,Stefan, I'm not leaving until he's dead. Go!
16053,Klaus, Elijah?
16054,Elijah," Hello, brother"
16055,Elijah," In the name of our family, Nicklaus..."
16056,Klaus," I didn't bury them at sea! Their bodies are safe. If you k*ll me, you'll never find them"
16057,Stefan, Elijah! Don't listen to him
16058,Klaus, I can take you to them. I give you my word... Brother
16059,Bonnie, Do it or I'll take you both out
16060,Elijah, You'll die
16061,Bonnie, I don't care
16062,Elijah, I'm sorry
16063,Alaric, we should have heard from them by now
16064,Jeremy, Did you read all this?
16065,John, I did
16066,Jeremy, So you understand what happened to the child's mother after the baby was brought back to life
16067,John, She saved her daughter. She found peace
16068,Jeremy, John...
16069,John, I need you to give this to Elena for me and also this
16070,Alaric," Oh, hey, what's going on?"
16071,John, Take care of each other. Please
16072,Alaric, I think they're here!
16073,Damon," If you come back as a vampire, I'll stake you myself. So don't"
16074,Damon, Because I can't stand the idea of you hating me forever
16075,Jeremy, How is she?
16076,Damon, I don't know yet
16077,Alaric, What about Jenna?
16078,Alaric, No
16079,Damon," I'm sorry, Jeremy"
16080,Damon, Elena!
16081,Elena, What happened?
16082,Damon, How do you feel?
16083,Elena, I feel fine
16084,Caroline," Ooh, yeah, you got sh*t but it's healing"
16085,Tyler, You were right. I shouldn't have come home
16086,Caroline," No, you just... Should have never left. And you shouldn't leave again"
16087,Tyler," You're kidding, right? This is the second time I've tried to k*ll you"
16088,Caroline," Well, no friendship is perfect. Matt broke up with me"
16089,Tyler, I'm sorry
16090,Caroline," Yeah, well, you know, instead of just bailing on me again, you could just say... ""Thank you, Caroline, for taking care of me. And I'm sorry that I tried to chow down on you again. """
16091,Tyler, Hey. Hey. Come here
16092,Tyler," Thank you, Caroline. For taking care of me"
16093,Caroline, You're welcome
16094,Stefan, We all set?
16095,Damon," Yeah. Plenty of room with the gilbert family plot, and I compelled two of the grave diggers to do the dirty work. How's she doing?"
16096,Stefan, She lost the only parents she had. She's in shock
16097,Elena, I'm almost ready
16098,Jeremy, Take your time
16099,Jeremy, John wanted me to give you this. And this
16100,Elena, Jeremy... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that you've lost so many people
16101,Jeremy, I still have you
16102,John," ""Elena... it's no easy task being an ordinary parent to an extraordinary child. I failed in that task."""
16103,John," ""And because of my prejudices, I failed you. I'm haunted by how things might have played out differently. If I'd been more willing to hear your side of things."" "
16104,John," ""for me, it's the end. For you, a chance to grow old and someday do better with your own child than I did with mine. It's for that child that I give you my ring."""
16105,John," """"I don't ask for your forgiveness or for you to forget. I ask only that you believe this. Whether you are now reading this as a human or as a vampire, I love you all the same as I've always loved you, and always will. John. """
16106,Stefan, We're going to head back to the house
16107,Damon, I think I'll skip the coffee and tea cakes
16108,Stefan," Damon, she needs us right now. All of us"
16109,Damon," And then what's the plan, Stefan? The curse is broken. How does one go about k*ll an all-powerful wolf vamp and his two-faced older brother?"
16110,Stefan, I have no idea
16111,Damon, You need to get an idea. Fast
16112,Stefan, We will. I'm not going to let Elena lose anybody else
16113,Damon," I wouldn't make any promises, brother"
16114,Stefan, What's that supposed to mean?
16115,Damon," Tyler Lockwood bit me. It's actually more of a nip, really, but there it is"
16116,Stefan, We'll find something. A cure
16117,Damon," There's no cure, Stefan"
16118,Stefan," We kept Elena human, right? We found the way when there was no way. Hey. I will do this"
16119,Damon, You want to do something for me? Keep this from Elena. Last thing she needs is another grave to mourn
16120,Damon, That'll get easier. But you knew that
16121,Elena, What do you want?
16122,Damon, I want to apologize
16123,Elena, Damon…
16124,Damon," Please. Elena, feeding you my bl*od, I was wrong"
16125,Elena," Yes, you were"
16126,Damon," And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, but... I need it"
16127,Elena," And I need some time, maybe a lot of time"
16128,Damon, Sure. True. Of course
16129,Damon, Get off of me
16130,Stefan, You're not doing this
16131,Damon," Just did. You know what happened to Rose, Stefan"
16132,Stefan, I don't care. You're not dying today
16133,Damon," What's the plan, Superman?"
16134,Stefan, I'm gonna find a way out of this
16135,Damon," Oh, right. A miracle cure. Good luck with that one"
16136,Stefan," I got Bonnie looking for something, anything"
16137,Damon," Always the hero, Stefan. Just tell me good-bye, get it over with"
16138,Stefan, Lie still. Conserve your strength
16139,Elijah, You've been busy
16140,Klaus, That was amazing. How long has it been?
16141,Elijah, Almost 2 days. Full moon came and went. You remained a wolf
16142,Klaus," I can change at will, then. It's good to know. I remember every single k*ll"
16143,Elijah," Yes, I've been cleaning up your little mess along the way"
16144,Klaus," Just like old times, brother"
16145,Elijah, You've had your fun. I believe we have a bargain
16146,Klaus," That's right. Now, what was it again? Oh, yeah. Wait. I remember. That's it. You wish to be reunited with our family"
16147,Elijah," You gave me your word, Nicklaus"
16148,Klaus, What kind of brother would break his bond? Even though you did try to k*ll me
16149,Elijah, I could have. But I didn't
16150,Klaus," And now no one can, not even you. Relax, Elijah. All is forgiven"
16151,Elijah, Where are they?
16152,Klaus, You need to lighten up. I'll bring you to them soon enough
16153,Alaric," Sorry, you've reached somebody who's currently not operating"
16154,Stefan, I need your help
16155,Alaric," Well, you must have me confused with somebody else. You see, I'm not allowed to help, just idly sit by while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of bl*od"
16156,Stefan, Damon's dying
16157,Alaric, What?
16158,Stefan, Tyler Lockwood bit him. We don't have much time 
16159,Alaric, What do you need?
16160,Jeremy, You brought me to see a girl movie
16161,Elena," We had to get out of the house, Jer. This is our 3-hour distraction from reality"
16162,Jeremy, Is that what we're doing? Pretending like our lives aren't screwed?
16163,Elena," We need to do this, ok? Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up, and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore"
16164,Caroline, Hey! There you guys are. Who's hungry?
16165,Jeremy, Are we really doing this?
16166,Caroline," Yes, we are really doing this. We are going to take a page from Scarlett. We made it through the w*r. I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire, so basically it's like Atlanta has b*rned. And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere"
16167,Jeremy, All right
16168,Jeremy, What are we eating?
16169,Caroline, Something good
16170,Bonnie, I'm not sure this is going to work
16171,Stefan," You've done a séance before, right? Contacted Emily Bennett. Maybe one of the witches might know how to help Damon"
16172,Bonnie, Let's just hope they want to
16173,Stefan, Bonnie? Bonnie?
16174,Bonnie, Emily
16175,Bonnie/Emily," Why have you come here, Stefan?"
16176,Stefan, I need your help. I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite
16177,Bonnie/Emily, No. Nature ensures a balance to everything
16178,Stefan, Is that true... or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
16179,Bonnie/Emily, Perhaps it is his time to die
16180,Stefan, No. That's not balance. That's punishment
16181,Bonnie/Emily, I will not give you what you want
16182,Stefan," So you're saying that there's an answer to give? Please, if you know something, just tell me. Help me save my brother"
16183,Stefan, Bonnie
16184,Bonnie, They don't want us here. They think I'm abusing their power
16185,Stefan, They know something. There's an answer. They just don't want to tell me
16186,Bonnie, Yeah. I heard them say a name
16187,Stefan, What was it?
16188,Bonnie, Klaus
16189,Sheriff Forbes, Carol. Hi. How you feeling?
16190,Carol," Better, thank goodness"
16191,Sheriff Forbes, That was a terrible fall. Shouldn't you be home resting?
16192,Carol," I've been resting, and now I'm ready to get back to work. I need you to update me on where we are with the vampire situation"
16193,Sheriff Forbes," Well, there have been some developments, but I'm handling it"
16194,Carol," Are you? Because I left you in charge of this town's safety, and lately I'm not seeing any results"
16195,Sheriff Forbes, I said I'm handling it
16196,Carol," Then see that you do, Sheriff, because if you can't, I'll find someone who will"
16197,Elena, Look who couldn't resist an epic romance
16198,Stefan, Will you come take a walk with me?
16199,Elena," You're breaking the rules, you know. Movie night's supposed to be a distraction. Tomorrow we can return to our regularly scheduled drama"
16200,Stefan," I know. I wish this could wait, but it can't. Listen, um, the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened. Tyler was starting to transform, and Damon was bitten"
16201,Elena, What? Is it... is he gonna...
16202,Stefan, Yeah
16203,Elena," Oh, my God. And he came to the house this morning and... and tried to apologize. I practically slammed the door in his face"
16204,Stefan," He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him, I... I wouldn't wait"
16205,Elena, Stefan…
16206,Stefan," it's not over. There might be a cure, but I have to find Klaus to get it"
16207,Elena, No. He's gonna k*ll you
16208,Stefan," No, he had the chance to k*ll me, but he didn't. Whatever Damon's done, whatever has led him here, I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place, so if there's a chance for a cure, I owe it to him to find it"
16209,Stefan, Go talk to him. Just tell him that there's still hope
16210,Katherine," Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners"
16211,Damon, My apologies miss Katherine
16212,Katherine," But since you are here, my corset strings seem to be knotted. I wonder if you can undo them"
16213,Damon, Of course
16214,Katherine, Will you miss me while off defending the South?
16215,Damon, I shall
16216,Katherine, Then I hope you will hurry back. I fear I will be lonely with you away
16217,Damon, I would think Stefan should be company enough
16218,Katherine, Is it so wrong for me to want you both?
16219,Elena, Damon
16220,Damon, Elena?
16221,Elena," Don't you see? She was toying with you. All you had to do was say no, walk away. You had a choice"
16222,Katherine, Promise me that you will return quickly
16223,Damon, I promise
16224,Stefan," Hello, Katherine"
16225,Katherine," Two days, I've been waiting. I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now. He's supposed to be dead"
16226,Stefan, We ran into complications
16227,Katherine, Complications?
16228,Stefan, Doesn't really matter. I just need to find him. Do you have any idea where he might be?
16229,Katherine," Klaus, you're back. Look who decided to come for a visit"
16230,Klaus," You just keep popping up, don't you?"
16231,Stefan, I need your help... For my brother
16232,Klaus," Well, whatever it is, he's gonna have to wait a tick. You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention"
16233,Elijah," You understand how important family is, or you wouldn't be here. My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own"
16234,Klaus, And so I shall
16235,Klaus," Now, what am I gonna do with you?"
16236,Klaus, Do you feel that? It's scraping against your heart. The slightest little movement and you're dead
16237,Katherine, He's just trying to help his brother
16238,Stefan," The witches said you had a cure. Make me a deal. Just give me the cure, and I'll do whatever you want"
16239,Klaus, Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now. You are just shy of useless
16240,Alaric," Well, that looks bad"
16241,Damon," It feels worse. My subconscious is haunting me, Rick. Please tell me you have something for that"
16242,Alaric, Double sh*t
16243,Damon, That's good
16244,Damon, Oh good
16245,Damon, So my brother sent you for su1c1de watch?
16246,Alaric, He's just trying to help
16247,Damon," He's doing what he always does, trying to right the wrongs of the past"
16248,Damon, You should want me dead. I'm the reason Jenna got k*ll
16249,Alaric, I don't blame you for Jenna
16250,Damon," Oh, sure you do. Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire. You must really hate me for that one"
16251,Alaric," Ok, give me your glass. Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation"
16252,Damon, k*ll me. Please
16253,Alaric, Screw you
16254,Damon, No. Elena?
16255,Alaric," Elena's not here, Damon"
16256,Sheriff Forbes, Don't make a sound
16257,Damon, I need bl*od. I need bl*od
16258,Sheriff Forbes, Where's Damon?
16259,Alaric," You know, now's not a good time, Sheriff. Trust me"
16260,Deputy," Sheriff, over here"
16261,Alaric, I wouldn't go in there
16262,Sheriff Forbes, I just wanna talk to him
16263,Alaric, I wouldn't go in there
16264,Damon, Liz
16265,Caroline, All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me
16266,Jeremy, Alaric. Hey
16267,Alaric, Tell me you're with Elena
16268,Jeremy, She went to go see Damon. I thought that's where you were
16269,Alaric," No, he just escaped. I think he's looking for her, and the cops are after him. Listen, he's in bad shape, Jeremy, so if you find her, get her somewhere safe, ok? I'm on my way"
16270,Bonnie," If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him. Let us take care of it"
16271,Jeremy," You keep doing this. You left me behind before, and guess what. Jenna still died. Now I'm going to find my sister. You go ahead and you try to stop me"
16272,Klaus," I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke, always on and off the wagon for decades. When he was off, he was magnificent. 1917, he went into Monterey and wiped out an entire migrant village... A true ripper. Sound familiar?"
16273,Stefan, I haven't been that way in a very long time
16274,Klaus," Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with. That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town"
16275,Klaus," Katerina, come here"
16276,Katherine, Aah! Aah! No. No... No. No. No
16277,Klaus, You want your cure? There it is
16278,Stefan, Your bl*od is the cure
16279,Klaus, Gotta love Mother Nature
16280,Klaus," Now... Let's talk, you and I"
16281,Damon, Katherine
16282,Jeremy, Damon
16283,Damon, Where's Elena? I need to see Elena now
16284,Jeremy," Ok. Let's get you out of here first, all right?"
16285,Elena, Where's Damon? What did you do to him?
16286,Sheriff Forbes," Why do you even care? You know what they are, what they do"
16287,Elena," Look, I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong"
16288,Sheriff Forbes," They're m*rder, Elena. End of story"
16289,Deputy, Damon Salvatore was just spotted outside entering The Grill
16290,Elena, Wait. You've gotta let me come with you. He's sick. He's... he's not himself
16291,Sheriff Forbes, Keep her here
16292,Jeremy," Hey, it's me. I'm with Damon at The Grill"
16293,Sheriff Forbes," Oh, God. Oh, God"
16294,Sheriff Forbes, I've got a g*n v*ctim at The Grill. Get the paramedics here
16295,Sheriff Forbes, You're gonna be fine. It's gonna be ok
16296,Bonnie, Jeremy!
16297,Caroline," Mom. Mom, what did you do?"
16298,Sheriff Forbes, I was aiming for Damon
16299,Caroline, He still has his ring
16300,Bonnie, She's human. The ring won't work on him. Caroline…
16301,Caroline, I got it
16302,Caroline," Come on, Jeremy. Just drink. Go on, Jeremy. Drink"
16303,Sheriff Forbes, What are you doing?
16304,Caroline," I'm helping him. Jeremy, drink. Please. Please. Please"
16305,Alaric," Bonnie, what's going on?"
16306,Alaric," Oh, my God"
16307,Bonnie, I know what I need to do
16308,Bonnie, I need you to grab him. T-take him with us
16309,Sheriff Forbes," No, no, no, no. You can't move him. This is a crime scene"
16310,Caroline," Mom, you let them go"
16311,Alaric," All right, come here, buddy. I got you. I got you"
16312,Klaus, There it is. You want to save your brother? How 'bout a decade-long bender? And I have big plans for you when we leave this town
16313,Stefan, I'm not like that anymore
16314,Klaus," Well, that's too bad. You would have made a hell of a wingman"
16315,Stefan, Wait
16316,Klaus, Now that's more like it. I want you to join me for a drink
16317,Klaus," Finish it. All of it. You do everything I say, and I save your brother. That's the deal"
16318,Klaus, Again
16319,Alaric, Is this even possible?
16320,Bonnie, There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it
16321,Bonnie, No
16322,Alaric, What? What is it?
16323,Bonnie, They're angry at me for coming back here. They don't wanna help
16324,Alaric," Well, they have to"
16325,Bonnie, They said there'll be consequences
16326,Alaric," Well, he's just a kid. Tell 'em to shut up"
16327,Bonnie, Emily. Emily! I know you're there. Please help me. I love him
16328,Bonnie, No!
16329,Bonnie, Oh my god
16330,Jeremy, Bonnie
16331,Bonnie," Oh, my God, Jeremy. Oh, my God"
16332,Jeremy, What happened?
16333,Bonnie, Doesn't matter. You're ok. You're ok
16334,Bonnie, Thank you
16335,Damon, Elena
16336,Elena, Damon
16337,Elena," Hey, come on. Come on. We have to get you out of here. We have to hide you"
16338,Damon, where are we going?
16339,Katherine, Everywhere!
16340,Damon, Wait for me. I want to come with you
16341,Elena, Hey. Hey. Relax. We need to get you out of here
16342,Katherine, You're faster than I though
16343,Damon, Why must you always run from me?
16344,Katherine, Because I know that you will chase
16345,Damon, Then let me chase you forever. Feed me your bl*od
16346,Katherine," I will not feed you, Damon. If you want it, take it"
16347,Katherine, It is your choice to make
16348,Damon," I choose you, Katherine"
16349,Elena, Look at me. Hey. It's Elena. It's Elena
16350,Damon, Promise me you will not tell my brother
16351,Katherine, I promise. It will be our little secret
16352,Elena, No. Damon. No
16353,Damon, I have to... If we are to be together forever
16354,Elena," Damon, stop. You're hurting me. Damon, you don't have to do this. Please stop. You're hurting me!"
16355,Damon, Elena
16356,Caroline, That was Bonnie. Jeremy's alive
16357,Sheriff Forbes, I thought I k*ll him
16358,Caroline, You did
16359,Sheriff Forbes, I don't understand
16360,Caroline, I explained it to you once. I... I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do. But now... I don't wanna lie. I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore. I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore. I'm still your little girl
16361,Caroline," It's me. It's me, mom"
16362,Bonnie, Hey. How you doing?
16363,Jeremy," Trying to figure out what's wrong with me. Feel different, weird"
16364,Bonnie," Yeah, you were dead. It'd be weird if you felt normal"
16365,Jeremy," Bonnie, I, uh... I don't know how to thank you"
16366,Bonnie," You can thank me tomorrow. And the day after that. And the day after that. Good night, Jeremy"
16367,Jeremy, Good night
16368,Alaric," Hey, bud. I've gotta take off. Need anything?"
16369,Jeremy," Uh, no, no. I think I'm good"
16370,Alaric," You know, uh, on second thought, I might just crash here. Is that cool?"
16371,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah. Sure. Whatever"
16372,Alaric, All right
16373,Jeremy," Alaric, um... Thank you for everything"
16374,Alaric," Ah, you can thank me tomorrow... And the day after that, the day after that"
16375,Jeremy," Dude, come on! I knew you were listening"
16376,Alaric, And the day after that
16377,Damon, Elena
16378,Elena," It's ok, Damon. I'm right here"
16379,Damon," Elena, get out of here. I could hurt you"
16380,Elena, No. You won't. I'm here until the very end. I'm not leaving you
16381,Damon, Get out of here
16382,Elena," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hang on. Shh. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok"
16383,Damon," It's not ok. It's not ok. All those years, I've blamed Stefan. No one forced me to love her. It was my own choice"
16384,Elena, Shh
16385,Damon, I made the wrong choice. You tell Stefan I'm sorry. Ok?
16386,Klaus, You're very cooperative. It's almost as if you're enjoying it
16387,Stefan, No more. Not until you give me the cure
16388,Klaus," Not until we make a deal. It's your choice, Stefan. You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls, or you can embrace what you truly are, leave town with me, and save your brother's life"
16389,Klaus, That's the spirit
16390,Klaus, Sweetheart...
16391,Klaus, Take this over to Damon and come right back
16392,Katherine, You want me to leave?
16393,Stefan, No!
16394,Klaus, Yes and if I were you...
16395,Klaus, I'd hurry
16396,Stefan, She'll never take it to him. She'll never take it to him
16397,Damon, This is even more pitiful than I thought
16398,Elena, There's still hope
16399,Damon, I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here. I deserve this. I deserve to die
16400,Elena, No. You don't
16401,Damon," I do, Elena. It's ok. 'Cause if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you. I'm so sorry. Done so many things to hurt you"
16402,Elena, It's ok. I forgive you
16403,Damon, I know you love Stefan. And it will always be Stefan
16404,Damon, But I love you. You should know that
16405,Elena, I do
16406,Damon, You should have met me in 1864. You would have liked me
16407,Elena, I like you now. Just the way you are
16408,Damon, Thank you
16409,Elena, You're welcome
16410,Katherine," Well, it's me you should be thanking"
16411,Katherine," I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure"
16412,Katherine, I thought you were dead
16413,Elena, I was
16414,Damon, You got free
16415,Katherine, Yep. Finally
16416,Damon, And you still came here?
16417,Katherine, I owed you one
16418,Elena, Where's Stefan?
16419,Katherine, Are you sure you care?
16420,Elena, Where is he?
16421,Katherine, He's paying for this
16422,Katherine, He gave himself over to Klaus. I wouldn't expect him anytime soon
16423,Elena," What do you mean, ""he gave himself over""?"
16424,Katherine," He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you. It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company. Good-bye, Elena. Oh. It's ok to love them both. I did"
16425,Klaus," I suppose, brother, you've been reunited with our family"
16426,Klaus, Put him with the others. We're leaving town tonight
16427,Klaus, So... Did Katerina make it in time?
16428,Stefan," You won't be seeing her again, you know"
16429,Klaus," Because she's on vervain? I've been around a long time, Stefan. I rarely get played for a fool. Besides, she won't get far. You'll help me see to that"
16430,Stefan, What is it you really want from me?
16431,Klaus, All will be explained in time. Once we leave this tragic little town
16432,Stefan, Then are we done here? Can we go?
16433,Klaus," Not quite. You see, I have a gift for you"
16434,Klaus," Come here, sweetheart. Don't be afraid"
16435,Klaus," See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal... That you'll be of use to me"
16436,Klaus," I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt"
16437,Klaus, Now we can go
16438,Jeremy, Alaric?
16439,Jeremy, Alaric?
16440,Vicki, Jer
16441,Jeremy, Anna?
16442,Jeremy, Vicky?
16443,Girl, Rudy. Rudy! Come on. It's too hot to make me come looking for you
16444,Klaus, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you
16445,Girl, Can I help you?
16446,Klaus," Yeah, my, uh, my car ran out of gas a couple miles back. I feel like I've been walking forever. Yours is the first house I'd come to, so I was just hoping I could use your phone"
16447,Girl, Don't you have a cell phone?
16448,Klaus," Heh. Yeah. Battery died. Look, I promise I'm not a serial k*ll. I just want to use your phone"
16449,Girl, Sure
16450,Klaus, So...I can come in?
16451,Girl, No. I'll get the phone and I'll bring it out to you
16452,Klaus, I thought you country folks were supposed to be more trusting
16453,Girl, I'm from Florida
16454,Klaus," Well, that explains it"
16455,Klaus, Now show me a little Southern hospitality... Sweet pea
16456,Girl 2, I bet you a hundred dollars that dog ran off to a house with air conditioning
16457,Girl 2, What's going on?
16458,Klaus, Please don't be alarmed. I'm told Ray Sutton lives here
16459,Girl 2, He's almost never here. He's on the road mostly
16460,Klaus, But I expect he makes it home... Once a month
16461,Klaus, That's what I thought. Where is he now?
16462,Klaus," If I have to make you tell me, it's going to be infinitely more painful for you"
16463,Klaus, I love it when they run
16464,Girl 2, He's in Tulley. It's near the border. A bar called Southern Comfort. It's off Highway 41
16465,Klaus," Thank you, my love. Now..."
16466,Klaus, May my friend come in your home?
16467,Girl, Yes
16468,Klaus, k*ll this one quickly
16469,Klaus, Make that one suffer. I'll be in the car
16470,Girl," Please don't, please..."
16471,Jeremy," Ugh, early. Bad"
16472,Elena, It's not early. You're late for work. Matt just called
16473,Jeremy," Well, maybe they'll fire me"
16474,Elena, Aim high
16475,Elena, What are you doing?
16476,Caroline, Just shopping for the party you're trying to bail out on
16477,Elena, I never said yes in the first place
16478,Caroline," You were never going to, which is why I planned it anyway. And my mom wants you to call her"
16479,Elena, Did she find something?
16480,Caroline, An animal attack in Memphis. It's the third one this week in Tennessee
16481,Elena, And you're sure it's a vampire?
16482,Caroline," Yes, but that doesn't mean that it's Klaus"
16483,Elena, Doesn't mean it's not. I'll call her
16484,Caroline," Well, call on her cell"
16485,Elena," Tell her, thank you for her help"
16486,Caroline," All right, well, I've got to go. I'll see you in a bit"
16487,Elena," O, Caroline, wait. Just...keep tonight small. Please"
16488,Caroline, Wear something pretty
16489,Alaric," Was that, uh, Stefan news?"
16490,Elena, Could be more Klaus v*ctim
16491,Alaric, Are you certain Stefan's still with him?
16492,Elena, Easy to be certain when the alternative is that he's dead. Are you sure you're still ok on the couch?
16493,Alaric," Yeah, yeah. I'm good"
16494,Elena, Because you spent half the summer on it. If you need your own bedroom...
16495,Alaric, And sleep in your dead parents' room or my dead girlfriend's room...
16496,Elena, Right
16497,Alaric," Hey, Elena... Happy Birthday"
16498,Elena, Thanks
16499,Damon, We are out of champagne
16500,Andie," Huh. No, you ar out of champagne, 'cause I don't drink in the morning"
16501,Damon," Well, would you be a dear and..."
16502,Andie, I think you can probably get it yourself. I'm not your slave
16503,Andie," I mean, you're dripping... a little"
16504,Damon, Mm-hmm
16505,Damon, Mornin'
16506,Elena," Hey, I was going..."
16507,Elena, Ohh!
16508,Elena, You heard me. You knew that I was here
16509,Damon," You know, you should learn to knock. What if I was... indecent?"
16510,Elena, Sheriff Forbe gave us another location to check. Memphis
16511,Damon," Another dead end, you mean?"
16512,Elena, You don't know that
16513,Damon," You're right, Elena. This could be the one"
16514,Damon," After almost two months, this could be the clue that tells us Stefan's alive and well and living"
16515,Elena, Fine. I'll go by myself
16516,Damon, And let Klaus know that you're tracking him? He thinks you're dead. Let's keep it that way
16517,Elena," It's a new lead, Damon. We haven't had one in a while"
16518,Damon," Ok. I'll check it out. If find anything, I'll call you"
16519,Elena, But...
16520,Damon, He moved on to Tennessee
16521,Andie, That Florida v*ctim you had me look into had family in Tennessee
16522,Damon," Which one, the Pensacola guy?"
16523,Andie, Uh-huh
16524,Damon, You up for a road trip?
16525,Andie," Ha. No can't do. I have got to work, but I can see if I can get you an address"
16526,Andie, See you at the party
16527,Damon, Get me that address
16528,Jeremy, Ooh. You need to come home. It's boring around here without you
16529,Bonnie, You think you're bored? My dad's side of the family is like wet paint that never dries. How's the grill treating you?
16530,Jeremy," Well, it's teaching me the value of a mundane human experience"
16531,Bonnie, A summer job is good for you. You needed some normal in your life
16532,Bonnie, What was that?
16533,Jeremy," Nothing. Loo, I, uh, I got to get back to work. I'll talk to you soon, ok?"
16534,Bonnie," Wait, wait, Jeremy. Is everything ok with you?"
16535,Jeremy," Yeah. Yeah, normal and mundane. Come home soon, ok?"
16536,Jeremy, Vicki
16537,Matt, I need you to switch sections with me 
16538,Jeremy, Why?
16539,Matt, Caroline and Tyler just sat in mine
16540,Jeremy, So?
16541,Matt, So I don't feel like waiting on my ex-girlfriend
16542,Caroline, Something's up with your mother
16543,Tyler, Like what?
16544,Caroline," When I was over yesterday, she just kept eyeing me"
16545,Jeremy," Hi, guys"
16546,Caroline, Did Matt make you switch sections?
16547,Caroline, He thinks we're dating
16548,Tyler, So does my mother
16549,Caroline, What?!
16550,Tyler, We're together all the time. It's not a leap
16551,Caroline, It's crazy
16552,Barman," What's up, Ray?"
16553,Ray," Hey, Red. Can I get a beer?"
16554,Klaus, Ray? Ray Sutton?
16555,Ray, Who wants to know?
16556,Klaus," I've been looking everywhere for you. We started in Florida, Pensacola. I met a young chap there who you worked with you before you moved to Memphis. Now he directed me to two lovely young women. And they led me here"
16557,Ray, I think I'll be going
16558,Klaus," Not so fast, mate. You only just got here. Now your type are very hard to come by"
16559,Stefan, I wouldn't do that
16560,Ray, Vampires
16561,Klaus," You're swifty swift, Ray. Yes, my friend here is a vampire. He's compelled everyone in the bar, so don't look to them for any help. I, however... I'm something else. A different kind of monster. I've got some vampire, I've got some wolf"
16562,Ray, A...what?
16563,Klaus," A hybrid, Ray. I'm both. You see, I want to create more of me. Now, you being the first werewolf I've come across in many a moon, pun intended, Ray, heh, I need you to direct me to your pack. So... Where can I find them, Ray?"
16564,Ray," You can't compel me, it won't work"
16565,Stefan," I need a scotch on the rocks, please"
16566,Stefan," Ahem. Tell you what, Ray. We're going to play a little drinking game. Something I like to call truth or wolfsbane"
16567,Klaus," Oh, this is going to be fun, Ray"
16568,Alaric, Elena? I don't know why you just don't come clean and tell her where we are
16569,Damon, 'Cause Andie said this was a half-lead and I don't want to get her hopes up
16570,Alaric," Yeah, well, they're all half-leads, and I don't want to get hand I'm your accomplice. What do you want me to say to her? I'm practically living there"
16571,Damon, Still sleeping on the couch?
16572,Alaric," You know, I keep waiting for them to kick me out, but they don't. I don't know why. It's not like I'm helping or anything"
16573,Alaric, It's quiet
16574,Damon, Yeah. Too quiet
16575,Alaric, Vampire for sure
16576,Damon, Stefan for sure
16577,Alaric, How do you know?
16578,Damon," It's his signature. There is a reason they called him the ripper. He feeds so hard he blacks out, rips them apart, but ten when he's done, he feels remorse. It's the damnest thing. He puts the bodies back together"
16579,Damon, Definitely Stefan
16580,Elena, I feel like I have to fight Damon every single time we get lead on Stefan
16581,Tyler, Maybe he doesn't want to find him
16582,Caroline, Tyler!
16583,Tyler, What? He's into you. Isn't he?
16584,Elena," The only reason Stefan left with Klaus was so that he could save Damon's life. I mean, trust me, Damon wants to find him"
16585,Tyler, But you kissed him probably screwed with his head
16586,Caroline, Tyler!
16587,Caroline, I'm sorry
16588,Elena," I... don't worry about it. Look, yes, I kissed him, but it was a... It was a good-bye kiss. I thought he was going to die"
16589,Elena, Oh. I just missed a call from Bonnie. I'll be right back
16590,Caroline, Just because I tell you things doesn't mean you're allowed to know them!
16591,Tyler, Sorry. I've got to run if I'm going to change and pick up Sophie in time
16592,Caroline," Wait, you're bringing a date? slutty Sophie is your date?"
16593,Tyler," Hey, it's been kind of slow in that department. And... I am horny all the time now"
16594,Caroline," Yeah, tell me about it. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode. It's, um, a vampire thing. You know, I feel like our emotions are heightened and we're on overdrive"
16595,Tyler," It's a werewolf thing, too. It's like I can't turn it off"
16596,Caroline," Well, I hope you get lucky tonight"
16597,Tyler, I'll see you later
16598,Caroline, Yeah. See you later
16599,Alaric, What are you doing?
16600,Damon, Covering their tracks. Clearly they have no interest in staying in the dark. But I do
16601,Damon, Hang on
16602,Damon," Well, what do you know? Werewolves"
16603,Stefan," Ray, you can ended this right now. Just tell me where your pack gathers for the full moon"
16604,Ray, I can't
16605,Stefan," I know, I know, you live by a code and all that. But see, he's not going to let me stop until you tell me and I do whatever he says. That's the way it goes around here"
16606,Claudine, Hello Mr. Klaus. I have some information for you. He told me to tell you that he saw that guy's brother Damon at the farmhouse
16607,Klaus," Well, thank you, Claudine. You just tell your friends to keep up the good work with the neighborhood watch, huh?"
16608,Stefan, My brother's still on our trail?
16609,Klaus, He's getting closer. I'm going to have to deal with that
16610,Stefan," No, no, no. Let me handle it"
16611,Klaus, Why should I let you leave?
16612,Stefan, 'Cause you know I'll come back
16613,Klaus, Do I?
16614,Stefan, You saved my brother's life. I'm in your service
16615,Klaus," Oh, that almost sounds sounds so tedious and indentured. Aren't you even having the least bit of fun?"
16616,Stefan, I'll make sure that my brother doesn't bother us anymore
16617,Elena," Don't worry, I'm not going to lose it. At least not before the cake"
16618,Damon," It's your party, you can cry if you want to"
16619,Damon," Ah, Stefan. Such a pack rat. I got you something. I know I promised not to buy you anything, so don't worry, I didn't pay for it"
16620,Elena, You stole it?
16621,Damon, No. Found it
16622,Elena, My necklace. I thought I'd never see it again
16623,Damon, Alaric found it in his loft. I figured you'd be happy to get it back
16624,Elena, I am happy. Thank you
16625,Damon, You're welcome
16626,Elena, Can you...
16627,Damon," Ah, absolutely"
16628,Damon, Shall we?
16629,Damon," Ooh, hey, hey, hey. You don't want that"
16630,Damon, You want the cheap young stuff over by the cheap young people
16631,Caroline, You like? Don't answer that
16632,Elena," This is ""keeping it small""? What are drinking?"
16633,Matt, Where did you get that?
16634,Jeremy," Uh, Henry from the kitchen sold me a dime"
16635,Matt," So, what's got you on your spiral downward? I'm sure it's a lot more interesting to know"
16636,Jeremy, You do not want to know
16637,Matt, How bad can it be? I already know everything else. Go for it
16638,Jeremy," You know I died, right? And Bonnie used magic to bring me back to life"
16639,Matt," Yeah, Elena told me"
16640,Jeremy," The thing is, ever since I came back, I've been seeing... Things"
16641,Matt, What kind of things?
16642,Jeremy, Just...things I shouldn't be seeing
16643,Matt, What's Bonnie say about it?
16644,Jeremy," No, I haven't told her. I haven't told anybody. It's just messing with my head, is all. You know, I just need to chill out. So...this"
16645,Matt, Yeah
16646,Caroline," Oh, the stoner den. Buzz k*ll"
16647,Matt," Hey, guys"
16648,Elena," Matt, hey"
16649,Matt, Happy Birthday
16650,Elena, Thank you
16651,Caroline, He hates me. His hatred of me has driven him to drugs
16652,Elena, He doesn't hate you. He hates that he's not with you
16653,Elena, Is that my brother?
16654,Alaric, I am every parent's worst nightmare. I'm the chaperone teacher from hell
16655,Damon, I love high school parties
16656,Alaric, Isn't Andie supposed to be coming?
16657,Damon, 10:00 broadcast. She'll be here in a little bit
16658,Damon," Hello, birthday girl"
16659,Elena, Drink
16660,Elena, Jeremy's smoking again
16661,Damon, Is his stash any good?
16662,Elena, You're an ass
16663,Elena," Talk to him, please. He looks up to you"
16664,Damon, You're screwed
16665,Andie," Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh... bye... uh-huh. Ok, I... I'm the last person here again. Dave, I'm work, please. Can we do this in the A.M.? I have a party I have to get to and you have got to get a life Ok, all right, bye, bye, bye."
16666,Andie," Hello? Not cool, my retinas are burning"
16667,Andie," Ok, seriously? What... what the hell are you doing?"
16668,Andie, Hello? Hello?
16669,Andie," Oh, hi. Oh, Stefan. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? We have been looking everywhere for you! Stefan..."
16670,Matt, Since when are they a thing?
16671,Caroline, I thought you were ignoring me
16672,Matt, I'm not ignoring you
16673,Caroline," Well, you've only said five words to me all summer and those were four of them"
16674,Matt," Maybe because every time I've seen you, you've been with him"
16675,Caroline, Cause he's my friend. Which is what I thought you were
16676,Matt," Aren't you guys supposed to be, like, mortal enemies? I mean, isn't that how it works in the vampire-werewolf universe?"
16677,Caroline," Matt, shh! What is wrong with you?!"
16678,Matt," I don't know. I'm, uh... I'm out of it, I guess. Sorry"
16679,Tyler, What was that about?
16680,Caroline, Nothing
16681,Sophie," Great party, Caroline"
16682,Caroline, Thanks
16683,Caroline, Now leave it
16684,Tyler, What the hell?
16685,Damon, Andie wants me to pick her up
16686,Alaric," Your fake, compelled girlfriend wants you to be a chivalrous boyfriend?"
16687,Damon," Well, it's a complicated dynamic. Hold the fort down, will you?"
16688,Alaric, You mean the fort full of my drunk history students?
16689,Damon, Drink more. You'll feel less weird
16690,Caroline, This room's off-limits
16691,Elena, Caroline?
16692,Caroline, Sorry. I just needed to take a b*at
16693,Caroline, Are you hiding?
16694,Elena, I was just looking for Damon
16695,Caroline," Well, he' better be here somewhere, because we haven't even done the cake yet"
16696,Elena, I think I'm going to pass on the whole cake ting
16697,Caroline," No! No way, no! It's your birthday. No, it's the dawn of a new day, and you can't get on with your life until you've made a wish and blown out the candles"
16698,Elena," Is that what you all want me to do, just get on with my life?"
16699,Caroline, No. Maybe. I just don't think anyone wants to see you like this
16700,Elena," I'm not going to give up on finding Stefan, Caroline"
16701,Caroline, Of course not. And you shouldn't. But you have to admit that you're kind of just letting your life pass you by. And isn't Stefan the one who wanted to make sure that you live it?
16702,Elena, You want me to make a wish? I just want to know that he's alive. That's it. That's my wish
16703,Caroline," I'm sorry, hey, I'm just drunk and dumb tonight. You know"
16704,Caroline, What are you doing?
16705,Caroline, What's all that?
16706,Elena, It's Klaus. Damon's been tracking him without me
16707,Caroline, Why wouldn't he just tell you?
16708,Elena, I don't know
16709,Damon, Andie...
16710,Damon, Party central
16711,Elena, Where are you?
16712,Damon, I'm by the... Punch bowl
16713,Elena," Don't do that, Damon, don't lie to me. I saw your closet"
16714,Damon," Oh, oh, gotta go... gotta go break up beer pong"
16715,Elena," Wait, Damon... "
16716,Damon, Stefan
16717,Stefan," Hello, brother"
16718,Damon, You don't write. You don't call
16719,Stefan, Need you to stop following me. Causing some problems
16720,Damon," With who, Klaus? I'm supposed to care what he thinks?"
16721,Stefan, What you're supposed to do... Is let me go
16722,Damon," Saw your later artwork in Tennessee. Waling a fine line there, my friend. Keep that up and there will be no saving you"
16723,Stefan," See, the thing is, I don't need any saving. I just want you to let me go"
16724,Damon," Oh, I got a birthday girl at home who's not going to let me do that"
16725,Stefan," You know, maybe I haven't made my point. Hey, Andie, you still there?"
16726,Damon ,Andie?
16727,Andie," Damon? I can't move, Damon. He told me that I can't move"
16728,Damon," No, no, no, it's ok, Andie, stay calm. Not cool, brother"
16729,Stefan," Oh, come on. It's a little bit cool, huh? Hey, Andie. You can move now"
16730,Damon," No! No, no, no, no, no!"
16731,Stefan, I said... Let me go
16732,Jeremy, What ar you doin'?
16733,Matt, I can't find my truck
16734,Jeremy, That's probably a sign you shouldn't be driving it. Need a ride?
16735,Matt, You're more stoned than I am
16736,Jeremy, Ahh! What the... Vickie?!
16737,Vickie, Help me
16738,Matt, What'd you just say?
16739,Jeremy, Nothin'
16740,Matt," Did you just say ""Vickie"", as in my sister Vickie?"
16741,Jeremy," What? No, no. I, uh, I didn't say anything"
16742,Jeremy, No...
16743,Matt, What's wrong?
16744,Jeremy," You know what, maybe we should just walk"
16745,Caroline, Excuse me. Excuse me
16746,Tyler, Hey! What is your problem?! You're pissed that I brought someone?
16747,Caroline, Why would I be pissed? You brought a date. You're dating. That's...awesome
16748,Tyler," Ok, should I not be dating?"
16749,Caroline," Hey, you're horny all the time, right? I mean, a guy has needs"
16750,Tyler," 'Cause if I shouldn't be dating, all you've got to do is say something. If you don't say something, then I'm going to keep dating"
16751,Caroline, What would I say?
16752,Tyler," Don't do that, Caroline! I've already been there once with you, ok, and you said no. You shut me down. I'm not going back there again unless you make it crystal clear that you..."
16753,Tyler, Let's get out of here
16754,Caroline, Hey! You missed the cake
16755,Damon, What? What are you doing here?
16756,Elena, Why didn't you tell me? Why did you keep it a secret?
16757,Damon, Can we not do this right now? I'm having a really bad night
16758,Elena," All summer, every single time I came to you with a lead, you made me feel like an idiot for having hope"
16759,Damon, You were an idiot. We both were
16760,Elena," Tell me what you know, Damon"
16761,Damon," I know you need to get back to your party, Elena"
16762,Elena, we're supposed to be in this together. Why didn't you tell me you've been tracking Klaus' v*ctim?
16763,Damon," Because they're not Klaus' v*ctim, Elena, they're Stefan's!"
16764,Elena, What?
16765,Damon, He's left a trail of body parts up and down on the eastern seaboard
16766,Elena, No. You're wrong
16767,Damon," I've seen it happen before. He's flipped the switch, full blown ripper"
16768,Elena," Stop it, Damon"
16769,Damon," No, you stop it, Elena! Stop looking for him. Stop waiting for him to come home. Just stop! Stefan is gone and he's not coming back. Not in your lifetime"
16770,Matt," All right, I should probably go before Elena and Mr. Saltzman come home and see what a bad example I am"
16771,Jeremy, You sure you can walk?
16772,Matt, We'll see. Can I take the ice cream with me?
16773,Matt," What happened in the car, man?"
16774,Jeremy, Nothing
16775,Matt," Come on, man. You said, ""Vickie"". All right, you said my sister's name. Why? You said you were seeing things?"
16776,Jeremy, I've been seeing her
16777,Matt," I mean, I think I see her all the time, too. It's 'cause I miss her so much, though. You know, like, I want to see her so I do. Look, I know we've got our hands full with all that supernatural stuff in this town, but... Ghosts"
16778,Jeremy," Like I said, my head's all messed up"
16779,Klaus," Ok, it's a three step process, right? This is step one. I want you to drink from my wrist"
16780,Ray, I already told you where to find the pack. What more do you want from me?
16781,Klaus," Have you been listening to what I've been saying, Ray? I have great plans for you"
16782,Klaus," You'll thank me for it later, heh"
16783,Ray, What are you going to do now?
16784,Klaus," It's time for step two, Ray"
16785,Klaus, You're back
16786,Stefan, Did you doubt me?
16787,Klaus," Not for a second. I knew you'd pass the test. You still care for your brother, for your old life"
16788,Stefan, I don't care about anything anymore
16789,Klaus," You put on a good show, Stefan. I almost believe you. Let's hope, for your brother's sake, he does. You never stop caring about family, do you? But every time you feed, the bl*od makes it easier to let go"
16790,Elena, What are you doing?
16791,Alaric, Ahh. I'm not going to stay here anymore
16792,Elena, What? Why?
16793,Alaric," I'm not a role model. You know, I drink too much, I say the wrong things, I encourage bad behavior. At school I can pull it together, but in my own life.. The way I miss Jenna, it's just, I'm really not any good to anybody right now. I'm sorry, Elena. You're 18. You can do all this alone now. You can do it better without me"
16794,Elena, Hello? Hello? Hello?
16795,Elena," Stefan? Stefan, if this is you... You'll be ok. You can survive this. Whatever you do, I love you, Stefan. Hold on to that. Never let that go"
16796,Caroline, Mrs. Lockwood. Hi
16797,Carol, Leaving so soon?
16798,Caroline," I... I didn't mean to be so... I mean, we were just... I'm going to just... Get my purse. Ok"
16799,Damon," Just can't stay away, can you?"
16800,Elena, You've been dodgin calls
16801,Damon," Yeah, well, busy dating a dead fake girlfriend and all"
16802,Elena, Why didn't you tell me?
16803,Damon," Happy Birthday, Elena. Stefan k*ll Andie"
16804,Elena," He called me, Damon"
16805,Damon, What?
16806,Elena, Stefan called me last night
16807,Damon," Well, what'd he say?"
16808,Elena," He didn't say anything, but it was him. I asked sheriff Forbes if she would trace the call's origin. It came from Tennessee"
16809,Damon," Where he's binge drinking on the country folk. We went through this, Elena. Stefan's gone. I don't mean geographically"
16810,Elena," If he was gone, he wouldn't have called"
16811,Alaric," Go away, Damon!"
16812,Elena, Hi
16813,Alaric," You're, uh... Not who I expected"
16814,Elena, I need you to tell me what you know about Stefan and Tennessee
16815,Alaric, Did you miss the par where I checked out of all this?
16816,Elena," Come on, Ric. Whatever Damon knows, you know"
16817,Alaric, Ask Damon
16818,Elena," Yeah, but Damon's not exactly in the mood to help right now"
16819,Alaric, For good reason. Because it's not safe for you. Stefan's off the rails
16820,Elena," Yeah, but he's still holding on to his humanity, which means he can still be saved"
16821,Alaric, And why do you have to be the one to save him?
16822,Elena," Because I'm not the kind of person who checks out. Look, he would never give up on me. I'm not gonna give up on him. Tell me what you know, Ric. Please"
16823,Alaric," They've been tracking werewolves, he and Klaus. All over the eastern seaboard. We thought we had 'em just outside of Memphis..."
16824,Klaus, You ok? Is Ray getting heavy?
16825,Stefan, I'm fine
16826,Klaus," You sure about that? You know, we've been walking for quite some time now. If you need some water or a little sit-down..."
16827,Stefan," You know, I get that we're, uh... we're stuck together, but if we could maybe just skip the chitchat, it'd be great"
16828,Klaus," So much brooding. Your self-loathing is suffocating you, my friend"
16829,Stefan, Maybe it's 'cause I'm a little tired of hunting werewolves. We've been at it all summer
16830,Klaus," Thanks to our pal Ray, we found ourselves a pack. There"
16831,Woman," Ray! Oh, my God. What's going on? Who are you?"
16832,Klaus, The important question is who am I. Please forgive the intrusion. My name is Klaus
16833,Woman, You're the hybrid
16834,Klaus, You've heard of me. Fantastic
16835,Tyler," Hey, mom"
16836,Carol," Morning, sweetheart. Coffee's hot"
16837,Tyler, Rough night?
16838,Carol," Uh, rough week. I'm a little stressed. You?"
16839,Tyler, Feeling pretty good
16840,Carol," You know, if you're going to bring a girl home, I wish she'd have the tact to not sneak out like a prostitute"
16841,Tyler, I'm sorry. She snuck out?
16842,Carol, Hmm
16843,Tyler, Whoa. I think the cream's bad
16844,Tyler, Don't wait up tonight
16845,Tyler," Oh, and Caroline, she's not a prostitute"
16846,Carol," Bill, it's, um, Carol Lockwood. I've gotten myself into a bit of a vampire situation"
16847,Matt, Please tell me you're not turning into one of these losers that hangs out at work on his day off
16848,Jeremy," You remember what we talked about last night, how I've been seeing things?"
16849,Matt," Honestly, jer, last night is kind of a blur"
16850,Jeremy," Well, I saw her again.I saw Vicki"
16851,Matt, Why are you... why are you telling me this? You're dating a witch. Why don't you tell her?
16852,Jeremy," Tell Bonnie that she brought me back to life and now I'm seeing my dead girlfriend? We don't need a witch, ok? There's examples all over the Internet. We need..."
16853,Jeremy," Personal items, and it works best when a family member tries to make contact"
16854,Matt," No, no, no, no, no, no. We're... We're not contacting my sister"
16855,Jeremy," She said, ""help me"""
16856,Matt," If you're messing with me, man..."
16857,Jeremy," I saw her, Matt. She asked for help. You are the one she love the most. If anyone's gonna be able to help me to connect to her, it's you"
16858,Tyler," A lot of us like to keep to ourselves for the full moon, chain ourselves up. But there are some werewolves that like to gather in places were they don't have to do that, where they can enjoy it"
16859,Elena, What kind of places?
16860,Tyler," Mountains, state parks, deserts, that kind of stuff"
16861,Elena, Anywhere in Tennessee?
16862,Tyler, Yeah. Here. Give me your phone. I'll try to pull up a map
16863,Elena, Thanks for this. I know it's asking a lot
16864,Tyler," As Caroline likes to remind me, Stefan's in this mess because I bit Damon. I figure I owe you one. Have you talked to her today?"
16865,Elena, No. Why?
16866,Tyler, Just curious. Here
16867,Tyler, That's your best bet
16868,Alaric, Did you get anything?
16869,Elena, ow do you feel about a little hike through the smoky mountains?
16870,Alaric, You wanna hunt down a pack of werewolves on a full moon?
16871,Elena," We'll be out of there before the moon is full. If you don't come with me, I'm going by myself. What? You're the one who told me that I could handle things on my own now"
16872,Alaric," Yea, I meant like frozen dinners and SATs. A-all right fine. Let's just... Let's just go. But, uh, you're driving"
16873,Klaus," It's fascinating, actually... A werewolf who isn't beholden to the moon, a vampire who doesn't burn in the sun. A true hybrid"
16874,Klaus," Excellent timing, Ray. Very dramatic"
16875,Ray, What's happening to me?
16876,Klaus, Stefan?
16877,Stefan," Are any of you human? Your friend here needs human bl*od to complete hs transition to vampire. If he doesn't get it, he will die"
16878,Klaus," Doesn't take much, just a sample. Anyone? A boyfriend, a girlfriend, along for the ride?"
16879,Klaus, You
16880,Stefan," If you don't drink it, Ray, I will. Problem is I don't know how to stop"
16881,Klaus," It's the new order, sweetheart. You join us, or you die"
16882,Woman, I'd rather die than be a vampire
16883,Klaus, Wrong choice
16884,Klaus, She'll thank me for that later. Heh
16885,Klaus," Ok, who's next?"
16886,Matt, You moving in or something? You've been here forever
16887,Tyler," I thought I was meeting Caroline. You haven' seen her, have you?"
16888,Matt, Not keeping up on her comings and goings anymore
16889,Tyler," Look, man, I never meant for me and her being friends to be a problem for you"
16890,Matt, It is what it is. Tonight's a full moon. She usually helps you?
16891,Tyler, Yeah. Whatever
16892,Matt," Do you, uh... Is this like the kind of thing that you need another person for?"
16893,Tyler, I can handle it. But thanks
16894,Tyler, Ahh. What is up with my taste buds today?
16895,Matt, Heh. It's the vervain. The sheriff has me slip it into the coffee here every now and then
16896,Tyler, That's what vervain tastes like?
16897,Matt," Yeah. I'm surprising you can taste it, The coffee usually hides the flavour. For humans, anyway"
16898,Carol, Thank you so much for coming. Does anyone else know you're here?
16899,Bill, No. I didn't drive through town. I came straight here
16900,Carol, Can I offer you a drink?
16901,Bill, I think you should tell me what you expect me to do
16902,Carol," I was hoping you could tell me. It's Caroline, Bill. I remember the day when she was born"
16903,Bill, What does the rest of the council know?
16904,Carol, I haven't said a word. I've been putting this together on my own for months now. Any ideas how to handle this? I can't get my hands dirty here for a lot of reasons
16905,Bill," She's a vampire, Carol. We do what we have to do"
16906,Alaric," In a couple hours, the full moon's gonna rise just above that Ridge. If Tyler's right, that's where the pack'll be"
16907,Elena," You were a boy scout, weren't you? A boy scout, slash vampire slayer"
16908,Alaric, Slash whiskey-drinking all-around lost cause
16909,Elena, Wow. You came stocked
16910,Alaric," Well, we aren't exactly bird-watching. Here. Put that in your bag"
16911,Elena, Vervain grenade?
16912,Alaric, Wolfsbane
16913,Elena," Well, since we're exchanging gifts..."
16914,Alaric, That's John Gilbert' ring
16915,Elena, It was yours once. Go ahead. Take it. I'll protect you from whatever supernatural danger we're about to get ourselves into
16916,Alaric, He gave it to you
16917,Elena," Yeah, but I'm a doppelganger. It's not gonna work on me. He left it for I if ever have kids"
16918,Alaric," Yeah, well, then why don't you save it for future generations of stubborn, relentless baby Gilberts?"
16919,Elena," Ok, and how 'bout you borrow t until after we survive this? I'd feel bad if I got you k*ll before happy hour"
16920,Elena, I don't know why you think that you're a lost cause
16921,Elena, Damon! How are you even here?
16922,Damon," Thanks for the tip, brother"
16923,Elena, You sold me out
16924,Alaric, Think I'd take you to a mountain range of werewolves on a full moon without backup?
16925,Klaus," There. Good as new. Now you relax, ok, mate? We're gonna need you when the rest of them wake up"
16926,Ray, They're dead. They're all dead
16927,Klaus," Ah, he's through his transition. He should be feeling better soon"
16928,Stefan, So is this your master plan? Build an army of hybrid slaves?
16929,Klaus," No, not slaves. Soldiers, comrades"
16930,Stefan," For what w*r, might I ask?"
16931,Klaus," Oh, you don't arm yourself after w*r has been declared, Stefan. You build your army so big that no one ever dares pick the fight"
16932,Stefan, What makes you so sure that they'll be loyal?
16933,Klaus," Well, it's not difficult to be loyal when you're on the winning team. That's something you'll learn once you shake that horribly depressive chip off your shoulder"
16934,Stefan," That's why you're, uh... you're keeping me around? To witness my attitude adjustment?"
16935,Klaus, You'll know why I'm keeping you around when I've decided that I want you to know
16936,Klaus, Something's wrong
16937,Stefan," That shouldn't be happening, should it?"
16938,Klaus," Well, obviously"
16939,Damon," Get out of the water, Elena"
16940,Elena," If I get out of the water, you're gonna make me go home"
16941,Damon," Yes, because I'm not an idiot like you"
16942,Alaric," Right now, you're both acting like idiots"
16943,Elena, You gave up on him Damon
16944,Damon," I didn't give up on him, Elena. I face reality. Now get out of the water"
16945,Elena, No!
16946,Damon," What's your big plan, Elena? Huh? You gonna walk into a campsite full of werewolves, roast a marshmallow, and wait for Stefan to stop by?"
16947,Elena," My plan is to find him and help him. Damon, this is the closest that we've been to him since he left. I'm not going home"
16948,Damon," Klaus thinks you died when he broke the curse. That makes you safe. This, this is not safe"
16949,Elena, I'm not leaving before we find him
16950,Damon," It's a full moon tonight, Elena"
16951,Elena," Then we'll find him before then. Damon, please"
16952,Damon, Ok. Ok. But we are out of here before the moon is full and I'm werewolf bait
16953,Elena, I promise
16954,Damon, Unless you wanna relive that whole deathbed kissy thing
16955,Elena, I said i promise
16956,Damon, Fine
16957,Ray, You said it was gonna feel better. Why doesn't it feel better?
16958,Stefan, Some master race
16959,Klaus, Lose the attitude
16960,Klaus," Derek, come feed your girlfriend"
16961,Klaus, Go get him
16962,Damon, How you doing?
16963,Elena, Fine
16964,Damon," You know, I could help you"
16965,Elena," No, thanks"
16966,Damon, Just one little fwoosh
16967,Elena," Yeah, with my luck, you'd drop me"
16968,Alaric," What are you guys, 12? "
16969,Klaus, Where did he go?
16970,Stefan," He, uh... he got away. Forget him. Let's go"
16971,Klaus, A fatal werewolf bite. Ouch
16972,Stefan, Yeah. I'm gonna need your bl*od to heal me
16973,Klaus," Well, I tell you what. You find Ray, and then I'll heal you"
16974,Stefan, Can't be serious
16975,Klaus," You better hurry, 'cause that bite looks nasty"
16976,Tyler, You put vervain in my coffee this morning. Why?
16977,Carol, Vervain? What are you talking about?
16978,Tyler, Let's skip the part where we pretend we don't know about the vampires in is town. You were testing me to see if I was a vampire. I want to know why
16979,Carol, You've been spending so much time with Caroline. I had to know for sure
16980,Tyler, What does Caroline have to do with it?
16981,Carol, Let's skip the part where we pretend she's not one of them
16982,Tyler, Did you do something to her?
16983,Carol," Tyler, I don't want you to be with her"
16984,Tyler," Where is she, mom?"
16985,Carol, I can't let you be together
16986,Tyler, What did you do to her? Where is she?
16987,Carol, You can't be with her. She's a monster
16988,Tyler," You don't know about me, do you?"
16989,Carol," Know what? Know what, Tyler?"
16990,Alaric, We got about a mile left
16991,Damon, The sun's about to set
16992,Elena," I can see that, Damon"
16993,Damon, I'm just saying
16994,Elena, The moon doesn't reach its apex for a while. We have time
16995,Alaric, Stay where you are
16996,Ray, Vampire
16997,Elena, Damon!
16998,Alaric, Let me guess. Hybrid
16999,Matt," So this is all her stuff. We were supposed to donate it, but, uh, you know"
17000,Jeremy," Well, everything I read said that personal items help build a stronger connection"
17001,Matt, Does her pipre count?
17002,Matt," I don't know why I let you talk me into this, man"
17003,Jeremy, It's because she's your sister and you have a chance to help her
17004,Matt, I can't do this. You gotta go
17005,Jeremy," Matt, please"
17006,Matt," Nah, man. I can't do this, all right? You gotta go"
17007,Damon, These ropes aren't gonna hold him much longer. What else do we have?
17008,Elena," Ric, here. Take these"
17009,Damon, Aah! Ow!
17010,Elena, I said Ric
17011,Alaric," All right, that's the last of the vervain. We don't have enough stuff to hold him. I don't think we're gonna make that Ridge before the full moon"
17012,Elena," If we can get him to talk, we don't have to"
17013,Damon, Is he turning?
17014,Elena, It's impossible. It's still daylight
17015,Alaric, Tell him that
17016,Elena, There aren't supposed t be werewolves out here until the moon is full
17017,Alaric," You know, those ropes aren't gonna hold the wolf"
17018,Elena," Damon, we've got to get out of here. We gotta get out of these mountains now! Damon, now!"
17019,Klaus," Bad news, my friend. End of the road for you"
17020,Klaus," Careful, love. There's only one Alpha here"
17021,Klaus, Bloody Hell
17022,Damon, Don't move
17023,Damon," Here, doggie, doggie"
17024,Alaric, Come on. Let's keep moving
17025,Elena, We can't leave Damon
17026,Alaric, He can handle himself. Let's move
17027,Elena," No. If he gets bit, he'll be dead. I'm the reason he's out here"
17028,Alaric," I am the reason he's out here. I told him where we were, and I'm telling you to keep moving. Let's go. Elena, now"
17029,Carol," Tyler, what is it? Just... just tell me"
17030,Tyler, You need to see for yourself
17031,Carol, What are you doing?
17032,Tyler," You think Caroline's a monster? I'm the monster, mom"
17033,Carol, What?
17034,Carol," Tyler, what's happening?"
17035,Carol," Tyler, what are you doing?"
17036,Tyler," Me, Uncle Mason, it's in our bl*od. It's our family curse"
17037,Carol, What curse?
17038,Carol," Tyler, what's happening?! What's happening?"
17039,Carol," Oh, my God! Ohh! No! Ohh!"
17040,Damon, Fancy meeting you here
17041,Stefan," What part of ""don't follow me anymore"" got lost in translation,Damon?"
17042,Damon," Might want to take it up with your girlfriend. You don't want her chasing you, I'd stop with the late-night phone calls"
17043,Stefan, I didn't call her
17044,Damon, Sure you did. She's not gonna give up on you
17045,Stefan, She has to. Because I'm never coming back. Why don't you get her home? See if you could keep her there this time
17046,Elena," Stefan's out there somewhere and now Damon, and we're just sitting in this car?"
17047,Alaric, Let the vampires fight the hybrid zombie mountain man. I'll take care of keeping the humans safe
17048,Elena, I thought you were checked out of taking care of people
17049,Alaric, I know what you're doing. Don't. There doesn't need to be a lesson here
17050,Elena," You're better at it than you think, you know?"
17051,Alaric," Oh, boy, are you a sucker for a lost cause or what?"
17052,Elena," You're not a lost cause, Ric. You're just lost. But so is Jeremy, and so am I. Our family is gone. We don't have anybody. I'm sorry, but you don't have anybody either, so... We're kind of right for each other"
17053,Alaric," I'm keeping the ring, then"
17054,Elena, Damon
17055,Elena, Are you ok? Did you...
17056,Damon," Fine, bite-fre. Get back in the car, please"
17057,Elena, Can you just give me a minute to appreciate that you're not dead?
17058,Damon," I'll give you 10 seconds. 9, 8... hey, Ric, did you happen to see where I parked my car?"
17059,Elena," Damon, stop being such a caveman"
17060,Matt, I'm sorry about earlier
17061,Jeremy," Hey, don't worry about it, man. You know, it's, uh... It's a lot to ask."
17062,Jeremy, Heh. Come on in
17063,Matt," I spent the day going through her stuff. It was weird, you know, all the memories. I realize that most people didn't really get Vic. You know, they saw her as trouble and let it go at that. But you really got her. You know, you... you got her better than I did most of the time so... I don't know what we're gonna do with all this, but... here"
17064,Jeremy," You know, I don't remember her dying. I don't know if Caroline told you that when she told you everything"
17065,Matt," Nah, she didn't"
17066,Jeremy," Elena made them take that memory away from me, that I couldn't handle it. So whatever my last moment was with her, I don't have it"
17067,Matt, I don't either. I don't remember the last moment I had with Vicki before she was a vampire... When she was still my sister
17068,Vicki, Matty
17069,Matt, Do you see something? Is she here?
17070,Jeremy, You said you needed help. Tell me how I can help you please
17071,Vicki, I can come back. Help me come back
17072,Matt, What is she saying? Tell me
17073,Anna, Jeremy. Don't trust Vicki
17074,Klaus," They went rabid. Some of them, I k*ll. The others just... Bled out. In the end... They're all dead"
17075,Klaus, I did everything I was told! I should be able to turn them. I broke the curse. I k*ll a werewolf. I k*ll a vampire. I k*ll the doppelganger
17076,Klaus, You look like hell
17077,Stefan," Last I checked, I'm dying... And you don't want to heal me. I had to take him out. I didn't have a choice. I failed you. I'm sorry. Do what you have to do"
17078,Klaus, It should have worked
17079,Klaus, Bottoms up. We're leaving. It appears you're the only comrade I have left
17080,Elena, Seriously?
17081,Damon, I was wrong
17082,Elena, Are you drunk?
17083,Damon," No. I thought Stefan was gone, but I was wrong"
17084,Elena," You saw him out there? Damon, is he ok?"
17085,Damon," No, he's not ok, Elena. He's an insufferable martyr that needs his ass kicked... But he can be saved"
17086,Elena, What happened out there? You've change your mind
17087,Damon," I changed my mind because even in his darkest place, my brother still can't let me die. So I figure I owe him the same in return. I'll help you bring him back"
17088,Elena, Thank you
17089,Damon," But before I do, I need you to answer one question. What made you change your mind?"
17090,Elena, What do you mean?
17091,Damon," You were so hellbent on staying on that mountain, then you just gave up. So what changed your mind?"
17092,Elena," We were under attack, Damon"
17093,Damon, You had a bag full of w*apon and a teacher with an eternity ring. You could have kept going
17094,Elena, It was too dangerous
17095,Damon," It was too dangerous going out there to begin with, so what was it?"
17096,Elena, Why are you being like this?
17097,Damon," What changed your mind, Elena?"
17098,Elena," I didn't want to see you get hurt, ok? I was... I was worried about you"
17099,Damon, Thanks
17100,Elena," Yes, I worry about you. Why do you even have to hear me say it?"
17101,Damon," Because when I drag my brother from the edge and deliver him back to you, I want you to remember the things you felt while he was gone. Good night, Elena"
17102,Damon," How's it going, Ric?"
17103,Alaric, Know what you're doing there?
17104,Elena," No, I don't"
17105,Carol, I'll take care of it. I'll make sure nothing happens to her
17106,Tyler, Thank you
17107,Carol, I think we made a mistake
17108,Bill," Carol, you called me in to take care of this problem. Why the sudden change of heart?"
17109,Carol, Maybe a guilty conscience
17110,Bill, Don't feel guilty. They're not human. They're monsters
17111,Carol, What if we're wrong?
17112,Bill," My family's been committed to this fight for almost 150 years, Carol. You married into it, so maybe you don't understand, but I do. I know what my obligations are"
17113,Carol, Wait
17114,Caroline, Hello! Mrs. Lockwood?! Somebody!
17115,Caroline, Who's that? Mrs. Lockwood?! Please
17116,Bill," Hello, Caroline"
17117,Caroline, Daddy?
17118,Damon, You're interrupting my drink
17119,Katherine, Miss me?
17120,Damon, Where are you?
17121,Katherine," Lurking outside your window, pining away"
17122,Damon, What do you want?
17123,Katherine, I'm homesick. What have I missed?
17124,Damon," Well, Stefan's still Klaus' little prisoner and Elena still thinks she can save him and no one's thought about you since you left"
17125,Katherine," And what about you? I'm sure now that you've given up on your brother, you're plotting"
17126,Damon, I didn't give up on him. I just don't know where he is
17127,Katherine, Hmm
17128,Damon, But you do. Are you trailing them?
17129,Katherine, A hybrid who wants me dead and his sidekick who's off the rails? I couldn't be further away
17130,Damon, Which means you know exactly where they are
17131,Katherine, All I know is that Klaus pitched a fit once his hybrids didn't work. Now he's looking for some answers
17132,Damon, How do you know that?
17133,Katherine," Spend 500 years running, and there will be a few people along the way that are looking out for you"
17134,Damon, Is that what you're doing? Looking out for my brother?
17135,Katherine," Maybe, maybe not. I'm conflicted"
17136,Damon, Where are they?
17137,Klaus," Welcome back to Chicago, Stefan"
17138,Stefan, What are we doing here?
17139,Klaus, I know how much you loved it here. Bringing back memories of the good old ripper days
17140,Stefan," Blacked out most of them. A lot of bl*od, a lot of partying. The details are all a blur"
17141,Klaus," Well, that is a crying shame. The details are what makes it legend"
17142,Klaus," Word was the ripper of Monterrey got lonely, so he escaped to the city for comfort. It was prohibition. Everything was off limits then, which made everything so much fun"
17143,Gloria," Guess who my eyes have just spied, ladies? Looking for a good time, Mr. Salvatore?"
17144,Stefan," Save me a dance, Gloria"
17145,Stefan," Ooh. Please, help yourself"
17146,Rebekah," Oh, I always do"
17147,Rebekah," Careful, Mr. Salvatore. You're still wearing your date. She's lovely"
17148,Stefan," No, no, no. Who are you?"
17149,Klaus, Chicago was magical
17150,Stefan," Yeah, well, I'll take your word for it. Like I said, I don't remember most of it"
17151,Klaus," Ready to get down to business, then?"
17152,Stefan," Why am I still with you? We had our fun, your hybrids failed. I mean, don't you want to move on?"
17153,Klaus," We're going to see my favorite witch. If anyone can help us with our hybrid problem, it's her"
17154,Damon," Rise and shine, sleepy head"
17155,Elena, Aah! What are you doing?! Get out!
17156,Damon, You know you were dreaming about me. Explains the drool
17157,Elena," Ugh. Oh, my God"
17158,Elena, 6:00 A.M. seriously? Do you really have nothing better to do at 6:00 A.M.?
17159,Damon," Fine, don't come with me to bring Stefan home. See ya"
17160,Elena," Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What? What are you talking about? Where is he?"
17161,Damon, Windy city
17162,Elena," He's in Chicago? Well, how do you know?"
17163,Damon, It came to me in a dream. I was naked. You would have loved it. Start packing
17164,Elena, Is he ok?
17165,Damon," Well, let's just say he's not there to meet Oprah"
17166,Damon," Ooh. Put these in the ""yes"" pile"
17167,Caroline," Daddy, are you there? Why won't you talk to me? Dad!"
17168,Bill, Shhh. I'm so sorry this happened to you
17169,Caroline, Dad...
17170,Bill, I need an answer. How do you walk in the sunlight?
17171,Caroline, Just let me go
17172,Bill," Sweetheart, please, just answer me. Then we'll get on with it"
17173,Caroline, Is that all you want to know?
17174,Bill, That's all I want to know
17175,Bill, Interesting
17176,Caroline," No, dad, no! What are you..."
17177,Caroline, What are you doing? What are you doing?
17178,Bill," Your ancestors built this place. People figured it was for unruly prisoners at the jailhouse, but... They had something else in mind. Vervain in the ventilation system to keep their subject weak. Reinforced steel containment chair. And that"
17179,Caroline, What are you doing?
17180,Bill," bl*od controls you, sweetheart. This is how I'm going to fix you"
17181,Caroline, What?
17182,Damon," I sure Hope we find him, 'cause it would suck if the last momento of Stefan was that crappy old necklace"
17183,Elena," It's an antique, Damon. Like you"
17184,Damon, Read this. Paints a pretty little picture of Stefan's first experience in Chicago
17185,Elena, It's Stefan's diary. I'm not going to invade his private thoughts
17186,Damon, You need to be prepared for what you're about to see
17187,Elena, I've seen Stefan in his darkest periods. I can handle it
17188,Damon," Here's one. March 12th, 1922"
17189,Damon," ""I've blacked out days. I wake up in strangers' bl*od, in places I don't recognize with women I don't remember."""
17190,Damon, Ahh! I'm shocked! Stefan's not a virgin?
17191,Elena," Eyes on the road, grandma"
17192,Damon, Fine. Back to my game. Tell me if you see a Florida plate
17193,Rebekah," Sorry to crash the fun, boys, but some of us actually came here to hear the music. Not you"
17194,Stefan," Oof. I am so sorry, sweetheart. Are we offending you?"
17195,Rebekah, It would take a lot more than a baby face like this to offend me
17196,Stefan," Ahem. Hey, hey. You ever going to tell me your name?"
17197,Rebekah, Sure. When you earn it. Now do Gloria a favor and stick a sock in it
17198,Klaus," Looks familiar, doesn't it?"
17199,Stefan, I can't believe this place is still here
17200,Gloria, You got to be kidding me
17201,Klaus," So a hybrid walks into a bar, says to the bartender..."
17202,Gloria," Stop. You may be invincible, but that doesn't make you funny"
17203,Gloria, I remember you
17204,Stefan, Yeah. You're Gloria. Shouldn't you be...
17205,Gloria," Old and dead? Now if I die, who's going to run this place, huh?"
17206,Klaus, Gloria's a very powerful witch
17207,Gloria," I can slow the aging down some Herbs and spells. But don't worry, it'll catch up to me one day"
17208,Klaus," Stefan, why don't you go and fix us up a little something from behind the bar"
17209,Klaus," You look ravishing, by the way"
17210,Gloria, Don't. I know why you're here. A hybrid out to make more hybrids? That kind of news travels
17211,Klaus, So what am I doing wrong? I broke the curse
17212,Gloria," Obviously you did something wrong. Look, every spell has a loophole, but a curse that old... We'd have to contact the witch who created it"
17213,Klaus," Well, that would be the original witch. She's very dead"
17214,Gloria," I know. And for me to contact her, I'll need help. Bring me Rebekah"
17215,Klaus, Rebekah. Rebekah is a bit preoccupied
17216,Gloria, She has what I need. Bring her to me
17217,Stefan, What is this?
17218,Klaus," Well, I told you, Stefan. Chicago's a magical place"
17219,Stefan, But this is me. With you
17220,Liz, Caroline! It's mom. Just coming up for air after a few all-nighters at the station. I thought we'd have lunch and you could remind me I promised not to work so hard
17221,Caroline, No! Please! Stop! Please stop! Please!
17222,Caroline," I don't hurt anyone, I swear. Daddy, swear. I can handle the urges. I can!"
17223,Bill," If you could handle it, this wouldn't happen"
17224,Caroline," I'm sorry, i'm sorry"
17225,Bill," By conditioning you to associate vampirism with pain, in time, the thought of human bl*od will make you repress your vampire instincts completely"
17226,Caroline," That's impossible. Daddy, you can't change who I am"
17227,Bill," Yes, I can"
17228,Caroline, No
17229,Bill, You remember this feeling?
17230,Elena, Stefan could live anywhere in Chicago and he chose this?
17231,Damon," There used to be an all-girls high school around the corner, but it shut down for attendance issues. Weird"
17232,Elena," If you're trying to scare me into giving up and going back, it's not going to work"
17233,Damon, Shh
17234,Damon, Here we are. Stefan's second personality home
17235,Elena, Pretty obvious he hasn't been here
17236,Damon, Tour is not over yet
17237,Elena, Stefan hid his alcohol. What a monster
17238,Damon, Look harder
17239,Elena, It's a list of names
17240,Damon, Mm-hmm
17241,Elena, These are all of his v*ctim?
17242,Damon, Still handling it?
17243,Elena, What were you doing in the 1920s? Paving the way for women's liberation?
17244,Damon, I was around. Chicago's a big city. Stefan was a cocky ripper douche. But I could avoid him and still indulge in a few Daisy Buchanans of my own
17245,Elena, Where are you going?
17246,Damon, His old stomping ground
17247,Elena, I'm coming with you
17248,Damon, No. You stay here and whip up an actual plan. I'll come back when I find him
17249,Stefan, This doesn't make any sense. Why don't I remember you?
17250,Klaus," You said it yourself, that time had a lot of dark holes"
17251,Stefan," No, if you knew me, then why haven't you said anything?"
17252,Klaus, I'm a little busy right now. Memory Lane will have to wait
17253,Stefan, What the hell is going on? Answer me
17254,Klaus," Let's just say we didn't get off to a brilliant start. To be honest, I hated you"
17255,Stefan, It's beautiful
17256,Rebekah, A witch gave it to me. Supposedly it's magical
17257,Stefan, Is it?
17258,Rebekah," It brought me love, didn't it?"
17259,Klaus," It's late, Rebekah, we're leaving"
17260,Rebekah, Get off of me!
17261,Stefan, Who is this guy?
17262,Rebekah," Stefan, don't. He'll k*ll you. He's a lot stronger than he looks"
17263,Klaus," So this is the famous Stefan Salvatore. I've been hearing so much about. You're right, he does have funny hair. I'm bored. I want to go"
17264,Rebekah," Then go without me, I'm not your girlfriend"
17265,Klaus," No, you're my sister, which means... You have to do as I say"
17266,Stefan, Your sister. So I knew another original vampire
17267,Klaus," If you can't handle it, then don't ask"
17268,Stefan, I don't recognize her
17269,Klaus," Well, don't tell her that. Rebekah's temper is worse than mine"
17270,Klaus," Time to wake up, little sister. Any day now, Rebekah"
17271,Klaus, She's being dramatic
17272,Stefan," Look, why don't you just tell me what the hell is going on? I mean, you obviously want me here for a reason, right?"
17273,Klaus," Well, you have many useful talents"
17274,Stefan, Do I?
17275,Klaus," In fact, I learned some of my favorite tricks from you"
17276,Klaus," So Stefan, enlighten me. What makes you worthy of an original like my sister? She's pure vampire and you're no more than a diluted bloodline"
17277,Rebekah," Don't listen to him, Stefan. Nik's an elitist"
17278,Stefan, Hmm. And where's the rest of your family?
17279,Klaus," Well, let's see. Um... I k*ll most of them"
17280,Rebekah, But not all
17281,Stefan, And you're ok with that?
17282,Rebekah," Well, we all had the chance to choose a side. I chose the right one, eventually"
17283,Man, Where the hell's my wife?
17284,Stefan, I don't know. I give up
17285,Man," You think you're so tough? Hiding in your bar, drinking your liquor? A telephone call to Chicago P.D. might set you straight"
17286,Stefan," Lila? Lila, please. Come here for a second"
17287,Man," Oh, thank God. Come on, we're leaving"
17288,Stefan," Oh, no, no, no, no. No. You're sitting"
17289,Rebekah," Stefan, don't be mean"
17290,Man, What the hell are you doing?
17291,Stefan," Thank you so much, Lila. Why don't you go and bandage that up"
17292,Stefan, I'd like you to join me for a drink
17293,Man, What kind of sick freaks are you?
17294,Stefan," I said, drink!"
17295,Stefan, I dodn't catch your name
17296,Man, Go to hell
17297,Stefan, Do you want another sip?
17298,Man, Liam Grant. Liam Grant!
17299,Stefan," Have another sip, Liam"
17300,Stefan, Finish it
17301,Klaus, I was your number one fan
17302,Stefan, Why should I believe any of this?
17303,Klaus," When she wakes up, tell her to meet us at Gloria's bar. Then volunteer your carotid artery and let her feed until you die"
17304,Stefan, Where are you going?
17305,Klaus," You think I'm lying, Stefan. You and I knew each other. You trusted me with one of your secrets and now I'm going to prove it to you"
17306,Stefan, How?
17307,Klaus, We're going to your old apartment
17308,Gloria," Well, look what the wind blew in. Last I heard, you hated this place"
17309,Damon," Gloria. Damn! If I knew you were going to age like this, I would have stuck around"
17310,Gloria, I always did like you better. But I see your brother is still running in the wrong crowd
17311,Damon, You've seen him?
17312,Gloria, With Klaus. Bad combo
17313,Damon, You know where they went? 
17314,Gloria, They'll be back here later tonight. They're out running a little errand for me
17315,Damon, Gloria...
17316,Damon, Don't be a tease. What kind of errand?
17317,Gloria," I don't think so. You may be cute, but you're still a vampire"
17318,Stefan," April, 1922. Lexi found me last night, dragged me off the train tracks. Thinks she can make me care again"
17319,Stefan," June, 1924... Lexi's driving me crazy. More animal bl*od, more misery"
17320,Stefan," 1935... cravings are there, but it's easier. Lexi's on to her next project... Getting me to laugh"
17321,Klaus, What a charming little homestead. Do you feel that? Is anybody here?
17322,Stefan, It's been vacant for decades. People must break in all the time. Why'd you bring me here?
17323,Klaus," Your friend, Liam Grant, the one who drank his wife's bl*od... I never could figure out why you wanted his name. And then you told me your little secret. It was all part of your special little ritual"
17324,Stefan, To write it down
17325,Klaus, And relive the k*ll... Over and over again
17326,Klaus, You believe me now?
17327,Stefan, Look what I found
17328,Stefan, 1918. Single malt
17329,Klaus, Let's go and find someone to pair it with
17330,Elena, Finally! I called you an hour ago
17331,Damon, Make yourself presentable. I know where Stefan's going to be tonight
17332,Elena, I told you that I was practically discovered by Klaus and you're worried about what I'm wearing?
17333,Damon," I had an hour to realize what a bad idea it was to leave you here alone, process it, and move on. Are you ok?"
17334,Elena, Yeah
17335,Damon," Ok, good. Get dressed. You're all road-tripy and gross"
17336,Elena, So you know where he's going to be?
17337,Damon," Yes, with Klaus. So I'll distract Klaus and you deal with Stefan"
17338,Elena, Ok. Thank you
17339,Damon," But you're going to have about five minutes tops before that hybrid freak rips my heart out. So please, tell me you can do this"
17340,Elena, I can do this
17341,Gloria, Where's Rebekah?
17342,Klaus, She'll be here. I can't just conjure her on demand
17343,Klaus, What's with you? I thought Chicago was your playground
17344,Stefan, So this is why you asked me to be your wingman? Because you liked the way that I tortured innocent people?
17345,Klaus," Well, that's certainly half of it"
17346,Stefan, What's the other half?
17347,Klaus," The other half, Stefan, is that you used to want to be my wingman"
17348,Stefan, They're jealous. Your family wants you dead because they can never be what you are
17349,Klaus, What? An abomination?
17350,Stefan, No. A king
17351,Klaus," Look at us. Two sad orphans. My sister fancies you, you know. But... I should warn you, Rebekah doesn't do anything half-speed, and that includes falling in love. So just be careful. She's totally mad"
17352,Stefan, I appreciate the advice
17353,Klaus," And when the point comes where she inevitably leaves you... She can't help it, it's just who she is. Don't let your heart do anything stupid"
17354,Stefan," You know what, you're a good friend, Nik. I'm glad I met you"
17355,Klaus, To friendship
17356,Bill," I want you to know, when Carol Lockwood called and told me about you... I sat down and cried"
17357,Caroline," Dad, I'm ok. I've learned to adapt. I don't need to be fixed. I can't be fixed"
17358,Bill, I've always taught you to try your best. I need you to try your best now
17359,Bill," There, see? You're doing it"
17360,Caroline, I can't
17361,Bill," Yes, you can. Fight the urge"
17362,Caroline," Daddy, I'm starving"
17363,Bill," I know you are, car. Try"
17364,Caroline, Why? You know that this isn't going to work
17365,Bill, It has to work. It's the only option
17366,Caroline, Why are you trying to fix me?
17367,Bill, So I don't have to k*ll you!
17368,Caroline," Daddy, I'm sorry"
17369,Bill, The sun's gone down. We'll try again tomorrow
17370,Liz, Hello Bill
17371,Bill," Put the g*n down, Liz. I know what I'm doing"
17372,Liz, That's our daughter in there. She looks up to you. She loves you
17373,Bill," Then she'll trust me to do the right thing. Let me do this, Liz. Not because she's a monster. But because we love her"
17374,Liz, Tyler
17375,Bill, You're not going in there
17376,Liz, Go ahead
17377,Caroline, Tyler
17378,Tyler, It's ok. We're going to get you out of here
17379,Caroline, My ring
17380,Stefan," So I'm confused. If we were such great friends, why do I only know you as the hybrid dick who sacrificed my girlfriend on an altar of fire?"
17381,Klaus, All good things must come to an end
17382,Stefan, They're using wooden b*ll*ts. They know
17383,Rebekah, That means he's here
17384,Stefan, Who? Who's here?
17385,Klaus," Rebekah! Come on, we've got to go, sweetheart"
17386,Stefan, What the hell is going on?
17387,Rebekah, Stefan!
17388,Klaus, Go!
17389,Klaus," Stefan. I'm sorry, but the fun has to end here"
17390,Stefan, What are you talking about?
17391,Klaus," You must forget Rebekah and me. Until I say otherwise, you never knew us, Stefan. Thank you. I had forgotten what it was like to have a brother"
17392,Stefan, You compelled me to forget
17393,Klaus, It was time for Rebekah and I to move on. Better to have a clean slate
17394,Stefan, But why? You shouldn't have to cover your tracks... Unless you're running from someone
17395,Klaus, Storytime's over
17396,Stefan, I need another drink. A real one
17397,Stefan, What is wrong with you?!
17398,Damon," What is wrong with you? You k*ll Andie one day, you save my life the next. What are you good, bad? Pick one!"
17399,Stefan, Klaus almost saw Elena today. You have to get her out of Chicago
17400,Damon, She's not going anywhere until she's got you checked into vampire rehab and on the mend. Trust me. I've tried
17401,Stefan, She is the key to everything. Klaus can't know that she's alive
17402,Damon, What are you talking about?
17403,Stefan, She was supposed to die in the sacrifice and she didn't. Now Klaus can't create any new hybrids. His witch is seconds away from figuring that out. Tell Elena to go home and forget about me
17404,Damon, Tell her yourself
17405,Klaus, I see they've opened the doors to the riff raff now
17406,Damon," Oh, honey, I've been called worse"
17407,Klaus," You don't give up, do you?"
17408,Damon, Give me my brother back... You'll never have to see me again
17409,Klaus," Well, I am torn. You see, I promised Stefan I wouldn't let you die, but how many freebies did I really sign up for? And clearly you want to die, otherwise you wouldn't be here, so..."
17410,Damon, What can I say? I'm a thrill seeker
17411,Stefan, You shouldn't be here
17412,Elena, Where else would I be?
17413,Stefan, What do you want? Damon won't be able to distract Klaus for long
17414,Elena, Come home
17415,Stefan, How much clearer can I make it? I don't want to come home!
17416,Klaus," Oh, dear, what was that? I'm a little boozey, so you'll forgive me if I miss your heart the first few tries"
17417,Klaus," Ohh! No, that's not it. Hmm"
17418,Klaus, Ohh. Almost
17419,Damon, You want a partner in crime? Forget Stefan. I'm so much more fun
17420,Klaus, You won't be any fun after you're dead
17421,Klaus, Really?
17422,Gloria, Not in my bar. You take it outside
17423,Klaus," You don't have to negotiate your brother's freedom. When I'm done with him, he won't want to go back"
17424,Stefan," Klaus is obsessed with siring these hybrids. The second he knows you're alive, he'll figure out why it's not working"
17425,Elena," Look, I know you're trying to protect me, but I can't let you do it. Come with me, Stefan, please"
17426,Stefan," And what do you expect if I do? Huh? It's never going to be the same, Elena"
17427,Elena, I know that
17428,Stefan, I don't think you do. I've left bodies scattered from Florida to Tennessee. Innocent people. Humans
17429,Elena," Lexi found you like this before. In the twenties, and... And she saved you"
17430,Stefan," And you know what I did after that? I spent 30 years trying to pull myself together. To a vampire, that's nothing. To you? That's half your life"
17431,Elena," I can't give up on you, Stefan"
17432,Stefan," Yes, you can. It's done. That part of my life is done. I don't want to see you. I don't want to be with you. I just want you to go "
17433,Damon, You ok?
17434,Elena, Just drive
17435,Caroline, Thank you
17436,Liz," Honey, your dad... All our families, we have beliefs that have been passed on through generations. And we were taught never to stray from them"
17437,Caroline, You did
17438,Liz, You taught me to look at things in a different way
17439,Caroline, I just thought that he was the one who got me
17440,Liz, He did. He will again
17441,Caroline," Hey, mom? Thanks for believing in me"
17442,Tyler, Would now be a bad time to give you crap about sneaking out on me?
17443,Caroline, He hates me. My dad hates me
17444,Klaus," Rebekah... It's your big brother. Come out, come out, wherever you are"
17445,Rebekah," Go to hell, Nik!"
17446,Klaus," Hurry up, Rebekah. Let's go"
17447,Klaus, He'll be here any second. Do you want to die? We've been found. We need to move
17448,Rebekah, Not without Stefan
17449,Klaus, Stefan's not coming. We have to disappear. He'll draw too much attention. Let him go
17450,Rebekah, What did you do?
17451,Klaus, Come on. We don't have time for one of your tantrums
17452,Rebekah," I don't want to run anymore, Nik! All we do is run. I want to be with Stefan"
17453,Klaus, Fine. Then choose. Him or me
17454,Klaus, That's what I thought. Get in the truck. Let's go
17455,Rebekah," Good-bye, Nik"
17456,Klaus, Don't pout. You knew it wouldn't k*ll me
17457,Rebekah," Yeah, but I was hoping it would hurt more"
17458,Klaus," I understand that you're upset with me, Rebekah... So I'm going to let that go. Just this once. Brought you a little peace offering. You can come in"
17459,Rebekah, Stefan...
17460,Klaus, Now you remember
17461,Stefan," Hey, buddy, take a picture of my brother and me"
17462,Stefan, I remember you. We were friends
17463,Klaus, We are friends
17464,Klaus, And now the reason you're here. Gloria tells me you know how to contact the original witch
17465,Rebekah, The origninal witch
17466,Klaus, What do you have that Gloria needs?
17467,Rebakah, Where's my necklace? What did you do with it? I never take it off!
17468,Klaus, I don't know. I didn't touch it
17469,Rebekah," We need to find it, Nik. Now, I want it back!"
17470,Klaus," Tell me that's not what she needs, Rebekah!"
17471,Damon, Ok. You were right. He was there
17472,Katherine, I'm always right. Let me guess... it ended in tears and heartbreak
17473,Damon, Where are you?
17474,Katherine, Why? Do you want to come rub sunscreen on my back?
17475,Damon," I'm thinking Europe. Italy, maybe Or Spain. You were always a sucker for those lazy afternoons"
17476,Katherine," Keep guessing, Damon. Bye-bye"
17477,Man, Hey kid. Chicago P.D
17478,Stefan, I'm not afraid of you
17479,Man," Oh, I'm not here for you"
17480,Man, Have you seen these two?
17481,Stefan, I've never seen those people before in my life
17482,Man," Wrap it up, boys. We're through here"
17483,Rebekah, There has to be more to this dress
17484,Klaus, There's not
17485,Rebekah," So women in the 21st century dress like prostitutes, then. You know, I got dirty looks for wearing trousers"
17486,Klaus, You wore trousers so women today could wear nothing
17487,Rebekah, And what is this music? It sounds like a cable car accident
17488,Stefan, It's dance music
17489,Rebekah, People dance to this?
17490,Stefan, Hmm
17491,Klaus, Are we done?
17492,Rebekah, And why are you so grumpy?
17493,Klaus," I needed one thing from you for my witch to find out why my hybrids are dying, one thing. Your necklace. And you lost it"
17494,Rebekah, I didn't lose it. It's just been missing for 90 years
17495,Rebekah, So what do you think?
17496,Stefan, I like it
17497,Stefan, What? I said I like it
17498,Rebekah," I can always tell when you're lying, Stefan"
17499,Klaus," Nice one, good work"
17500,Stefan, You're the one that pulled the Dagger out of her
17501,Rebekah, I heard that
17502,Stefan, All right. I'm going to get some fresh air
17503,Damon, I just don't know why you want to bring chili to a potluck. Everybody brings chili
17504,Damon," Hey, Ric"
17505,Alaric, What's up?
17506,Elena, What time do you want to go to the Lockwood party?
17507,Alaric, Ah. Those founders parties aren't really my thing
17508,Damon," Show up, there's going to be nine other people that brought chili"
17509,Elena," It's an old family recipe, ok?"
17510,Damon, Yeah! I know. I knew your old family. They made sucky chili
17511,Alaric," Why are you here, exactly?"
17512,Damon, She knows
17513,Elena," He thinks I'm going to break. I'm not going to break. I am just going to keep making chili, pretend like I didn't just spend the entire summer looking for someone who didn't want to be found"
17514,Damon, She's in denial
17515,Elena, I'm not in denial
17516,Damon, No?
17517,Damon, You're still wearing this necklace. Isn't this the reminder of your unbreakable bond with Stefan?
17518,Stefan, What the hell are you doing here?
17519,Katherine, You two look chummy. Klaus' your new bestie?
17520,Stefan," You know, if he finds out you're in Chicago, you're dead"
17521,Katherine, Happy to know that you still care. So tell me if I'm wrong... Rebekah's necklace that Klaus is looking for... That's the necklace that you gave to Elena
17522,Stefan," Bye, Katherine"
17523,Katherine," Hey, hey. Wait. You're up to this thing, tell me..."
17524,Stefan, They don't know where the necklace is. I just have to keep them from figuring it out. I have it all under control
17525,Katherine," Please, tell me you have a better plan"
17526,Katherine," You do. Come on, Stefan. You're not the diabolical type. Whatever you're planning,"
17527,Stefan," Well, if the most diabolical woman I know can't seem to figure it out, then I must be doing something right"
17528,Katherine, Uh-huh. I forgot. You're bad now. Don't get too cocky. Klaus is smarter than you. He's smarter than everyone. And I've heard about that sister. Be careful. She'll ruin you
17529,Stefan, Happy to know you still care
17530,Anna, Jeremy
17531,Jeremy, Anna!
17532,Anna, You heard me
17533,Jeremy, What are you doing here?
17534,Anna," Wait, like heard me, heard me, or did it sound more like a..."
17535,Jeremy, Where have you been?
17536,Anna, I need to know you can hear me
17537,Jeremy," You drop in, you tell me not to trust Vicki, and then you disappear?"
17538,Anna, Jeremy! Tell me you can hear me
17539,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah, I can hear you, all right? What the hell! What is it?"
17540,Anna, I've been trying to get you to hear me for days. Yelling your name and screaming
17541,Jeremy, You have?
17542,Anna," What changed? I've been trying to get through to you, why now?"
17543,Jeremy, I was dreaming about you
17544,Anna, You were dreaming about me?
17545,Jeremy, I can't believe this is actually happening. That you're actually here
17546,Anna, I'm here
17547,Caroline, I come bearing gifts
17548,Elena, Please say that's not chili
17549,Elena, Bonnie!
17550,Bonnie, I'm back!
17551,Bonnie, I leave town for the summer and everything goes to hell for the both of you
17552,Jeremy, Bonnie!
17553,Bonnie, Jeremy
17554,Damon, So mayor Lockwood called your gay ex-husband to torture your vampire daughter
17555,Liz," Yes. I've been keeping him detained to make sure the vervain's out of his system. So you could, you know..."
17556,Damon, Can't we just k*ll him?
17557,Liz," No, Damon! He's Caroline's father"
17558,Damon, He sounds like a douche-bag to me
17559,Liz," Yeah, well, just 'cause you and I are on ok terms doesn't mean that I'm a suddenly a big advocate for your ""lifestyle"""
17560,Damon, Is that what you told him when you two got divorced?
17561,Liz, Double check him for vervain before you compel him
17562,Bill, You brought another vampire into this?
17563,Liz," It's the best thing for all of us, Bill"
17564,Damon," So, Bill, I hear you're into the whole daddy-daughter vampire torture thing"
17565,Bill, I was trying to help her
17566,Damon," Well, if there's anyone who doesn't need help, it's your annoying control freak of a daughter"
17567,Damon, He's vervain-free
17568,Liz," Just erase his memory, Damon"
17569,Damon," So, Bill, I have a question. What makes you think that you can change the basic nature of a vampire?"
17570,Bill, The mind's a powerful tool. It can be trained and retrained. You just have to be strong enough
17571,Damon," Oh, yeah? I completely agree. I actually happen to love mind control, myself"
17572,Damon, You will leave town immediately. All you remember is you came to bring your daughter back to school shopping
17573,Rebekah, You left us
17574,Stefan," Yeah, sorry. Retail therapy was making my head explode"
17575,Klaus, Tell me about it
17576,Stefan, What's she doing?
17577,Klaus, She's failing
17578,Gloria, It's hard to find something when you don't have anything to go on
17579,Rebekah, So use me. I only wore it for a thousand years
17580,Gloria, See? Now this one offers a solution
17581,Gloria," All right, give me your hand, sweetheart"
17582,Stefan," She's, uh, she's looking for the necklace, huh?"
17583,Bonnie, The problem with my dad's normal side of the family is normal made for a really boring summer
17584,Caroline," After the last few days, I would k*ll for a normal family"
17585,Caroline, Since when did you learn how to cook?
17586,Elena, Damon helped a little
17587,Bonnie, Damon's helping you cook now?
17588,Elena, Both of you stop judging. He's just trying to be a good... ow!
17589,Caroline, Ahh! Did I splash you?
17590,Elena," No, no, my necklace"
17591,Gloria, I can sense something
17592,Elena, It b*rned me
17593,Caroline, Maybe it's a sign you shouldn't be wearing it
17594,Bonnie, Caroline...
17595,Caroline," What, I'm just saying. If you're going to be ""cooking"" without Stefan"
17596,Bonnie, Let me see it
17597,Gloria, I found it
17598,Rebekah, So where is it?
17599,Gloria," It doesn't work like that, doll. I get images. There's a girl with her friends..."
17600,Rebekah," Yes, a dead girl with dead friends, if I don't get my necklace back"
17601,Gloria," Well, I'll have to dive back in to get the details"
17602,Klaus, So dive
17603,Gloria, I need more time. And space. You're harshing my ju-ju
17604,Klaus, We can wait
17605,Gloria, I'm sure you can. But that's not what I asked
17606,Stefan," Hey. Hey, you know, why don't we just come back later. I'm hungry anyway. I'll let you pick"
17607,Bonnie, I have an identification spell that might be able to tell me what magic affected the necklace.
17608,Bonnie," It's going to take a while, so tell me if anyone's coming, ok?"
17609,Caroline," So you're not, like, switching Salvatores, are you?"
17610,Elena, What?
17611,Bonnie, Caroline...
17612,Caroline, Stay focused
17613,Caroline," As your friend who worries for you daily, what is the deal with you and Damon?"
17614,Elena, There is no deal. He's been just as focused on finding Stefan as I have
17615,Caroline," Yeah, but that doesn't make him any less Damon. If my own father, who I love dearly, can't change me. No one's changing Damon. Not even you"
17616,Elena," Look, why are we even talking about this?"
17617,Bonnie, Hey guys
17618,Caroline, What are you doing?
17619,Bonnie, I'm not doing anything. It has its own magic
17620,Damon, I'm going to let you in on a little secret... Founders parties are just an excuse for the council to gather in back rooms and plot against vampires
17621,Alaric," Hey, uh, I think you need to take a b*at with Elena"
17622,Damon, Excuse me?
17623,Alaric," Whatever it is you two have going on, I think it's a bad idea"
17624,Damon," I don't really think it's your problem, Ric"
17625,Alaric," It is my problem. I'm supposed to look after her, and this is me doing that"
17626,Damon, What do you think I'm doing?
17627,Alaric, What I think is you need to take a b*at
17628,Liz," Damon? Sorry. Uh, the mayor just called the council meeting"
17629,Rebekah, My girl's dead. I'm bored
17630,Klaus, You weren't kidding about being hungry
17631,Stefan, Yeah. It's been a long day
17632,Klaus, Try being related to her
17633,Rebekah, You're being mean. And why are you being mean? You used to love me
17634,Klaus," It's been 90 years, Rebekah. Give him a minute"
17635,Rebekah, Why are you taking his side?
17636,Klaus," Because, my dear sister, I feel pity for any man who doesn't give you what you want"
17637,Rebekah, Will you stop making me out to be a brat? I am not a brat!
17638,Klaus, A thousand years of life experience says otherwise
17639,Stefan," Well, you're no picnic, either. I mean, I've only spent one summer with you and I feel like I want to blow my head off"
17640,Rebekah, Fantastic
17641,Stefan, I need to go
17642,Rebekah, Where's he going?
17643,Klaus, To write a name on a wall. It's a long story
17644,Jeremy," Anna? Look, where are you? We don't have much time"
17645,Anna, We've got all the time in the world
17646,Jeremy," I'm sorry about before. I just got, um, distracted"
17647,Anna, It's fine. I get it. Why haven't you told her?
17648,Jeremy," Well, she's been gone all summer"
17649,Anna," Yeah, I know that. Now why haven't you told her, really?"
17650,Jeremy," I don't know. You know, I don't even understand how any of this is possible"
17651,Anna," Well, it's kind of a push and pull. I'm pushing from the other side trying to contact you, and sometimes, like just now, if you pull..."
17652,Jeremy, The other side? Is that... Is that what it's called?
17653,Anna," That's what I call it. I'm all by myself here. It's like I'm a part of your world, only no one can see me. I'm just... On the other side"
17654,Jeremy," Wait, what about Vicki?"
17655,Anna," Whenever you say you see her, I feel something. A darkness. And when I try to tell you not to let her in, something crazy happens. Like, she's trying to push me out"
17656,Jeremy, Like the windows breaking
17657,Anna," Just be careful. Try not to let her in. 'Cause she can't get through if you're not open to it. You don't understand how amazing it is to finally be able to talk to you. I'm all by myself here. I mean, I don't have anyone"
17658,Anna, I'm sorry. I know you can't feel anything
17659,Jeremy, Do it again
17660,Gloria, There you are
17661,Stefan, Thought you were resting
17662,Gloria," Well, now we both have a secret"
17663,Stefan, What did you see?
17664,Gloria," It's what I heard that's interesting. You know, the girls with the necklace, they were talking about you"
17665,Stefan, Yet you didn't tell Klaus. Why?
17666,Gloria, 'Cause I wouldn't help that hybrid half-breed with anything. The necklace is a talisman from the original witch herself. I want it
17667,Stefan," Well, I'm sorry. I can't help you"
17668,Gloria," Don't be difficult. You know, I'd hate to have to tell Klaus what a liar his sidekick is"
17669,Gloria," Guess I've got to get it out of you the hard way, huh?"
17670,Stefan, What is this? Why can't I move?
17671,Gloria, Relax. It's just a little paralysis spell. Nothing major
17672,Gloria," Just got to get the information out of your pretty little head. You know, witches nowadays, they're into that new age stuff, but... I'm a little more old school voodoo"
17673,Gloria, This will stop that pesky healing
17674,Stefan, I won't tell you anything
17675,Gloria, You don't have to
17676,Gloria," You feel that? That's your essence. Your spirit. It lets me make a connection. Herbs help, too. Diviners, sage, witch hazel"
17677,Gloria, But my personal favorite...
17678,Gloria, Vervain
17679,Liz, There have no been no incidence of question since spring. It's been quiet
17680,Carol, Anyone else have anything to add to the minutes? Damon?
17681,Damon," Ah, no, I think the sheriff covered it, mayor Lockwood. Looks like we've made it through the worst"
17682,Carol," Well, I have nothing new to add, so thank you all for coming"
17683,Bill, I have a question. Do you three think that everybody on the council is clueless...Or just stupid?
17684,Bonnie," Ok, tell me if you see anything in these grimoires that involves precious medals or a symbol that resembles a necklace"
17685,Jeremy," Well, can't you just ask all the dead witches you were channeling?"
17686,Bonnie, I don't have access to them anymore. They cut me off
17687,Jeremy, Since when?
17688,Bonnie," Since I brought you back to life. I messed with the balance of nature and there were consequences. Hey. I'm sorry. I know I should have told you. I told Elena when it happened. I just didn't want you to feel weird about it, you know?"
17689,Jeremy," Hey, no, no, look, you don't have to apologize for anything. Ok? You didn't do anything wrong"
17690,Bonnie, Elena said you've been having kind of a hard time since then
17691,Jeremy," No, I'm fine. You know, just been, ah, a little out of it lately. So should I concentrate on the older books? Or, uh, I mean, how old is this necklace?"
17692,Bonnie, Old
17693,Anna, Jeremy. The darkness. It's here
17694,Bonnie, Jeremy!
17695,Bonnie, Are you ok?
17696,Jeremy, What the hell just happened?
17697,Bonnie, I have no idea
17698,Gloria," I'm impressed. You've got discipline, Stefan. It's not going to do you much good, but... Just let go, honey"
17699,Gloria," There you go, there you go"
17700,Gloria," There's the girl with the necklace. You love her. You'd do anything for her. And you have. A lot of darkness, a lot of guilt. All to keep her away from Klaus. Why would he be interested in one girl?"
17701,Stefan, Don't do this. Don't do this
17702,Gloria," She's the doppelganger. She's supposed to be dead, and that's why Klaus can't make hybrids, isn't it?"
17703,Katherine, This is creepy
17704,Katherine," Maybe you do need my help, after all"
17705,Caroline, Did Stefan ever tell you where he got the necklace?
17706,Elena, No. And I never asked. Hopefully Bonnie will be able to figure it out
17707,Alaric, Please tell me it's time to go
17708,Elena, Beyond. Where's Damon?
17709,Caroline, Probably off somewhere doing bad things to good people. Consider me the honesty police
17710,Elena, What is it?
17711,Alaric, What the matter?
17712,Caroline, It's my dad
17713,Elena, Why would he even show up here?
17714,Caroline, I don't know. But I can't...
17715,Elena, I get it. I'll call you later
17716,Alaric," Ok, what's that all about?"
17717,Elena, Speaking of doing bad things to good people...
17718,Damon," Wait, wait, Houston, we have a problem"
17719,Elena, Where have you been?
17720,Damon, Managing Bill Forbes. Apparently he's impervious to compulsion
17721,Alaric, How?
17722,Damon, I have no idea. But he threatened to out me. Don't get me started on the irony of that
17723,Elena, What did you do to him? How do you know the compulsion doesn't work?
17724,Damon," That's not the most important piece of information I mentioned, Elena"
17725,Alaric, What does he want?
17726,Damon, He wants to control the council. Says it's been compromised
17727,Alaric, It has!
17728,Damon, He wants to put vervain in the town's water supply
17729,Elena," Maybe it's not a bad idea. I mean, it'll help you keep yourself in control now that Stefan's not here to..."
17730,Damon, To what? To keep me in check? Make me behave? I should have k*ll him this morning
17731,Elena," He's Caroline's dad, Damon"
17732,Damon," Yeah, and when I k*ll him, she'll have one more parent than we do"
17733,Alaric," Oh, come on, Damon!"
17734,Damon," You're repeatedly k*ll my buzz today, Ric. Step aside"
17735,Alaric," Yeah, it's not going to happen"
17736,Damon, Your temporary funeral
17737,Elena," Damon, no! What is wrong with you?!"
17738,Katherine, I've been thinking about your diabolical plan
17739,Stefan, Oh. Do tell
17740,Katherine," Well, you must know that Klaus is too paranoid to ever fully trust you. But the sister, she loves you like it was yesterday. She's the easier Mark. But you can't just pretend to care, because Klaus will know better, so you do the opposite. You bond with him; Make her feel left out. That will only make her want you more"
17741,Stefan," Oh! So you mean, I'm, uh, I'm taking a page out of the Katherine Pierce playbook"
17742,Katherine," The only question is why, Stefan? I mean, I get it, you want to keep Klaus away from Mystic Falls, but...What else do you expect to get from it?"
17743,Stefan, You know what's funny? You keep talking to me like I actually trust you enough to tell you anything
17744,Katherine," Oh, come on, Stefan, we're beyond that. I saved you from Hilda the high voodoo priestess"
17745,Stefan," Ok. I knew them, back in the twenties. They were running from someone. Someone who scared them"
17746,Katherine, A hunter. I heard stories about him centuries ago
17747,Stefan, Don't you want to know why an original vampire who can't be k*ll is afraid of a vampire Hunter?
17748,Katherine, If you're planning on making a move against Klaus... I want in
17749,Stefan," That's good. It's good to want things, Katherine"
17750,Katherine, Stefan...
17751,Stefan," Katherine. I'm in this alone. If you're looking for a diabolical partner in crime, I suggest you look elsewhere"
17752,Caroline, How was football practice?
17753,Tyler, What are you doing here?
17754,Caroline, Hiding out from my dad. He's here
17755,Tyler, Are you ok? Do you want me to kick his ass?
17756,Caroline," Yes. No. I bought him the shirt he's wearing, it is really expensive"
17757,Caroline, And through everything... He's still my dad. You know?
17758,Caroline," God, you reek!"
17759,Tyler, What?
17760,Caroline, That is bad
17761,Tyler," No, this? This is sexy"
17762,Caroline, No! It's really bad
17763,Caroline," Oh! Hang on, my phone"
17764,Tyler," Oh, come on!"
17765,Caroline, I'm only answering in case it's a friend emergency
17766,Elena, It's an emergency 
17767,Damon," Whoa, whoa. Is that scotch? I figured you for an abstainer"
17768,Bill, Everything in moderation. Keeps the mind clear from...influence
17769,Damon, Like vampire compulsion
17770,Bill," Yeah, I tried to tell you..."
17771,Damon," Yeah, yeah, powerful tool. Got it. I'm impressed. Can't say I've ever seen that before"
17772,Bill," Well, it takes a certain human focus. It's a k*ll that I've been honing for decades. Plus, your technique... Is a little lazy"
17773,Damon, Duly noted. I'm curious. Why not just expose us to the council?
17774,Bill," I know you think I'm the bad guy here, Damon, but I would never expose my own daughter to those morons"
17775,Damon," It's a pretty risky move, taking me on, don't you think?"
17776,Bill," I knew what I was risking when I didn't leave town, but I figured... You're not self destructive enough to k*ll the sheriff's ex-husband"
17777,Damon, Makes you the third person to underestimate me today
17778,Damon," Whoo. You know, with all this behavioral modification going on around here, I almost forgot how good bl*od tastes when it's...Fresh"
17779,Bill, What are you going to do? k*ll everybody who discovers your secret?
17780,Damon," No, I'm not going to k*ll you, Bill. I'm just going to find pleasure in perfect little moments like this"
17781,Caroline, Daddy! Are you ok?
17782,Bill, I'm fine
17783,Caroline, Here. It'll heal you
17784,Bill, I said I'm ok
17785,Caroline, Grow up
17786,Damon, Let me teach this ass-wheel a life lesson
17787,Caroline, Just get out of here
17788,Damon, Or what?
17789,Damon," I'm stronger than you, little girl"
17790,Caroline," Well, I'm angrier!"
17791,Damon, Bummer. I love a good girl fight
17792,Elena," You can't do this anymore, Damon. Not in this town. Not around me"
17793,Damon, Why not? It's nothing I haven't done before. Why is it suddenly so important for everyone to keep me in check?
17794,Elena, Because I don't want you to be what other people think that you are
17795,Damon," What? A monster? Sorry to disappoint you, Elena, but last time I checked, I was still a vampire!"
17796,Elena, I guess I wish that you didn't have to act like one!
17797,Damon, I am not Stefan. How about you stop trying to turn me into him?
17798,Bonnie," Hey, Jeremy. There's ashes everywhere"
17799,Jeremy, I'll go grab the vacuum
17800,Bonnie," No, I got it"
17801,Anna, Are you ok?
17802,Jeremy, Don't
17803,Anna, What?
17804,Jeremy," Bonnie's here, ok? You've got to stop"
17805,Anna, I was just trying to warn you. I felt something bad. Dangerous
17806,Jeremy, You... you just can't pop up every time she and I are together
17807,Anna," It's a two-way street, Jeremy. I only pop up when you're thinking about me. That's why you haven't told her. Isn't it? You don't want her to know you still care"
17808,Jeremy, I can't do this right now. I can't. This is just too much
17809,Anna, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that
17810,Jeremy," Good-bye, Anna"
17811,Anna," Don't! Jeremy, please. Don't shut me out"
17812,Bonnie, What's wrong?
17813,Jeremy, You asked me before if something was wrong and I said no
17814,Bonnie, Yeah
17815,Jeremy, That was a lie. I was lying to you. When you brought me back to life...
17816,Anna," Say you can hear me, Jeremy. Please!"
17817,Jeremy, Something Happened...
17818,Anna, I am all alone!
17819,Rebekah, You're back. Finally. Nik went to check on the witch
17820,Rebekah," Dreary, isn't it? The family cargo"
17821,Stefan, Hmm. Why don't you undagger them?
17822,Rebekah," Because he would hunt me down and k*ll me. He's a vindictive little bastard, my brother"
17823,Stefan, But you still care about him. Why?
17824,Rebekah," Well, I hated him for a long time. It was exhausting"
17825,Stefan," You know, when I met you two, you were both on the run"
17826,Rebekah, Also exhausting
17827,Stefan, Who were you running from?
17828,Rebekah, What do you mean?
17829,Stefan," Last night I saw you, there was a man looking for you. You both seemed afraid. I just... I wouldn't think Klaus would be afraid of anybody"
17830,Rebekah," No one in this world is truly fearless, Stefan. Not even Niklaus"
17831,Stefan, Who was that man?
17832,Rebekah, I can't. Please
17833,Rebekah," If Nik knew we were talking about this, he would..."
17834,Stefan," No, no, no, I'm sorry"
17835,Stefan, Just forget I asked. Ok?
17836,Rebekah, He told me about the girl you loved. The one that died. He also told me that you're only with him because he saved your brother
17837,Stefan, It's true
17838,Rebekah, I think he secretly admires that about you. You'd sacrifice anything for family. Don't tell him I told you that
17839,Stefan, Your secret... Is safe with me
17840,Rebekah, Do you think you'll ever love anyone like you loved that girl?
17841,Stefan," One day, maybe"
17842,Rebekah," I can always tell when you're lying, Stefan"
17843,Stefan, What? I'm not...
17844,Rebekah, Don't bother. Your kiss already gave you away
17845,Klaus, Gloria's gone. She's cleared out. We need to find a new witch immediately
17846,Klaus, What's going on?
17847,Rebekah," Something's wrong. He was asking about Michael. He's not with us, Nik. I can sense it"
17848,Stefan, She's wrong. Klaus...
17849,Damon, Wake up!
17850,Damon," It took a bit longer than usual, huh? Might want to get that ring checked. Hope it's not going bad"
17851,Alaric, You k*ll me
17852,Damon, You pissed me off
17853,Alaric, You k*ll me!
17854,Damon," Ric, no hard feelings, all right? I was on a bit of a tear. Everyone was trying to tell me how to behave"
17855,Alaric," Well, maybe they finally realized you're just a dick"
17856,Caroline, I'm not going to say I told you so
17857,Elena, Thank you
17858,Caroline, But I did tell you
17859,Elena," Ok, you and Damon were both right. I was trying to change him. But if he wants to be in my life..."
17860,Caroline," Wait. I... It's been a long week, so I'm just going to be blunt. It doesn't matter what he does, Damon's gotten under your skin"
17861,Elena, That's not true
17862,Caroline," God, just admit it, Elena, ok? You are attracted to him! In all of his bad brother glory"
17863,Elena, No
17864,Caroline," Wait, no, you're not attracted to him, or no, you just won't admit it?"
17865,Elena," I can't, Caroline! If I admit it, if I even thought it for just a second... What does that say about me?"
17866,Caroline," It says you're human, Elena"
17867,Elena, Do you need me to...
17868,Caroline," No, I got it"
17869,Caroline, Hey
17870,Caroline, How's your...
17871,Bill," Oh, healed"
17872,Bill, Thank you. For coming to my rescue
17873,Caroline, You're welcome
17874,Bill," Bye, Caroline"
17875,Caroline, Daddy. I'm going to be ok
17876,Bill," You're a vampire, sweetheart. I don't think you'll ever be ok again"
17877,Liz," I understand where you're coming from, but..."
17878,Alaric," The Gilbert family is a founding family, and they deserve to have a voice on the council. I'm taking care of them, I should be that voice"
17879,Carol," That's not the way it works, Mr. Saltzman"
17880,Alaric," Oh, really? Well, then tell me how it does. The council's job is to protect the people of this town. Now your daughter's a vampire and your son's a werewolf. So who's looking after the actual people? Some of them may be family or friends, but they are still supernatural. They don't follow our rules or our laws, they look after themselves, and that's what we need to do. I'll see you at the next meeting"
17881,Elena, Hey there
17882,Bonnie, Hey
17883,Elena, I just saw Jeremy. He said that you still have my necklace?
17884,Bonnie," Yeah, I haven't figured out what's going on with it yet"
17885,Elena, I know. But I just... I feel weird without it. The whole Stefan of it all
17886,Bonnie, Okay
17887,Bonnie, Did Jeremy also tell you that he's been seeing ghosts of his dead girlfriends this summer?
17888,Elena, What?
17889,Bonnie, Vicki and Anna. He's been talking to them
17890,Elena, You're kidding
17891,Bonnie, I wish. It's because I brought him back to life. The witches said there would be consequences. Guess they were right
17892,Bonnie," You know, what am I supposed to..."
17893,Damon, I'll accept written apologies only
17894,Katherine, Are you two lovebirds fighting already?
17895,Damon, Katherine. Wonderful. What do you want?
17896,Katherine, I'm just a girl looking for a partner in crime. Feel like hitting the road? Getting the hell out of dodge?
17897,Damon, Impeccable timing. I was told I need to take a b*at
17898,Katherine, Is that a yes? I'll drive
17899,Damon, Why not? Walls are starting to close in on me around here. Where are we going?
17900,Katherine, Away from here. That's all I'm going to give you for right now. But believe me... It's good
17901,Stefan," Just give me a chance to explain myself, ok?"
17902,Klaus," No need. I'm not mad, I'm just curious. Rebekah seems to think you're holding onto something. A piece of your old life. The thing is, she's got flawless instincts, borderline supernatural. So I thought I would check it out. See for myself what it is you've been hiding"
17903,Klaus," Welcome back to Mystic Falls, Stefan"
17904,Caroline," Ohh! Oh, come on! Seriously?! Do you know how long it took for us to set all this up?!"
17905,Tyler," Forgot about senior prank night, huh?"
17906,Matt, Clearly
17907,Caroline, How could you forget? We've only been waiting for this since like freshman year
17908,Elena," Yeah, Matt. If I'm doing this, you're doing this"
17909,Matt, I'm kind of surprised any of you are doing this
17910,Bonnie, Caroline's making us
17911,Caroline," We're about to be seniors. These are the memories that stay with us forever, and if we don't..."
17912,Elena," And if we don't create these memories now, then what's the point of it all?"
17913,Caroline," Go ahead and make fun, I don't care"
17914,Tyler, You're all lame. And I've got ten more classrooms to prank
17915,Caroline, Hey! Where are you going?
17916,Elena, To superglue Alaric's desk shut. I'm making memories
17917,Caroline, I love you!
17918,Tyler," Get the faculty toilet seats, and Dana needs bodies in the gym. Let's go"
17919,Klaus, There's my girl
17920,Elena, Klaus!
17921,Klaus, You're supposed to be dead. What are we going to do about that?
17922,Katherine, Are you hungry? Let's stop for a bite. A truck stop. Or a trucker
17923,Damon," Oh, stop being cute"
17924,Katherine, It's not possible
17925,Damon, We've been driving around aimlessly for hours. Where are we going?
17926,Katherine, Far enough away so that you can't go running back
17927,Damon, Not to worry. Mystic Falls and I are on a bit of a break
17928,Katherine," You and Mystic Falls, or you and Elena?"
17929,Damon, Let's just say Elena and I are having a bit of difference of opinion on how I should behave
17930,Katherine," Ooh. Let me guess... Elena wants you to be the hero, and you don't like playing pretend"
17931,Damon, Something like that
17932,Katherine, Her loss
17933,Katherine, What are you doing?
17934,Damon," I thought I'd give it a sh*t. Truth is, you just don't do it for me anymore"
17935,Rebekah," Oh, he lives"
17936,Stefan, What happened?
17937,Rebekah, You took a b*at. My brother's been breaking your neck all afternoon. Quite the temper
17938,Stefan, Why did he bring us back to Mystic Falls?
17939,Rebekah, You can stop playing dumb now. It didn't take him long to figure out what you've been hiding
17940,Stefan, I'm not hiding anything. I've done everything Klaus has asked me to
17941,Rebekah," No, you just failed to mention that the doppelganger's still alive"
17942,Stefan, Where is Klaus now?
17943,Rebekah," With any luck, ripping that cow's bloody head off"
17944,Stefan, Where is she?
17945,Rebekah," You really do love her, don't you?"
17946,Rebekah, Consider me jealous
17947,Klaus," You put a rather large kink in my plans, sweetheart. The whole point of breaking the curse and becoming a hybrid was to make more hybrids. I haven't been able to do that. Now my bet is, it has something to do with the fact that you're still breathing"
17948,Elena," If you're going to k*ll me, just do it!"
17949,Klaus, Not until I know I'm right. But I do have ways of making you suffer
17950,Klaus," Attention, seniors. You have officially been busted. Prank night is over. Head on home"
17951,Klaus, You two. I remember you
17952,Dana, I'm sorry. Who are you?
17953,Klaus," Oh, don't worry, I wasn't in my right head last time we met"
17954,Klaus," Lift your foot up, please, Dana"
17955,Klaus," If she drops her foot, Chad, I want you to b*at her to death. Understood?"
17956,Elena," Don't, Klaus. You don't have to hurt anybody"
17957,Klaus," Oh, come on, love. Of course I do"
17958,Katherine, Why are we stopping?
17959,Damon, I thought we might want to stretch our legs. Take a break from the sexual tension. I'm tired of driving. It's your turn
17960,Katherine, Fine
17961,Katherine, Hey! I...
17962,Damon, We're not going anywhere until you spill your guts
17963,Katherine, Fine
17964,Katherine," Do you recognize this, hmm? A little birdy told me that Klaus wants to get his hands on it"
17965,Damon, Why would Klaus want Elena's necklace?
17966,Katherine," Does it matter? He wants it, and I have it. It's leverage, Damon. Always stay one step ahead of your enemy"
17967,Damon, I'll keep that in mind
17968,Katherine," But more importantly, when I stole the necklace from Bonnie, I found out something else... Something better"
17969,Damon," Oh, yeah? What's that?"
17970,Katherine, Are you willing to do whatever it takes to stop Klaus? No turning back?
17971,Damon, I'm not turning back
17972,Katherine, Good. 'Cause this isn't going to win you any points at home
17973,Damon, Jeremy? Really?
17974,Caroline, Do you think Matt's going to be ok?
17975,Tyler, I'm kissing you and you're wondering about your ex-boyfriend?
17976,Caroline," I'm asking you if you think our friend, who we both love, is ok"
17977,Tyler, I think he probably doesn't have a lot of people to talk to anymore. I think he's struggling more than he lets on. I think that I love how big your heart is
17978,Caroline," I just want this school year to be great, you know? I just want everyone to be happy. Even in the midst of all the crazy unhappy bits"
17979,Tyler, I'm happy
17980,Rebekah, You two are adorable
17981,Caroline," Uh, do we know you?"
17982,Rebekah," You're Caroline, Elena's friend, which makes you Tyler. The werewolf"
17983,Caroline, And who are you?
17984,Rebekah, I'm the new girl
17985,Tyler, Caroline!
17986,Bonnie," This is fun, right?"
17987,Matt, You sound like Caroline
17988,Bonnie," Come on, I am embracing her philosophy. You should be more into this"
17989,Matt, I know. Where's Jeremy tonight?
17990,Bonnie," I haven't talked to him all day. We're having, um... He, uh, he told me about seeing Vicki"
17991,Matt," Ohh. Good, I'm glad that you know"
17992,Bonnie, I'm sorry. Is it weird talking about your sister like this?
17993,Matt," No, I... I just kind of want to see her myself, you know? I mean, I never got to say good-bye to her"
17994,Matt," Do you realize that just last summer, you and I were lifeguards at the pool? And the only two problems I had in my life were that Elena was breaking up with me and I sucked at CPR"
17995,Bonnie, Everything was so different then
17996,Matt," Yeah. Now Elena's dating a vampire, you're a witch, my sister's a ghost, and... I'm... I'm just a guy who's wondering how life got so screwed up"
17997,Bonnie," It's crazy, Matt. I... I can't imagine what it must be like for you"
17998,Matt," It just, uh, kind of explains why I'm not that into senior prank night. I'll go grab a couple more rolls. Then we hit the gym"
17999,Vicki," I'm here, Matt. I can help you"
18000,Klaus, Keep it up
18001,Elena, Where's Stefan? What did you do to him?
18002,Klaus, Stefan's on a time out
18003,Elena," Bonnie, get out of here!"
18004,Klaus," Ah, I was wondering when you'd show up. Now we can get started"
18005,Klaus," Ah, Dana, why don't you relax? You and Chad sit tight"
18006,Klaus, I assume you're the reason Elena's still walking around alive?
18007,Bonnie," That's right. If you want to blame someone, blame me"
18008,Klaus," Oh, there's no need for blame, love. Just your witchy interference seems to have caused some undesirable side effects. And since you caused the problem, I'm going to have you find the fix"
18009,Tyler, Get off of me!
18010,Rebekah, Hush now
18011,Klaus, I'd like you all to meet my sister Rebekah. Word of warning... She can be quite mean
18012,Rebekah, Don't be an ass
18013,Elena, Leave him alone!
18014,Klaus," I'm going to make this very simple... Every time I attempt to turn a werewolf into a vampire hybrid, they die during the transition. It's quite horrible, actually"
18015,Klaus," I need you to find a way to save my hybrids, Bonnie. And for Tyler's sake... You better hurry"
18016,Matt, He k*ll him
18017,Elena, He's not dead. Klaus's bl*od will turn him into a vampire
18018,Klaus," And if Bonnie's successful, he'll live through his transition. Go on, then."
18019,Rebekah, So this is the latest doppelganger. The original one was much prettier
18020,Klaus," Enough, Rebekah. Take the wolf boy elsewhere, would you?"
18021,Klaus, Just ignore her. Petty little thing
18022,Matt, What are you going to do?
18023,Bonnie, I have no idea. The curse he's talking about is a thousand years old. My grimoires don't go back that far
18024,Matt, Can you ask those dead witches that helped you before?
18025,Bonnie, I don't have contact with them anymore... They cut me off when I brought Jeremy back to life. That's it! I can't contact the dead. Jeremy can
18026,Damon, I'm listening
18027,Katherine, What if I told you there was a way to k*ll Klaus? And not Dagger dead. Dead dead
18028,Damon," I'd say you were desperate and lying. Or drunk. Or desperate, lying and drunk"
18029,Katherine, Do you remember my friend Pearl?
18030,Damon, Vividly
18031,Katherine," Centuries ago, she told me about a vampire who knew how to k*ll Klaus. Then she wouldn't tell me any more"
18032,Damon," Well, why not?"
18033,Katherine," Because it was her leverage. She knew it was valuable information, and wouldn't share it with me"
18034,Damon," Well, this is all great... But she's dead"
18035,Katherine, Which is why I never brought it up. Because she only ever told one other person
18036,Damon, Who?
18037,Katherine, Her daughter. Anna
18038,Damon, Also dead
18039,Katherine, Which brings us right back around to...
18040,Jeremy, To me. Back around to me
18041,Elena, Stefan...
18042,Klaus," Come to save your damsel, mate?"
18043,Stefan, I came to ask for your forgiveness. And pledge my loyalty
18044,Klaus," Well, you broke that pledge once already"
18045,Stefan, Elena means nothing to me anymore. And whatever you ask of me... I will do
18046,Klaus, Fair enough. Let's drink on it. k*ll them. What are you waiting for? k*ll them
18047,Elena," No! Stefan, don't. He's not going to hurt me. He already said..."
18048,Klaus, She means nothing to you? Your lies just keep piling up
18049,Stefan," Let her go! I'll do whatever you want, you have my word!"
18050,Klaus," Your word doesn't mean much. I lived by your word all summer, during which time I never had to resort to this..."
18051,Klaus, Stop fighting
18052,Stefan," Don't do this, don't do this"
18053,Klaus, I didn't want to. All I wanted was your allegiance. Now I'm going to have to take it
18054,Stefan, Don't...Don't...
18055,Klaus," You will do exactly as I say when I say it. You will not run, you will not hide, you will simply just obey"
18056,Elena, No! Stefan!
18057,Klaus, Now k*ll them. Ripper
18058,Jeremy, This isn't going to work
18059,Katherine, I think that your witchy girlfriend's worried that you've run away with your ghostly lover
18060,Damon, Stop with the teeny bopper drama. Focus
18061,Anna, I'm not helping them
18062,Jeremy," No, it's ok to help"
18063,Jeremy, They're looking for a way to stop Klaus
18064,Anna, I don't care. Katherine is not a friend to you. Neither of them are
18065,Damon, What's she saying?
18066,Jeremy," Well, she doesn't want to help you"
18067,Katherine," My advice? If you want to make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs"
18068,Damon," Jeremy, I just want you to know, it's nothing personal"
18069,Jeremy, Ow! What the hell?!
18070,Anna, Jeremy!
18071,Damon," Anna, I know you can hear me. Tell us what you know. The sooner, the better for your little boyfriend here"
18072,Anna, They're looking for Mikael
18073,Jeremy, Mikael!
18074,Katherine, Mikael. Is that his name?
18075,Damon, Who's Mikael?
18076,Anna, The vampire who hunts vampires. You don't want to wake him. He will k*ll all of you
18077,Damon, What's she saying?
18078,Katherine, Hello!
18079,Jeremy," He's a vampire and a Hunter, and you guys would be idiots to wake him"
18080,Jeremy," What do you mean, wake him?"
18081,Damon, It's time to go find the keys
18082,Katherine, Mm-hmm
18083,Rebekah," We didn't have mobile telephones in my day. Would have made life a whole lot easier, I suppose"
18084,Caroline, Where's Tyler?
18085,Rebekah, He's dead. Ish
18086,Caroline, What did you do to him?
18087,Rebekah," Think of it as he's having a nap. When he wakes up, he'll be a hybrid"
18088,Rebekah, Ugh. Vomit
18089,Rebekah, Is that my neck...
18090,Rebekah, Why is that doppelganger bitch wearing my necklace?!
18091,Klaus, It's always nice to see a vampire in his true element. The species has become such a broody lot
18092,Elena, No. You did this to him
18093,Klaus," I invited him to the party, love. He's the one dancing on the table"
18094,Rebekah, Where is it?! Where's my necklace?
18095,Klaus, What are you talking about?
18096,Rebekah, She has my necklace. Look
18097,Klaus," Well, well. More lies"
18098,Rebekah, Where...is it?
18099,Elena, I don't have it anymore
18100,Rebekah, You're lying!
18101,Klaus, Knock it off!
18102,Rebekah," Make her tell me where it is, Nik!"
18103,Klaus," Where's the necklace, sweetheart? Be honest"
18104,Elena, I'm telling the truth. Katherine stole it
18105,Klaus," Katerina. Of course. Well, that's unfortunate. If we had the necklace it would make things a whole lot easier for your witch, but since we're doing this the hard way, let's put a clock on it, shall we?"
18106,Klaus," 20 minutes. If Bonnie hasn't found a solution by then, I want you to feed again. Only this time, I want you to feed on Elena. You know you want to"
18107,Elena," No, Klaus! Don't do this to him!"
18108,Klaus," No one leaves. If she tries to run, fracture her spine"
18109,Matt, Did you find Jeremy?
18110,Bonnie, No! I called him like 20 times
18111,Matt," All right, I'll grab my keys, we'll head to his house"
18112,Bonnie, Ok. I'll meet you by your truck
18113,Matt, What the hell?
18114,Matt, You've got to be kidding me!
18115,Vicki," Matt! I can help you, mattie, but I need you to hear me"
18116,Matt, Whoa! Vicki?
18117,Bonnie, What is taking so long? 
18118,Matt," This is going to sound crazy, but I think Vicki's trying to reach out to me"
18119,Bonnie, What?
18120,Matt, I think she can help us save Tyler
18121,Bonnie," No, Jeremy can help us save Tyler"
18122,Matt, We can't find Jeremy. We need to try something else. I have an idea but I'm going to need your help. Meet me at the pool
18123,Bonnie, I don't understand
18124,Matt, Jeremy can see ghosts because you brought him back from the dead. I need you to do that for me
18125,Bonnie," What?! No, Matt, that's crazy!"
18126,Matt," This is going to work, trust me"
18127,Bonnie," No, Matt, I can't do that kind of magic anymore"
18128,Matt," You don't need magic, Bonnie. You just have to be better than I was at CPR"
18129,Damon," Don't fall asleep, Jer. You might have a concussion"
18130,Jeremy," Thanks for the concern, Dick"
18131,Katherine," Oh, stop pouting. He took one for the team. Everyone back home will thank you once Klaus is dead"
18132,Damon, Where's my phone?
18133,Katherine, Do you need to check in with Elena? Make sure it's ok you pummeled her little baby bro?
18134,Damon, You know you have it
18135,Katherine, What can I say? I needed you present here and now
18136,Damon," Katherine, phone, now"
18137,Damon, Bonnie's been texting me
18138,Jeremy, What is it?
18139,Damon, It's Klaus
18140,Katherine," No turning back, Damon"
18141,Damon," Shut up, Katherine"
18142,Katherine," Hey, look at the big picture. The best sh*t at taking out Klaus is by finding Mikael"
18143,Damon, Stay with her so Anna can guide you. I'm going back
18144,Katherine, You're going to get yourself k*ll. The Damon I remember wouldn't have been that stupid
18145,Damon, I wouldn't have done it for you
18146,Bonnie," Matt, please! I can't do this. There's nothing else I can do!"
18147,Vicki, Matt. Matt
18148,Matt, Vicki?
18149,Vicki, Matt. Please!
18150,Matt, I can see you
18151,Vicki, I need you to listen to me very carefully. I don't have much time
18152,Matt," Why, what's happening? Where are we?"
18153,Vicki, It doesn't matter. I need you to give Bonnie a message
18154,Bonnie, It's ok. You're ok
18155,Elena," Caroline's dad! Stefan, he was able to resist compulsion. I don't know how, but he did it. Maybe it's possible"
18156,Stefan," Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's just mind control, right? Maybe it just takes some focus, a couple decades of training. No big deal"
18157,Elena," Stefan, you can control this. When that buzzer goes off, just... just drink from me"
18158,Stefan," You don't get it. I can't stop, Elena! I'm a ripper! A ripper doesn't stop! I listen to the words that come out of your mouth, and all I hear is the sound of your heart pumping bl*od through your body. And when that clock ticks down... I'm going to have to feed on you. And you want to know what's worse? I'm not going to be able to stop"
18159,Elena, I don't believe that. You can fight it. You just have to want it bad enough
18160,Stefan," Why, because I love you?"
18161,Elena," Yeah! That's right, Stefan. Because you love me. You'll fight because after everything that we've been through, you owe me that!"
18162,Stefan," You know what, you're right. You're right. I owe you everything. Because through all of this, you are the one thing that has kept me from giving up; from turning it all off. But I can't help what I am, Elena. The more bl*od that I get, the more I want, and if I get so much as near yours... You are dead"
18163,Tyler, Where am I? What happened?
18164,Caroline, Tyler
18165,Rebekah, Don't be shy about it
18166,Tyler, What's going on?
18167,Caroline, Klaus is turning you into a vampire. A hybrid. You're in transition
18168,Rebekah," Don't leave out the hard part, sweets. You'll only survive if your witch is successful. If not... You're pretty much dead"
18169,Caroline, You're going to be ok. Ok? It's going to be ok
18170,Rebekah, I wonder how she's doing
18171,Rebekah, Tick tock goes the gym clock
18172,Bonnie," As soon as you're feeling better, I'm going to k*ll you"
18173,Matt," It worked. I saw her, I saw Vicki"
18174,Bonnie, You did?
18175,Matt, She said she had a message for you
18176,Bonnie, For me?
18177,Matt, From the witch that put the hybrid curse on Klaus. She said that Elena shouldn't have survived Klaus' ritual. The hybrids can't transition because Elena's still alive
18178,Bonnie, Tyler...
18179,Matt," He's going to die, isn't he?"
18180,Klaus, I wouldn't be too sure about that
18181,Klaus," Given the choice, doppelganger or a hybrid, I go hybrid every time"
18182,Stefan," Elena, you're going to have run"
18183,Elena, But Klaus said that if I run...
18184,Stefan," I know what he said, but if you stay, it won't matter. Elena, please, please, please. There's no other way"
18185,Elena," There is another way, Stefan. It's for you to fight"
18186,Elena," Stefan... I love you. Fight, Stefan. Don't give up"
18187,Stefan, I can't hold it
18188,Stefan," Elena, run! Go!"
18189,Klaus, We've got to stop meeting like this
18190,Klaus, Now this is fascinating. I've never seen this before. The only thing stronger than your craving for bl*od is your love for this one girl. Why don't you turn it off?
18191,Stefan, No!
18192,Klaus, Come on. Your humanity is k*ll you. All the guilt must be exhausting. Turn it off
18193,Stefan, No!
18194,Elena, Stefan...
18195,Klaus, You're strong
18196,Klaus, But you're not that strong. Turn...it... Off
18197,Stefan, No!
18198,Klaus, Turn it off!
18199,Elena, What did you do?
18200,Klaus," I fixed him. But I think a test is in order, don't you?"
18201,Klaus, Ripper... Perhaps you'd like a drink.. From the doppelganger's neck
18202,Klaus," Well, the verdict's in. The original witch says the doppelganger should be dead"
18203,Rebekah, Does that mean we can k*ll her?
18204,Klaus," No, I'm fairly certain it means the opposite"
18205,Rebekah, What?!
18206,Klaus, Call it a hunch...
18207,Klaus, Elena's bl*od. Drink it
18208,Caroline," No! No, no, no, Tyler, don't!"
18209,Klaus," If he doesn't feed, he'll die anyway, love. Consider this an experiment"
18210,Klaus, There we go. Good boy
18211,Klaus," Well, that's a good sign"
18212,Elena, Where am I?
18213,Nurse," In the hospital, sweetie. You suffered through a terrible ordeal"
18214,Elena, I have to get out of here
18215,Nurse, Ah. Not an option. You've lost a lot of bl*od
18216,Elena, Wait... You're taking my bl*od?
18217,Nurse, Of course. It's very important for your friend Klaus
18218,Nurse," Don't fight it, sweetie. He told me you need plenty of rest"
18219,Rebekah, So the doppelganger isn't the problem. Her bl*od is the solution
18220,Klaus, Seems so
18221,Rebekah, How did you know?
18222,Klaus," Well, you know how much the original witch hated me. Do you honestly think I would do anything other than the opposite of what she says"
18223,Rebekah, A thousand years in the grave and she's still screwing with you
18224,Klaus," Well, it makes sense if you think about it from her perspective. It was her failsafe in case I ever broke the hybrid curse. The doppelganger had to die in order for me to become a hybrid, but if she was dead..."
18225,Rebekah, Then you couldn't use her bl*od to sire yourself a new species
18226,Klaus, Leaving me alone for all time
18227,Rebekah, Is that what this is about? Your obsession with hybrids. You just don't want to be alone?
18228,Klaus," What I want is to take my girl, take my hybrid the hell out of this one pony town. You know, why don't you, uh, why don't you get the truck? I'll get Elena"
18229,Klaus," Well, look who finally decided to show up to the party"
18230,Damon, Where is she?
18231,Klaus," Elena? Ah, she's making a donation to a greater cause"
18232,Klaus," I'm afraid I can't let you interfere, mate"
18233,Damon, You'll have to k*ll me
18234,Klaus," Oh, I would love to k*ll you, but I made a pledge to your brother, and unlike him, I keep my word. Although, you know what, thinking about it now, he probably doesn't car that much anymore"
18235,Damon, You don't want to know about your friend Mikael?
18236,Klaus, What do you know about Mikael?
18237,Damon, Just that he knows you're here
18238,Klaus, You're bluffing
18239,Damon, Katherine and I found him. Consider it our leverage
18240,Elena, Damon...
18241,Damon, Hey
18242,Caroline, Are you sure you're ok?
18243,Tyler," I'm great, Caroline. I mean, like, phenomenal. It's a rush. I wish I could explain it. Everything's just... Better"
18244,Tyler, This is going to be an amazing year
18245,Bonnie, You ready? I could still use a ride over to Jeremy's
18246,Matt," Yeah, just a second"
18247,Bonnie," Listen to me. I know you want to help, and I know you miss your sister. But what you did was reckless and stupid"
18248,Matt, I know. Bonnie. I know. But it worked. It was worth it
18249,Bonnie," You don't want to be a part of all this, Matt. You are the only one of us who actually gets to live your life like a normal person, no matter how lost you feel. Don't forget that"
18250,Matt," I get it, Bonnie. I'll be out in a minute, ok? Vicki's here. Watching me, and I just, uh, I just need a minute to say good-bye, ok?"
18251,Matt," Bon, seriously, I'm not going to do anything stupid, I just..."
18252,Matt, Vicki?
18253,Vicki," Hi, Mattie"
18254,Damon," Hey, have some bourbon. It'll help you forget"
18255,Damon," Yeah, it's strong. You know I can help you forget, too. At least the memories you don't want to keep"
18256,Elena, No. No compulsion. I need to remember. All of it
18257,Damon, I stole it back for you
18258,Elena," He's really gone this time. I watched it happen. After everything that we went through to get... to help him. Now he's just... Gone. Where were you, Damon?"
18259,Damon, I shouldn't have left. I promise you... I will never leave you again
18260,Stefan," Well, isn't this cozy?"
18261,Damon," What are you doing here, brother?"
18262,Stefan," Last I checked, I lived here. Klaus is gone, but he's asked me to keep watch on you until he returns. From now on, you're under my protection"
18263,Stefan," Mmm, by all means. Carry on"
18264,Katherine, How do you know that Anna wasn't tricking you?
18265,Jeremy, This is the place. It's the oldest wing of the largest cemetery in Charlotte. She said that a witch entombed him here in the nineties
18266,Jeremy, Look there
18267,Elena, Good morning
18268,Alaric, So the pressure of your punch ejects the stakes
18269,Elena, Easy enough
18270,Elena, That's weird
18271,Elena, Must be jammed or something
18272,Alaric," You're not strong enough. Better start lifting some weights, put some meat on your bones"
18273,Elena, Thanks for not sugar-coating it
18274,Alaric, You know what this is?
18275,Elena, A vervain grenade. I've used one before
18276,Alaric, Then you know the element of surprise is your only advantage when it comes to a vampire
18277,Alaric, Surprise
18278,Elena, Oh my god
18279,Elena," This isn't a joke to me, Ric"
18280,Alaric, You think I'm joking? Vampires will take whatever they want. They will hurt whoever they want. And they'll do it without remorse. It's their nature
18281,Elena, You don't have to use pronouns. You can say Stefan
18282,Alaric," Look, I get why you're here. Stefan hurt you. You don't want it to happen again"
18283,Elena, But you think that I'm crazy. To believe that I can protect myself from a vampire who's flipped the switch on his humanity
18284,Alaric, I think you found a way to get out of bed this morning. And that makes you the strongest person I know. I think that you can do pretty much anything
18285,Caroline, Here we are. Senior year
18286,Bonnie, Anyone else think it should feel slightly more empowering?
18287,Caroline," Ok. So prank night was a bust. But we are accepting it, and we are moving on"
18288,Bonnie," You're right. I mean, why should I let the fact that my boyfriend is seeing the ghost of his dead girlfriend hinder this experience?"
18289,Caroline, Yes! And why should I let the fact that my boyfriend was turned into a hybrid put a damper on an otherwise fabulous day
18290,Elena," Today's our anniversary. Technically, Stefan and I met on the first day of school last year"
18291,Caroline, Yeah. You win
18292,Bonnie, Are you sure you want to be here?
18293,Elena, I have to be here. I have to put it behind me. New year. New life
18294,Stefan," Uh-oh. Alexandra, left hand, please"
18295,Damon," Hey, the 2 brunettes on the staircase owe me a persian rug"
18296,Stefan," You mean, they owe us a persian rug? It's my house, too, brother. Ooh! Would you like a spin?"
18297,Damon, So this is what Klaus had in mind when he compelled you to protect Elena?
18298,Stefan, These ladies are helping me be all that I can be
18299,Rebekah, Where's Stefan?
18300,Damon, Who the hell are you?
18301,Rebekah, He left me here. My brother actually left me here
18302,Stefan," Oh, I'm sorry. Your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care"
18303,Damon, You're Klaus's sister?
18304,Rebekah," Rebekah. Pleasure, I'm sure. Which one's my room?"
18305,Stefan, You're not staying here
18306,Rebekah, Rude. Both of you. I'll see to it myself
18307,Stefan, So I guess she's staying here
18308,Jeremy, So what? It's not cool to talk to juniors anymore?
18309,Bonnie, Hey. Happy first day
18310,Jeremy, You mad?
18311,Bonnie, I'm not mad. I'm resigned to the fact I'm sharing space in our relationship with Anna and Vicki
18312,Jeremy, I haven't talked to Vicki in a while
18313,Bonnie," That's not the point, Jeremy"
18314,Jeremy," I know that. I know. Ok? But I had to see Anna again, Bonnie. She had information that Damon needed"
18315,Bonnie," I get it, Jeremy. But put yourself in my shoes. You loved both of them. And you guys didn't break up. They died. And you keep letting them back in"
18316,Jeremy, You think I want any of this?
18317,Bonnie," I, um... I think you have the power to decide whether or not you see them. Remember that. Ok?"
18318,Vicki, You were always so much better at being a part of this than I was
18319,Vicki, Sorry
18320,Matt, You can't just keep appearing like this. Freaks me out
18321,Vicki, I'm a ghost. It's all I got. And I couldn't appear if you weren't thinking about me
18322,Matt," Well, I was just thinking about our first day last year. I was worried about running into Elena and you said..."
18323,Vicki, Suck it up. Be a man. And show her what she's missing
18324,Matt," Yeah. Instead, she met a vampire"
18325,Vicki," You ok, Matty? You seem unhappy"
18326,Matt," Yeah, I just life stuff. You know, with you gone and mom not around, it's... A lot to deal with alone. I'm glad I get to talk to you, though. I miss you"
18327,Vicki," I miss you, too. What if I told you there was a way that you could help me come back?"
18328,Matt, What do you mean come back?
18329,Tyler," Donovan! What are you doing? Come on, man. Let's go!"
18330,Tyler, You talking to yourself?
18331,Matt, What's got you in such a good mood?
18332,Tyler," We're seniors, man. Life is good"
18333,Katherine," Come on, Mikael, breakfast"
18334,Katherine," Yummy. Mikael, wake up!"
18335,Katherine, What?
18336,Damon," What? What do you mean, ""what""? i've been calling you for 2 days"
18337,Katherine," Odd, that's exactly how long I've been ignoring you"
18338,Damon, Jeremy Gilbert told me that you found Mikael
18339,Katherine," Sort of. He's a little bit out of commission. He won't eat. And I've tried everything... Gravediggers, mourners, mice, rats, bats. He's just not interested"
18340,Damon," Well, try harder. We need him to k*ll Klaus so I can de-rippefy Stefan before he destroys my house "
18341,Katherine, Fine. I'll give it another sh*t
18342,Elena, Hey. Are you checking up on me? Because I'm fine
18343,Damon, Yeah. So... You might not want to come here for a while. We have a new housemate. Barbie Klaus
18344,Elena, Rebekah? She's living with you now? Why?
18345,Damon, She's stranded. Apparently Klaus left her in the dust after I name-dropped Mikael
18346,Elena, What about Stefan? What is he up to?
18347,Damon," Oh, you know. Journaling, reading, shaping his hair"
18348,Elena," Come on, Damon. I can handle it. What?"
18349,Damon, Is that the bell? Oh...Ring! Ring! Don't want to be late
18350,Elena, I forgot about the bonfire
18351,Caroline, You have to go. It's our first spirit squad event. And it sets the bar for the whole year
18352,Elena," Relax, Caroline. I'll be there"
18353,Caroline, Thank you. It's just that...
18354,Elena, Is that bl*od?
18355,Caroline, Oh my God!
18356,Tyler, What's going on?!
18357,Caroline, Vampire 101... don't wear your breakfast to school!
18358,Tyler, Chill out. It was just a bl*od bag
18359,Caroline, From where?
18360,Tyler, Rebekah hooked me up
18361,Caroline, Rebekah? And what are you even talking to her for?
18362,Tyler, Klaus told her to keep a watch on me. Protect his new asset
18363,Caroline, His what? Why are you amused by this?
18364,Tyler," I'm his first successful hybrid, Caroline. Don't you think that's the tiniest bit awesome?"
18365,Caroline," Oh, wow! I cannot believe you just said that"
18366,Elena," So, I'm going to go"
18367,Stefan," Hello, Elena"
18368,Elena, What are you doing here?
18369,Stefan, What do you mean? I'm going back to school. Go timberwolves!
18370,Elena, What?! Why?
18371,Stefan, Klaus wants me to keep an eye on you. I'm just doing what I'm told
18372,Elena, I'm going to be late for class
18373,Stefan," Oh, class is this way"
18374,Elena," Let go of me, Stefan"
18375,Stefan," Elena, do you think I want to be a senior for the 100th time? No. I don't have a choice in the matter. And neither do you"
18376,Elena, I said let go of me
18377,Alaric, Let her go
18378,Elena," Stefan, stop it"
18379,Stefan, You're not going to get in my way. You hear me? I will see you both in history
18380,Alaric, What the hell is he doing here?!
18381,Elena, Klaus compelled him to watch over me. Apparently I'm one of Klaus's assets now that my bl*od is the only way he can create a hybrid
18382,Alaric, Now he's a bodyguard?
18383,Elena, I don't know what he is. But he's definitely not Stefan
18384,Elena," Look, his being here is not good for any of us. We have to do something"
18385,Stefan, You're in my seat
18386,Alaric," Welcome back, seniors. Let's turn our brains back on, starting with this country's original founders... Native Americans"
18387,Rebekah, What about the vikings?
18388,Alaric, There's no evidence that viking explorers actually settled in the United States. Who are you?
18389,Rebekah, My name's Rebekah. I'm new. And history's my favorite subject
18390,Vicki, You've got no business in the stoner pit
18391,Matt, Figured you'd feel comfortable here
18392,Vicki, Touche
18393,Matt, So what do you mean that I can help you come back?
18394,Vicki," Right now, I can only come back when you're thinking of me. But there is a way that I can be free of that"
18395,Matt, How?
18396,Vicki, I know this sounds crazy But I have help from the other side
18397,Matt, The other side?
18398,Jeremy," Dude, what are you doing over here?"
18399,Matt, I could ask you the same question
18400,Jeremy," Just looking for my stoner lab partner. All right, see you around"
18401,Matt, Can he not see you anymore?
18402,Jeremy, He was talking to Vicki right out there in the open
18403,Anna, How?
18404,Jeremy," When he died and came back, he must have started seeing her. She said that she could come back, that she had help on the other side"
18405,Anna, Help? What kind of help?
18406,Matt, Who's helping you?
18407,Vicki, The witch I've been talking to says that there's a ritual. She can do magic from my side to push me over to yours
18408,Jeremy, Is it even possible? Could she come back?
18409,Anna, I guess if she had a stronger foothold
18410,Jeremy, Like an anchor?
18411,Anna, Exactly
18412,Vicki," Right now, I'm tethered to you. My only access point to your side is through you. But if she were to get a stronger foothold... I'll be able to come and go as I please... When I want, where I want. I won't have to rely on you"
18413,Matt," But you'll still be a ghost, Vicki"
18414,Vicki," In a town full of vampires, werewolves, and witches, I'll fit right in"
18415,Matt, Seriously. You're going to make jokes about this?
18416,Vicki, Matt! Relax. No one else will be able to see me
18417,Anna," She's bad news, Jeremy. There's nothing but darkness round her"
18418,Jeremy, This is Vicki we're talking about. All right? She's not a bad person
18419,Anna," You can't upset the balance of nature without a price. If she's using a witch's energy from the other side, you don't know what price she's going to pay"
18420,Vicki," I can be a part of this life again, Matt. Instead of being on the other side all alone. You won't have to be alone anymore either"
18421,Matt, What do I have to do?
18422,Cheerleader, Has anybody seen Dana?
18423,Rebekah, Sounds like you have an opening on the squad
18424,Caroline, What are you doing?
18425,Caroline, Hey. Hey. You can't just come here and infiltrate all our lives
18426,Rebekah," I'm only interested in yours. Your spank, your popularity"
18427,Rebekah, Maybe even your boyfriend
18428,Coach," It's not the ballet, ladies. Let's move! Let's move!"
18429,Tyler," I think we're done here, coach"
18430,Coach," Did you have a mental breakdown, Lockwood? Get back in line"
18431,Tyler, I have a better idea
18432,Tyler, Shut the hell up so we can go get drunk at the bonfire
18433,Coach," Hit the showers, gentlemen"
18434,Caroline," Try to be a little more subtle, Tyler"
18435,Tyler, Coming from the queen of subtlety? Relax. I'm in total control
18436,Caroline, Then why are you acting like this?
18437,Tyler," Drop it, Caroline. I'm fine. I've never been better. Klaus has given me this... gift"
18438,Caroline, What?!
18439,Caroline, My God!
18440,Tyler," Damn, girl's got moves"
18441,Stefan," Look at you being all fit. Hey, you going to the bonfire tonight? Sounds like fun, right?"
18442,Elena," Seriously, Stefan, leave me alone"
18443,Stefan," You think I'm annoying now? Wait till homecoming. Hey, who you bringing, by the way? don't want to be weird"
18444,Guy, I'm sorry
18445,Stefan," Watch it, Dick!"
18446,Elena, Who are you?!
18447,Stefan," I'm the guy who's been assigned to protect a human bl*od bag. I mean, no offense or anything"
18448,Stefan, What?!
18449,Mikael, No! Get it away
18450,Katherine, You need bl*od
18451,Mikael, Get it away from me
18452,Katherine, Happy?
18453,Mikael, Thank you
18454,Katherine," I remember you. Chicago,1920s. You were looking for Klaus."
18455,Katherine, You're not so scary for a... badass vampire vampire Hunter
18456,Damon, What? Are you going o bench press a vampire?
18457,Elena, Do you actually know hat's happening right now? Stefan called me ahuman bl*od bag. He's a completely different person
18458,Elena, Unh! What are you doing?
18459,Damon, Helping you out
18460,Elena, Damon!
18461,Damon," Come on, Buffy!"
18462,Elena, Stop it!
18463,Elena, Like one obnoxious Salvatore sn't bad enough
18464,Damon," You called. I'm here. What's your plan, oh warrior princess?"
18465,Elena," I want to lock Stefan up, at least until this Mikael guy comes, k*ll Klaus, and the compulsion breaks"
18466,Damon," Compulsion or not, Stefan's high on human bl*od, Ok? A lot of it"
18467,Elena, You've gotten him off of it before
18468,Damon," This is different. It's not a stint in rehab, Elena. His humanity's gone. Light's out. No one's home"
18469,Elena," Then do it for me, Damon. Every single time I look at him, I feel like I'm going to break. And I'm not going to give him that satisfaction"
18470,Elena, What are you doing?
18471,Damon, Feel that? It's a sternum. Solid plate of bone
18472,Damon," Right here, just below the ribcage, next to the spine, that's your way to a vampire's heart"
18473,Damon," I'll do whatever it is you need me to do, Elena"
18474,Damon, No one going to hurt you. Especially not my brother
18475,Elena, I'll lure Stefan away from the bonfire. Then when he's distracted...
18476,Alaric, I'll sh**t him
18477,Damon, Can't Bonnie just ju-ju him or something?
18478,Elena," I'm trying to keep Bonnie out of this. I don't trust that Stefan won't hurt her. Caroline, are you covered?"
18479,Caroline, Yes! I will make sure that the old Forbes jail cell is prepped and ready
18480,Damon," We're forgetting a key player here. Rebekah? Wherever Stefan goes, the blond ponytail tends to follow"
18481,Elena, Which is why it's your job to keep her away
18482,Damon," How?! She's an original. Last time I checked, we're out of daggers"
18483,Elena, So then preoccupy her with your charm
18484,Alaric, Might have better luck finding the dagger
18485,Damon, Are ever not going to be mad at me for a day?
18486,Alaric, Doubtful
18487,Tyler, Sorry I'm late. What's going on?
18488,Elena, We need you to raid your mom's vervain supply. Enough to keep Stefan down for a while
18489,Tyler, You can't do that to Stefan
18490,Caroline, Why not?
18491,Elena," Trust me, Tyler, it's in his best interest"
18492,Tyler, Yeah. It's not in Klaus's
18493,Caroline," But Klaus is the bad guy, Tyler. You know, why are you acting like some freaky, hybrid, slave Minion"
18494,Damon, Uh-oh
18495,Alaric, What?
18496,Tyler," Klaus made me who I am, Caroline. I owe him everything"
18497,Damon," Oh, boy"
18498,Caroline," Ok, can we cool it on the commentary, please"
18499,Elena, What is going on?
18500,Tyler, I'm just going to go
18501,Caroline, What are you doing?!
18502,Damon, He's been sired
18503,Alaric, What?
18504,Damon, Sired. He feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus's bl*od created him
18505,Elena, Loyal how?
18506,Damon, He'll seek acceptance from his master. It's really rare. But maybe not so much in hybrid
18507,Caroline, So how do I fix him?
18508,Damon, Get a new boyfriend
18509,Stefan, You all right there?
18510,Rebekah, I thought Tyler would be here
18511,Stefan, You're into Tyler now? It's kind of a Fickle
18512,Rebekah," When you're willing to give me the time of day again, then we'll talk. Until then, a girl has needs"
18513,Elena, Excuse me
18514,Stefan," Elena, hi. What are you doing?"
18515,Elena," I'm having fun, Stefan. You got a problem with that?"
18516,Stefan," All right, take it easy. We both know you're kind of a lightweight"
18517,Elena, Uh-huh. Really? You think I'm going to let a bl*od addict tell me how to drink?
18518,Vicki," Concentrate on me, Matty"
18519,Matt, This is too weird
18520,Vicki, Just focus. This is a good thing
18521,Vicki, Now say you accept me
18522,Matt, I accept you
18523,Vicki, Did you just...
18524,Matt, I felt that
18525,Matt," I feel that, too"
18526,Vicki, It worked. Oh!
18527,Vicki," I'm here, Matty!"
18528,Bonnie, Did you talk to Anna about this?
18529,Jeremy," She's on the other side, Bonnie. Ok. I thought she might know something"
18530,Bonnie, About what? I thought they were all alone over there
18531,Jeremy, Somehow Vicki's been communicating with some super strong witch
18532,Bonnie," If there's another witch involved, don't you think you should have come to me before you went to Anna?"
18533,Anna, Tell her not to be upset. I was just trying to help
18534,Jeremy," Not now, Anna"
18535,Bonnie, She's here?
18536,Jeremy, She's just trying to help
18537,Bonnie, I can't... I can't deal with this...
18538,Jeremy, Bonnie!
18539,Bonnie, Matt's trying to resurrect his dead sister. I think I'll go deal with that instead
18540,Vicki," Ah, I can feel this. I can feel everything"
18541,Matt, The Witch didn't mention this part?
18542,Vicki, Makes sense. Our deal was that she'd help me do what I need to do
18543,Matt," What are you talking about? What deal, Vic?"
18544,Vicki," Well, if I want to stay here, I have to help her restore the balance. Klaus's hybrids can't be allowed to survive"
18545,Matt," You can't k*ll Tyler, Vicki"
18546,Vicki," Not Tyler, Matt. It's Elena who's the key to creating the hybrids"
18547,Matt," What? Vicki, no!"
18548,Vicki," I'm sorry, Matty. But I want to stay"
18549,Rebekah, What? No friends your own age?
18550,Damon, Like you can talk
18551,Rebekah, Is this supposed to be fun? I've been through 10 of these
18552,Damon," No, you're just looking at it all wrong. This is a little rough on the outside"
18553,Damon, But the inside... Yum
18554,Rebekah, Mmm. It's good
18555,Damon, Yep
18556,Stefan, What's that look?
18557,Elena, What look?
18558,Stefan," My brother's got his flirt on, and you're jealous"
18559,Elena, I'm not jealous
18560,Stefan, It's all right. Be jealous by all means. I'm sure Damon will be thrilled
18561,Elena," I'm not jealous, Stefan"
18562,Stefan, All right. That's my mistake
18563,Elena, Whatever. I'm out of here
18564,Bonnie," Matt! Matt, slow down. What happened?"
18565,Matt," I messed up, Bonnie"
18566,Bonnie, What? How? Where is she?
18567,Damon, Can't believe you've never had one of these before
18568,Rebekah," Well, I've been in a casket for 90 years"
18569,Damon, That's no excuse
18570,Rebekah, Why are you being so nice to me? You hate me. You should be mean
18571,Damon," Well, I could be mean if that's what you're into"
18572,Rebekah, You're distracting me. Why?
18573,Damon, Just trying to be a good housemate
18574,Rebekah," There's no fair fight between us, Damon. Remember that"
18575,Tyler, What the hell? How did I get home?
18576,Caroline, I brought you here. You were being a d-bag
18577,Tyler, What is your problem today?
18578,Caroline, My problem is you've been sired. Do you even know what that means? It means that you put Klaus's needs first. He is your master now
18579,Tyler," I'm not anyone's pet, Caroline. He doesn't control me"
18580,Caroline," Well, something's got to be controlling you. Because I don't know why else you'd be acting like the old you"
18581,Tyler, The old me?
18582,Caroline," Yeah. The old you. The pre-werewolf you. You know, the obnoxious you that I would never be friends with"
18583,Tyler," Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I don't want to be that guy. I hated that guy"
18584,Caroline," You're a vampire now, Tyler. Everything about your personality is heightened. So you have to be careful"
18585,Tyler, I will. I promise. Just...Don't hate me. Everything I like about me is you
18586,Elena, I used to know every constellation. How did I forget them all?
18587,Stefan, You're drunk. You need to go home
18588,Elena, Fine. Unh. Let me find my car
18589,Stefan," You're joking, right?"
18590,Elena, Uh-oh. It's the fun police. I thought that ripper Stefan was supposed to be the life of the party
18591,Stefan," Well, all right, I'm driving you home. Come on"
18592,Stefan," What are you, 5? Get down"
18593,Elena, Why? Are you afraid that I'm going to
18594,Elena, Oh. Ha. That was close. Klaus would not be happy with you
18595,Stefan, You're hilarious
18596,Elena," Look, Stefan, no hands"
18597,Elena, I knew you'd catch me
18598,Alaric, You ok?
18599,Elena, Yeah. I'm... Fine
18600,Alaric," You look, uh, not sober"
18601,Elena, The plan worked. That's all that matters. Let's just get him out of here
18602,Matt, I'm so sorry. I didn't think she'd do something like this. I trusted her
18603,Bonnie, You need to tell me exactly what you did to let Vicki out. So I know exactly how to send her back
18604,Alaric, I see all the geniuses came out to the bonfire tonight
18605,Alaric, Elena! Elena! Open the door
18606,Elena, I can't! It won't open
18607,Vicki," I'm sorry, Elena"
18608,Bonnie, I found a spell that can block whatever magic is helping Vicki
18609,Matt, What do I do?
18610,Bonnie, Give me your hand
18611,Elena, Stefan!
18612,Vicki, What is she doing?
18613,Matt, Fixing my mistake
18614,Vicki, Make her stop
18615,Matt, Bonnie...
18616,Bonnie, The spell is working Matt. She's still here because of you
18617,Vicki," Matt, please"
18618,Matt," I can't let you hurt anyone, Vicki"
18619,Vicki," I won't. I'll stop. Just, please, don't make me go"
18620,Matt, I have to. This is wrong. You shouldn't be here
18621,Vicki, I'm sorry. I just didn't want to be alone anymore
18622,Matt, Neither did I. But I have to let you go
18623,Matt," Goodbye, Vicki"
18624,Matt, She's gone
18625,Alaric, Hurry up before it blows
18626,Elena," Wait! Wait, wait, wait!"
18627,Elena, Give it to me. I can do it
18628,Damon," No, let me"
18629,Elena," Damon, come on"
18630,Damon," Elena, you almost got barbecued. The least I can do is apply first aid"
18631,Elena, You played your part of the plan really well tonight
18632,Damon," Oh, yeah?"
18633,Elena, You had Rebekah drooling all over you and your marshmallows
18634,Damon," Yeah, before she skewered me. I thought you were too drunk to notice"
18635,Elena, I was faking most of it
18636,Damon, So was I
18637,Alaric," Ready to get going, Elena?"
18638,Damon," Great work tonight, Ric. Sorry about the car, man. Bummer"
18639,Tyler, You're always running out on me
18640,Caroline, You have to earn the overnighter
18641,Tyler, I consider that a challenge
18642,Caroline, Bye
18643,Tyler, Bye
18644,Tyler, What are you doing here?
18645,Rebekah, I have something for you
18646,Tyler, What?
18647,Rebekah, A little present
18648,Tyler, You should go
18649,Rebekah, You sure? I think my brother would want his hybrid to indulge in everything life has to offer
18650,Mikael, I apologize for my outburst. It would have made more sense had you known that I've been denying myself human bl*od for as long as I can remember. Why is it that you awoke me?
18651,Katherine, I thought you might know how to k*ll Klaus. But something tells me that I've been sorely misinformed
18652,Mikael, Would you mind helping me with these? I can assure you there's no way I can k*ll Klaus from beneath them
18653,Katherine, Does that you mean you do know how to k*ll him?
18654,Mikael, I can k*ll Klaus. And I will
18655,Mikael, Thank you
18656,Katherine, A little bl*od will grease those muscles up real quick. Just saying...
18657,Mikael, I don't feed on living things
18658,Katherine, Then what do you eat?
18659,Elena, It's ok if you want to be friends with Damon again
18660,Alaric, I don't
18661,Elena, I think he kind of misses you
18662,Stefan, Well you got me tonight. Definitely wasn't expecting that
18663,Alaric, That was the point
18664,Stefan," Yeah. You know, you can hate it all you want, but Elena needs me. I'll always protect her. I think you're both better off having me around"
18665,Stefan," Elena, wait. You could have let me die in that fire tonight. Why didn't you?"
18666,Elena, Because I still have hope
18667,Stefan," After everything I've done, you... You still think I'll be able to find my humanity again"
18668,Elena," Yes, I do. I know who you really are better than anyone, Stefan. And I'm not giving up"
18669,Stefan," Elena, do you have any idea how pathetic that makes you?"
18670,(Elena," No, Stefan, it makes me strong"
18671,Jeremy," Bonnie, come on. Stop dodging my calls. Don't you think we should at least talk about this?"
18672,Anna, I shouldn't be here
18673,Jeremy, No kidding
18674,Anna," No, I mean, I shouldn't be here, Jeremy. Why are you thinking about me when you're calling her?"
18675,Jeremy," I didn't think I was. Look, I don't know. Ok. I don't know what I'm doing, Anna. The problem is I don't think I can stop thinking about you"
18676,Anna," I can't stop thinking about you, either"
18677,Jeremy, What are we going to do?
18678,Jeremy, Do you...Feel this?
18679,Anna, What's going on? I can feel you. How can I feel you?
18680,Damon," Keep it up, Stefan"
18681,Mason, This is going to be fun
18682,Damon," Low blow, Stefan. Low blow"
18683,Stefan, What the hell happened to you?
18684,Damon," Whatever twisted ripper game this is, leave me out of it"
18685,Stefan, I didn't do this
18686,Damon, Quit screwin' around!
18687,Stefan, I didn't
18688,Stefan," It's pretty messed up though, isn't it?"
18689,Damon, Yep
18690,Damon," Yeah, not to worry. I'll just untangle myself"
18691,Carol," As a long-time member of the historical society, I am especially proud to be kicking off this day of festivities. Thank you, volunteers. Tonight, we turn off our town's lights and flare up our lanterns in honor of the night of illumination started by our founders 150 years ago. Here's founding family member Tobias fell with a history lesson"
18692,Jeremy, What are we doing here?
18693,Alaric, Tobias fell is the head of the history department. I didn't have a choice
18694,Jeremy," All right, that explains what you're doing here"
18695,Alaric," Well, I'm the one who can fail you if you don't help me out"
18696,Elena," Hey, sorry I'm late. What did I miss?"
18697,Anna, Just a bunch of historical lies
18698,Jeremy, You didn't miss anything
18699,Tobias, The first illumination was held in celebration with the new found prosperity that Mystic Falls enjoyed after the w*r
18700,Anna, After the founders stole from all the vampires
18701,Elena, What's so funny?
18702,Anna, Safe from the vampires
18703,Caroline," So when you did the spell to send Vicki away, did that get rid of Anna, too?"
18704,Bonnie," I wish. All I did was block the magic that was helping Vicki get a physical foothold here. Jeremy's still got a direct line to the other side, and as long as he wants to see Anna and she wants to see him, she's still here"
18705,Caroline," Ok, you don't think I can actually resist commenting on that"
18706,Bonnie, There. You commented
18707,Caroline, Bonnie...
18708,Bonnie," What do you want me to say, Caroline? I went against the balance of nature when I brought Jeremy back to life, and now I'm paying the consequences"
18709,Caroline," Well, I want you to say you're not ok with it"
18710,Bonnie, I'm a thousand times not ok with it. I just don't know what to do about it
18711,Damon," Greetings, blondie. Witchy. I think you got your voodoo wires all crossed when you got rid of Vicki Donovan"
18712,Bonnie," What do you mean, why?"
18713,Damon, Because I'm pretty sure I just got spit-roasted by Mason Lockwood's ghost
18714,Bonnie, What?
18715,Caroline, And why would you think that?
18716,Damon, Maybe because he chained me to a chair and shoved a hot poker in my chest. Let's just say I'm having déjà vu
18717,Caroline, I thought you said that ghosts couldn't physically interact with people
18718,Bonnie, They can't
18719,Damon," Yeah, well, I don't have time for a vengeful Lockwood. When I k*ll someone, they're supposed to stay dead. Whatever you screwed up, fix it"
18720,Elena," Hey, Jer, I need you to help me with something"
18721,Jeremy, What's up?
18722,Elena," I've been going through Stefan's old journals. Every single time that he's gone off the rails in the past, his best friend Lexi's been the one to bring him back"
18723,Alaric, So where is she now that we need her?
18724,Jeremy, She's dead
18725,Jeremy," And you want me to try to reach her, don't you?"
18726,Elena," I thought if I knew how she did it, maybe I could help him"
18727,Jeremy, I don't even know if she's on the other side
18728,Elena, Is that what it's called?
18729,Jeremy, That's what Anna calls it. There's not like an official brochure or anything
18730,Alaric," So what is it, like some sort of supernatural purgatory?"
18731,Jeremy," Well, Anna said it's like being here with all of us, only we can't see her or hear her. And she can't interact with anyone. She's all alone"
18732,Alaric, Vicki could interact. She blew up my car
18733,Jeremy, Vicki had help from a witch on the other side. Anna...She's doing this all by herself
18734,Alaric," I'm just saying, maybe we learned our lesson about summoning dead people"
18735,Matt," I haven't seen Vicki, I swear. I sent her back like you told me to"
18736,Bonnie, Are you sure? Because she has just as much reason to haunt Damon as Mason Lockwood does
18737,Matt," She's gone, Bonnie. If she was here, I'd know it. "
18738,Caroline, Why do you think it's Vicki and not Mason?
18739,Bonnie," Because if any ghost other than Vicki Donovan has a physical foothold on our side, then that means Damon's right and something has gone really, really wrong"
18740,Matt, I've had enough of this ghost stuff to last forever. So you guys can leave me out of this one
18741,Caroline, I feel so sad for him. It took a lot for him to send his sister away
18742,Bonnie, Yeah
18743,Caroline, So much strength as a man
18744,Bonnie," I've got a ghost problem to deal with, Caroline. Save the Jeremy lecture for later"
18745,Caroline," Ok, did your grimoire just..."
18746,Bonnie, I think so
18747,Caroline," Ok, please tell me that's a recipe for witch cookies"
18748,Bonnie, It's a manifestation spell. It's used to reveal veiled matter
18749,Caroline, What's veiled matter?
18750,Bonnie, Ghosts
18751,Elena, Do you think it's even possible to contact Lexi?
18752,Jeremy, I don't know. I didn't have an emotional connection with her. I never even met her
18753,Alaric," Can we just drop it, please?"
18754,Elena," No, I can't drop it, Ric. I don't know what else to do"
18755,Alaric, Don't you think we have a few too many dead vampires in our past to be sitting here thinking of them watching us?
18756,Anna, I don't think all supernatural spirits go to the other side. I think some of them find peace
18757,Elena, Is Anna here right now?
18758,Anna, Don't tell her I'm here. She won't like it
18759,Jeremy," No, no. I'm going to go, uh, check my work schedule"
18760,Stefan," Hey, guys. Who forgot to invite me to the family summit?"
18761,Stefan, Hmm? Wow. All these words. I forgot how much I used to care
18762,Elena, I didn't
18763,Stefan," You know, Elena, it's probably best you not torture yourself with memories from the past. It's best we both just move on and accept things as they are."
18764,Alaric," You don't have to be here, Stefan"
18765,Stefan," You know what, Alaric, you're right. I don't. But Elena's here, and I look out for Elena. Besides, there's going to be people everywhere tonight. So there's going to be lots to eat"
18766,Stefan," I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Loosen up"
18767,Elena," I can't drop it, Ric"
18768,Caroline, So this is where you brought Jeremy back to life
18769,Bonnie," Yeah. Sorry, I know it's creepy, but we needed a private place around here to do the spell"
18770,Caroline," Hmm. There's no chance it's haunted by the hundred dead witches who were horrifically b*rned to death in this very spot, is there?"
18771,Bonnie, They're not here anymore. And they made it clear they were never coming back
18772,Caroline, Right. A pinkie swear?
18773,Anna, What's wrong?
18774,Jeremy, Why did you tell me to lie?
18775,Anna, Elena is Bonnie's best friend. She won't like what's going on between us
18776,Jeremy," What is going on between us? Ok, how are we able to touch? Vicki had to use magic to do that"
18777,Anna," I don't know. Honestly, I have no idea"
18778,Jeremy," This witch on the other side that gave Vicki her foothold, is she helping you now?"
18779,Anna," What? No! I'm all alone, Jeremy, I told you that"
18780,Jeremy, Swear to me
18781,Anna," I swear. I'm not any danger to you or anybody, I promise. Hey. I need you to believe me"
18782,Jeremy, I shouldn't even be talking to you. This is not ok
18783,Anna," Then send me away. I'm only here because you want to be with me as much as I want to be with you. Send me away, Jeremy. It's that easy"
18784,Jeremy, I don't know why this is happening or when it's going to stop. But before it's done... I have to do this
18785,Caroline, Ready? Do you need me to do...
18786,Caroline, Right. Ok
18787,Alaric, I'll grab Jeremy
18788,Elena, I'll be right back
18789,Alaric," You know, I've had enough vampires today, thanks"
18790,Damon," Oh, come on. Have a drink with me. We've got trouble"
18791,Alaric," No, you've got trouble. See, we're not a team. You tried to k*ll me. All right? We're not friends. I don't like you anymore"
18792,Damon, Ah! But remember back when you liked me and we conspired to k*ll Uncle werewolf Mason Lockwood?
18793,Alaric," Yeah, and?"
18794,Damon, I think he's still a little pissed
18795,Caroline," Bonnie, I don't like this. Bonnie..."
18796,Caroline," Oh, my God. Is that your..."
18797,Bonnie, Grams
18798,Elena, Anna?
18799,Stefan, Lexi!
18800,Alaric, Mason
18801,Mason," God, I miss whisky"
18802,Damon, Told ya
18803,Lexi, Hi
18804,Stefan, You're dead
18805,Lexi," Well, technically, so are you"
18806,Stefan, Then how the hell can I see...
18807,Lexi," See me? Yeah, I have no idea. And I have no idea how long it's going to last, so let's get right"
18808,Stefan," Look, I don't know how you're here, but you need to leave me alone, ok?"
18809,Lexi, Now what kind of a friend would I be if I didn't help you out of this mess you're in?
18810,Stefan, I don't want your help
18811,Lexi," You know, you say that every time. ""I don't want your help, I don't want to get better, leave me alone."""
18812,Stefan," Well, maybe you should listen this time"
18813,Lexi, Or maybe I should do this
18814,Bonnie, I can't believe you're here!
18815,Sheila," Now stop your crying, we don't have time for tears"
18816,Sheila," Nice to see you again, Caroline"
18817,Caroline," Hi, miss Sheila"
18818,Sheila," A fine mess you've made, honey. The witches told you there'd be consequences to bringing Jeremy back and you did it anyway"
18819,Bonnie, I didn't have a choice. I love him and I... I couldn't just let him go
18820,Sheila," I understand. But you cracked open the door to the other side. There's an old witch over here. She took advantage of it. She took advantage of you, honey. When you did that spell to send Vicki Donovan away, she wedged the door wide open. Giving a free pass to anybody with unfinished business"
18821,Bonnie, How do you know this?
18822,Sheila, Witches talk. Even on the other side. Who do you think makes all the rules?
18823,Bonnie, What does the witch want?
18824,Sheila," That's original vampire business, not yours. I don't want you getting in the middle of that. I'm here because you upset the balance of nature. And it's your duty to set it right. You need to close that door"
18825,Elena, How do we do that?
18826,Caroline, Apparently the old witch can draw power from this side because of her talisman
18827,Elena, Talisman... My necklace?
18828,Caroline," It's some ju ju power source. And I know you're not going to like this, but Bonnie needs to destroy it"
18829,Elena, I just walked in on Jeremy kissing the reason I'm completely ok with that
18830,Caroline, What?! Are you kidding?
18831,Elena," I wish. Look, I don't have the necklace. Damon has it somewhere. Text him. I'll call you right back"
18832,Jeremy, Elena…
18833,Elena, You need to disappear or evaporate or whatever it is that you ghosts do
18834,Jeremy," Hey, it's not her fault"
18835,Elena," You're right, it's yours."
18836,Elena, How did this happen?
18837,Jeremy," I don't know. Ok? I don't know. It just... it did. Elena, please. You can't tell Bonnie"
18838,Elena, Don't worry. I'm going to let you do that. Right after I help her send the ghosts away
18839,Lexi," Looks like today was a good day to be thinking about me, Elena"
18840,Elena, Lexi?
18841,Lexi, Mm-hmm. Come with me
18842,Elena, Where?
18843,Lexi, Ripper detox 101. Crash course
18844,Elena, I…
18845,Lexi," I'm sorry, did you not just say how desperate you were for my help in saving Stefan's life?"
18846,Elena, Let's go
18847,Damon, I am never going to hear the end of that damn necklace
18848,Mason," One of you will pay for this, right? Cheers"
18849,Damon, Let's get to it. I k*ll you. You want revenge. Get in line
18850,Mason," Actually, I want an apology"
18851,Alaric, Good luck with that
18852,Damon, Don't you have a family to haunt? You know your nephew has turned into a mindless hybrid Minion
18853,Mason, That's why I'm here. To help Tyler
18854,Damon," Well, sorry to break it to you, buddy, but Tyler can't be helped. At least not while Klaus is alive. Which is, like, always"
18855,Mason, Not necessarily. Not if you found a w*apon that could k*ll him
18856,Damon, There is no w*apon that... What do you know?
18857,Mason, I know you need to apologize
18858,Damon, You got to be kidding me
18859,Alaric, Are you incapable of remorse? Just apologize!
18860,Damon, You're right. I didn't have to k*ll you. I do a lot of things I don't have to do
18861,Mason, That's good enough
18862,Mason, Meet me at the old Lockwood cellar. Bring a shovel. And come alone
18863,Damon," What, you're going to bury me alive?"
18864,Mason, Don't tempt me
18865,Lexi," Klaus really did a number on him, huh?"
18866,Elena, He compelled him to turn off his humanity
18867,Lexi," Well, we're just going to have to convince him to turn it back on. I have to warn you, it's not going to be pretty"
18868,Elena, I can handle it
18869,Lexi," Wake up, sleepyhead"
18870,Lexi, How you feelin'?
18871,Stefan, What is this? Let me out of here!
18872,Lexi," Shh. Inside voices, please. I'm trying to get inside your head"
18873,Stefan," Elena. Get rid of her, please"
18874,Elena, No
18875,Lexi," First step, drying him out. Starve away the bl*od lust. Strip away the temptation"
18876,Stefan," This isn't going to work, Lexi. You can't do this"
18877,Lexi, You heard the not pretty part?
18878,Elena, I heard you
18879,Stefan, What are you doing?
18880,Stefan," What are you doing, Lexi?!"
18881,Lexi," Doing what I do best, sweetness. I'm saving your life"
18882,Mason, I'm surprised you showed
18883,Damon, You put a snag in my only other Klaus lead. So I'd say I'm highly motivated
18884,Mason," Mikael? Yeah. That didn't turn out so great, did it?"
18885,Damon, How do you know so much?
18886,Mason, There's not much to do on the other side but sit around and watch other people screw things up
18887,Damon, What are we looking for?
18888,Mason," There's an old Lockwood family legend about a w*apon that can k*ll an original vampire. Like the rest of their secrets, they kept it buried"
18889,Damon," Oh, come on, give me the thing. Move"
18890,Mason, Go for it.
18891,Damon, You first
18892,Damon, The thought crossed my mind
18893,Stefan, I'm starving. I'm starving. I'm starving! Let me out! Let me out. Please let me out
18894,Elena, What's happening?
18895,Lexi, He's hallucinating. That's three months without any bl*od
18896,Stefan, Let me out!
18897,Lexi, Now he's at nine months
18898,Lexi, Two years... Five
18899,Stefan, Did I ever tell you how glad I am that you're dead?
18900,Lexi," Oh. I missed you, too, friend"
18901,Elena, Hello?
18902,Caroline, So the necklace isn't where Damon said it would be and now we can't reach Damon
18903,Elena," Listen, I need you to get Bonnie to hold off on sending the ghosts back"
18904,Caroline, What?! But you said you were in full support of getting rid of them
18905,Elena," I was. I am. Look, Lexi's here and she's helping with Stefan"
18906,Caroline," Ok, let's just find it first and then we'll choose between boyfriend ghost dramas"
18907,Bonnie, What are you talking about?
18908,Caroline," Um...Lexi's back, so Elena wants us to hold off on destroying the necklace"
18909,Bonnie," You said boyfriend dramas. Plural. What is it, Caroline?"
18910,Caroline, Elena caught Jeremy kissing Anna
18911,Bonnie, What?
18912,Caroline, I'm sorry
18913,Bonnie, He kissed her?
18914,Caroline," She's got a foothold now, so she probably thinks that she's here to stay. But you and I, Bonnie, we're going to find that necklace. Ok?"
18915,Bonnie, Okay
18916,Jeremy, Anna! Anna!
18917,Jeremy," Sorry. Hey, man sorry about that"
18918,Frederick," No problem, buddy"
18919,Carol, Have you seen Tobias Fell? He's supposed to do the lighting ceremony
18920,Alaric, No
18921,Frederick," Well, well"
18922,Anna, Frederick?
18923,Frederick, If it isn't pearl's daughter. Little Annabelle
18924,Carol," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Fell seems to have been detained, so the history department's very own Mr. Saltzman has agreed to fill in"
18925,Frederick," Still hanging around the Gilbert kid, huh? I guess you forgot the fact that his family k*ll you and your mother"
18926,Jeremy, There you are. Is everything all right?
18927,Frederick, Ask your ancestors
18928,Anna," What are you doing here, Frederick?"
18929,Frederick," Well, it's a founder's celebration. And we..."
18930,Frederick, Have got some unfinished business with the founding families
18931,Alaric," On behalf of Mystic Falls high school historical society, let's light 'em up"
18932,Stefan," Elena, Elena. I'm hurting. Please help me"
18933,Lexi, Don't listen. Shut him out
18934,Elena," I am helping you, Stefan"
18935,Stefan, I'll do anything. I'll change. I promise
18936,Lexi, It's a lie. He'll say anything right now
18937,Stefan," Elena, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just make it stop. Please, just make it stop"
18938,Lexi, You have to separate yourself from your emotions. Don't let him play with them
18939,Stefan," Hey, look at me. Look at me"
18940,Stefan," Elena. I love you, ok? I love you. I love you so much. I love you so much, Elena"
18941,Elena," I'm sorry, Stefan, I just don't believe you"
18942,Stefan," You know what? I don't want your help, anyway. I wish I'd never met you. Every single moment that I've spent with you has been a complete and total waste"
18943,Lexi," You see that? That's the ripper talking. Once he's weak enough, you have to cause him pain. Make him feel things. Anger, rage, anything. You have to make him see past the bl*od."
18944,Lexi, Think of it as a regimen. Day in and day out. Like running the treadmill. Like making coffee. Until he's ready to be saved
18945,Stefan," I will rip you apart, Lexi!"
18946,Lexi, You can't. I'm already dead
18947,Elena, I can't...
18948,Caroline, Ugh! I give up. It's not anywhere in this room
18949,Caroline," What do you want, Jeremy?"
18950,Jeremy, Caroline? Did you find that necklace?
18951,Caroline," Not yet. Wait, what's going on?"
18952,Jeremy, Ghosts of the tomb vampires k*ll Tobias Fell. You might want to find that necklace before they start going alphabetically through the founding families
18953,Caroline," Well, it's not where it's supposed to be. Unless someone took it"
18954,Jeremy, Who?
18955,Caroline," Well, who do you think?"
18956,Anna, I didn't 
18957,Jeremy, She said she didn't take it
18958,Caroline," Oh, and you believe her"
18959,Anna," I didn't take it, Jeremy"
18960,Jeremy," You know what, yeah, yeah, I do believe her "
18961,Caroline," You know what, you're an even bigger idiot than I thought. So wake up, Jeremy, before you lose everything"
18962,Elena, Jeremy? What happened?
18963,Damon, I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Your motives are deceptively pure
18964,Mason," You talk the talk, but I know you'll do anything for your brother. You won't screw me over as long as we have the same agenda"
18965,Damon, I'm supposed to believe you're not going to screw me over?
18966,Damon, All right. Which way?
18967,Mason, I don't know. Flip a coin
18968,Damon, Aren't you supposed to be all-knowing?
18969,Mason, I'm a ghost. I'm not God. Go left
18970,Damon, Or not 
18971,Mason, You have trust issues. Anyone ever tell you that?
18972,Damon, Yo. Help a brother out? Mason?
18973,Elena, Where is Anna now?
18974,Jeremy," I don't know, ok? I don't even know for sure if she took the necklace"
18975,Elena, She was the only person who heard us talking about it. Of course she took it. Ok? We have to get it back. We have to destroy it and then close the door
18976,Jeremy," I know, but..."
18977,Elena," But what? What, Jer?"
18978,Jeremy," I can touch her, Elena. I can kiss her again. And I know it's wrong, and I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but I do. I love her. I've always loved her"
18979,Elena," But it's not real. She's dead. Gone. Everything that you're hold on to is in the past, Jer. Are you going to love a ghost for the rest of your life?"
18980,Elena," He's at the beginning of his life, Anna. You're just holding him back. You know that"
18981,Elena, Call Bonnie. Tell her that you have the necklace. Get her to send the ghosts away
18982,Damon," Oh, I'm having a bad day"
18983,Mason, Sorry. Thought you might need this
18984,Mason, You're welcome
18985,Damon," What's your game, man? I k*ll you. I jammed my fist into your chest. I ripped your heart out. There's no way this whole buddy-trust act is real"
18986,Mason," You know what the other side is like? We're all alone. We watch the people we left behind and we regret our decisions. That's it. Look, I can't change what happened to me. But maybe I can change what happens to Tyler. I don't need revenge, Damon. I need redemption"
18987,Caroline, Jeremy's got the necklace. He's going to meet us at the witch house
18988,Bonnie, Ok. What's going on up there?
18989,Caroline, It's Mrs. Lockwood's car
18990,Caroline, Bonnie? I'm going to get out of the car
18991,Bonnie, What?!
18992,Caroline, And you're going to drive the hell away from here
18993,Bonnie, No way! I am not leaving you!
18994,Caroline," Bonnie, you've got your ghost boyfriend drama. Elena has hers. And right now the mother of mine is about to be ghost bait. So go and send them all back to the other side, ok?"
18995,Jeremy," This spell is just going to break your foothold, right? You'll still be here, I'll still be able to see you. This... this doesn't have to be good-bye"
18996,Anna, No. But it should be. Elena was right. I'm holding you back
18997,Jeremy, Anna…
18998,Anna, I'm sorry I took the necklace
18999,Anna," with all the tomb vampires out, that maybe..."
19000,Jeremy, You might find your mother
19001,Anna," I don't know where she is, Jeremy. I don't know if she's moved on and found peace, or if there's even any peace to be found"
19002,Jeremy," Hey, there is, Anna. Ok, there has to be. I believe that, ok?"
19003,Anna, I just... I don't want to be alone anymore
19004,Jeremy, You're not going to be alone. I'm not going to let you be alone
19005,Lexi," Quit fighting me, Stefan. I know you're in there"
19006,Stefan," Not anymore, Lexi"
19007,Lexi, You know you say that every time. Until I make you feel again
19008,Stefan, You wasted your whole life taking care of me. Now you're dead and you still have nothing better to do
19009,Elena, We're running out of time
19010,Lexi, You've got to get me more
19011,Elena, I can't
19012,Lexi, No! No... not until I break through
19013,Elena," I can't, Lexi. They have a necklace. They're going to close the door"
19014,Lexi," The necklace. Ok. That necklace. At least tell me you remember how you felt about that. You found it during your darkest time. And you said, when you made it through, that that necklace represented hope"
19015,Stefan," Ironic, then, that it's about to be blown to pieces"
19016,Damon, God! This is not happening
19017,Mason, What now?
19018,Damon, I can't get through. It's like I'm not invited in. Wait!
19019,Mason, I'm not stopping just 'cause you're stuck. I'll let you know what I find
19020,Damon," Yeah, but..."
19021,Mason, Looks like you're gonna have to trust me
19022,Jeremy, Bonnie!
19023,Damon, So? What'd you find?
19024,Mason, It's in...
19025,Damon," No, no, no, no. No, where'd you go? Mason, Mason!"
19026,Lexi," He's still in there, Elena. You just have to break through"
19027,Elena," It's ok, Lexi, I know what to do now. You can be free"
19028,Anna, Mama?
19029,Sheila, You are stronger than all of this. I'm so proud of you
19030,Damon, You're here. It's about time
19031,Alaric, Didn't have anyone else to call?
19032,Damon," No, actually, I don't. 'Cause I need a non-vampire to get in the cave, and other than Elena, you're pretty much the only one I trust"
19033,Alaric," Well, you have a crappy way of showing that"
19034,Damon," Look, if Mason Lockwood can get over the fact that I k*ll him, can't you cut me a little slack, Ric?"
19035,Alaric," I shouldn't have to get over it. I was your friend, Damon. You shouldn't have done it in the first place"
19036,Damon, Well! Sometimes... I do things I don't have to do
19037,Alaric, You're going to recycle that same crap ass apology you gave Mason Lockwood?
19038,Damon, Yeah. Well... I didn't mean it with him
19039,Stefan," So what are you going to do, Elena? You just going to stand there? Waiting for me to dry out?"
19040,Elena," No, I'm going to go home, take care of my brother. Be a friend to Bonnie and everything else that I have to do"
19041,Stefan," That's good for you. You know, I was wondering when you were going to give up. Lexi gave you... enough of a glimpse into your tragic future"
19042,Elena," I haven't given up, Stefan. I still have hope. But there's nothing that I can do until you get yours back."
19043,Elena," Hey. You can break through this. Fight for it. Feel something. Anything, Stefan. Because if you don't, you're going to lose me forever. I won't love a ghost for the rest of my life"
19044,Jeremy, Bonnie...
19045,Bonnie," Just go away, Jeremy"
19046,Jeremy, I owe you an explanation
19047,Bonnie," Matt let go of a sister before you let go of Anna. His sister, Jeremy. You know what you owe me? The respect of not making me listen to you explain yourself"
19048,Jeremy," I am sorry, Bonnie"
19049,Bonnie, You need to go
19050,Jeremy, But…
19051,Bonnie," Just go, Jeremy"
19052,Damon," So was Mason screwing with me, or is there something in there?"
19053,Damon, Ric. Ric
19054,Alaric, I found something
19055,Damon, What is it?
19056,Alaric, I have no idea
19057,Elena, So the Lockwood's really have no idea that these tunnels are underneath their property?
19058,Alaric, Yeah. Careful where you shine that thing. Bats hate the light
19059,Elena, Wait. What?
19060,Alaric, Elena
19061,Damon, Boo!
19062,Elena," God, Damon"
19063,Damon, Scaredy-cat
19064,Alaric, Just ignore him. That's what I do
19065,Elena, So you really can't get in?
19066,Damon, No. Seems even the ancient Lockwood's were anti-vampire
19067,Elena, What do you mean ancient?
19068,Damon, See for yourself. This is as far as I get to go)
19069,Elena, What is all this?
19070,Alaric," Well, as far as I can tell, it's a story. In simple archaeological terms, it's a really, really old story"
19071,Alaric, That right there is a moon cycle. A man. A wolf. A werewolf
19072,Damon," Yeah. It's the Lockwood diaries, Pictionary style"
19073,Elena, I don't understand. I thought the Lockwood's came here with the original founders in the 1860s
19074,Alaric," Ah, maybe the Lockwood's did, but according to this wall, these werewolves have been here a lot longer than that"
19075,Elena, How long?
19076,Damon," Long. Gets better. Show her, Ric"
19077,Alaric," Names, and they're not native. They're written in runic, a Viking script"
19078,Elena, Viking?
19079,Alaric," This name here, when translated, it reads... Niklaus"
19080,Elena, Klaus
19081,Alaric, And Elijah... And Rebekah
19082,Klaus, Rebekah let me have at it
19083,Rebekah," Quiet, Niklaus. I have to have my concentration if I'm not to slice off a finger"
19084,Klaus, Father will not like you handling the blade
19085,Rebekah," If I want to wield a blade, I shall wield a blade. Father need not know"
19086,Klaus, He will find out. He always does
19087,Rebekah, That is because you always tell him
19088,Klaus, I cannot help it. He frightens me
19089,Rebekah," He frightens us all. That is why we stick together as one, always and forever. Right, traitor?"
19090,Klaus, Right
19091,Rebekah, Here. You finish. I'm to help mother with the meal
19092,Klaus," Yes. Go tend to dinner. Leave the blades to the men, little sister"
19093,Klaus, Ahh. Bekka
19094,Rebekah, It's just a little bl*od. Be a man about it
19095,Elena, These are the names of the original family?
19096,Alaric," Carved into a cave that's… That's been here since way before the founding of Mystic Falls or even the entire new world, for that matter"
19097,Elena," Ok, this has gotta be one of Klaus' fakes"
19098,Damon, That's what I said
19099,Alaric," That could be true, except the last name up here made us think otherwise"
19100,Elena, What's the name?
19101,Alaric, Mikael
19102,Elena," Mikael? Mikael, as in the vampire hunter who knows how to k*ll Klaus?"
19103,Damon, Yep. And I now like to call him papa original
19104,Alaric," These images tell a story to learn the story, I have to decipher these images"
19105,Damon, Sloppy
19106,Elena, Shut up. I'm new at this
19107,Damon," The ghost of Christmas past, Mason Lockwood, said that the cave would lead us to a w*apon that could k*ll Klaus"
19108,Elena," Yeah, but doesn't Mikael have a w*apon?"
19109,Damon," Yes, which probably means the wall will lead us to Mikael, who we've already found and lost"
19110,Damon, Bang. You're dead
19111,Alaric," These images, at the very least, might tell us what that w*apon is"
19112,Elena, Then all we have to do is find out what they mean
19113,Damon," Well, fine. Fine. If I'm being irritatingly optimistic like you two. How do you suppose we do that?"
19114,Elena," Well, if the story's about the original family living here, then we go straight to the source"
19115,Rebekah, You. Goody
19116,Elena, I was hoping we could talk
19117,Rebekah," About what? Stefan? Don't worry. I'm off him until he starts treating me better. In fact, you should probably take a page out of my book, if I'm being honest"
19118,Elena," Actually, I'd rather talk about this"
19119,Elena, I'm curious why you and Klaus have spent a thousand years running from your father
19120,Rebekah, I should get back to the girls. Homecoming's right around the corner
19121,Elena," Well, then maybe I'll ask Mikael when we wake him"
19122,Rebekah, You're bluffing. You don't know where he is. No one does
19123,Elena, So then who's rotting in that old cemetery in Charlotte?
19124,Rebekah," If you wake Mikael, we are all doomed"
19125,Elena, So then tell me
19126,Rebekah, Why do you want to know?
19127,Elena, Why don't you want me to wake him?
19128,Rebekah, I need to get back to the girls
19129,Rebekah," Come on, Henrik. Our brothers are fighting again"
19130,Elijah," Oh, look. Sister's arrived to watch my fast-approaching victory"
19131,Klaus," On the contrary, Elijah"
19132,Esther," Relax, Mikael. Niklaus means well"
19133,Mikael, That is precisely my problem
19134,Mikael," So... Why don't you teach me that trick, young warrior?"
19135,Klaus," Father, we were just having fun"
19136,Mikael, We fight for our survival. And you find time for fun?! I want to have fun! Teach me. Come on!
19137,Klaus," Father, it was nothing"
19138,Mikael," You are foolish and impulsive, my boy. What? No more laughter?"
19139,Esther," You've made your point, Mikael"
19140,Mikael," Some days, it's a miracle you're still alive... Boy"
19141,Elena," She's going to tell me. She's scared of him, Damon. I saw her face. I just have to engage in a little mean-girl power struggle first"
19142,Damon, Make sure she doesn't power struggle you into a wheelchair
19143,Elena," I've got this, Damon. If we can figure out a way to k*ll Klaus, Stefan will be free of his compulsion. So how does he look?"
19144,Damon, Mmm. Pasty and pouty
19145,Elena, He'll have to get over it. Call me later
19146,Elena, Rebekah will come around
19147,Alaric," You sure about that? I mean, a thousand-year-old vampire, I'm sure, has learned the art of patience"
19148,Elena," She's a thousand-year-old vampire who's joined the cheerleading squad. There's a whole different set of rules in play here, Ric. I've got this"
19149,Stefan," You know, if you two are gonna keep me locked in here for the next decade, I think we can skip the routine visits"
19150,Damon," You know I'm not a big champion of this whole Lexi recovery plan. But Elena thinks this place is gonna... Weaken you out, break you down, and make you feel again"
19151,Stefan," We should all listen to Elena, right? I mean, her plans always work out so well, don't they? Why are you here? "
19152,Damon, What are you talking about? It's family day at vampire rehab. Just paying a visit to my baby brother
19153,Stefan, Go away
19154,Damon," Nah. Nah, I thought we could hang out. Little brother bonding. How you been, Stef? Huh?"
19155,Stefan," You know, Klaus may want to keep Elena alive, but that doesn't mean she's safe with Rebekah"
19156,Damon," Liar, liar, pants on fire, brother. Klaus compelled you to protect Elena, and if you thought for even a second that she was in danger, you'd be working a lot harder"
19157,Stefan, You got me
19158,Damon, Yep
19159,Stefan, You got me. You're good. Congratulations. You can go now
19160,Damon, You really have given up
19161,Stefan," Actually, this is my happy face"
19162,Stefan, What are you doing?
19163,Damon, Screw this Lexi plan. I think we could both use a drink
19164,Rebekah," Hey, what's up?"
19165,Elena, You invited me over to talk
19166,Rebekah," All right, girls. Have at it"
19167,Rebekah," Okay, now twirl, please"
19168,Elena, You've compelled your own private runway show?
19169,Rebekah, I need a homecoming dress. So what do you think? Pick one
19170,Elena, Heh. I'm not here to help you shop. I'm here to talk about why you don't want me to wake up Mikael
19171,Rebekah," I said pick one, Elena"
19172,Elena, The red one!
19173,Rebekah," There. That wasn't so hard, was it?"
19174,Rebekah, Go away. Remember nothing
19175,Rebekah, You do not threaten me. You will learn what I allow you to learn. Is that clear?
19176,Bonnie, Hey there
19177,Alaric, Bonnie. Come on in
19178,Bonnie, Got your message
19179,Alaric," Yeah, great. Uh... I'm sorry the place is such a mess. I'm obsessed"
19180,Bonnie, Brought you the necklace that wouldn't die
19181,Alaric, That's great. Are you ok?
19182,Bonnie, Been better
19183,Alaric," Listen, Jeremy is an idiot, and I know this with certainty because I was once a Jeremy. Trust me. We learn eventually"
19184,Alaric," So I've been staring at this image all day, wondering why it looked so familiar..."
19185,Alaric, And I was right.
19186,Bonnie, It's the same design.
19187,Alaric," So your grandmother said this necklace belonged to the witch that put the hybrid curse on Klaus, right? This symbol is repeated all across the wall, and I've been trying to figure out what it meant. Now I know"
19188,Rebekah, How fun is this?
19189,Elena, We shouldn't be here
19190,Rebekah, Of course we should. Come on. Like you've never wanted to snoop
19191,Rebekah," Boxer briefs. Now, that's a change from the twenties"
19192,Elena," Are you gonna root through his stuff all night, or are you gonna start to tell me your story?"
19193,Rebekah, You really are no fun. What do you want to know?
19194,Elena," Well, Elijah said that your father was a landowner in Europe. How did you guys end up here?"
19195,Rebekah, My parents had just started a family when a plague struck their homeland. They lost a child to it. They wanted to escape and protect their future family from the same fate
19196,Elena, So how did you end up here? This part of the world hadn't even been discovered yet
19197,Rebekah," Not by anyone in your history books. But my mother knew the witch Ayana, who heard from the spirits of a mystical land where everyone was healthy... Blessed by the gifts of speed and strength. That led my family here, where we lived amongst those people"
19198,Elena, The werewolves?
19199,Rebekah," To us, they were just our neighbors. My family lived in peace with them for over 20 years, during which time my family had more children, including me"
19200,Elena, You make it sound so normal
19201,Rebekah," It was. Once a month, our family retreated to the caves beneath our village. The wolves would howl through the night, and by morning, we'd return home"
19202,Rebekah," Ayana, you b*rned me"
19203,Ayana, That is not yours to touch
19204,Klaus, Mother!
19205,Rebekah, Is that Niklaus? Something is wrong
19206,Rebekah, Henrik!
19207,Klaus, Mother!
19208,Rebekah," One full moon, Klaus and my youngest brother Henrik snuck out to watch the men turn into beasts. That was forbidden. Henrik paid the price "
19209,Esther," Henrik, no. No. What happened?"
19210,Klaus, The wolves. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry
19211,Esther, We must save him
19212,Esther," Please, there must be a way"
19213,Ayana," The spirits will not give us a way, Esther. Your boy is gone"
19214,Esther," No, no!"
19215,Rebekah, And that was the beginning of the end of peace with our neighbors. And one of the last moments my family had together as humans
19216,Rebekah, You better get that. That'll be Damon checking up on you
19217,Elena," Hello? Damon, where are you?"
19218,Damon," No idea, but I'm pretty sure I'm overdressed. Still standing?"
19219,Elena," Yes. I'm fine, but I can't talk right now"
19220,Elena, Was that Stefan?
19221,Damon," Yeah. I kind of went off-book, but don't worry. I know what I'm doing"
19222,Elena," Damon, how could you let him out?"
19223,Damon," I've got this, Elena"
19224,Damon, What are we drinking?
19225,Stefan," Hopefully something a little bit warmer, a little blonder"
19226,Callie, Hi
19227,Damon," Hello, Callie. I would love a sh*t of your best whiskey, and my brother here would love a sh*t of you"
19228,Stefan," What's the catch, Damon?"
19229,Damon," No catch, brother. Drink up. It's on me"
19230,Damon, Hi Callie
19231,Stefan," Drink up, brother"
19232,Damon," Will you get us another bottle of this, hmm?"
19233,Damon," You been on this bunny diet for the better part of 50 years, so how is it that Saint Stefan, of all people, gets good at a drinking game?"
19234,Stefan," Well, the bunny diet gave me a lot of time to practice. Wallow in despair. Drown in guilt. Regret my existence. It's precision born out of tragic boredom"
19235,Stefan," Drink up, brother"
19236,Damon," All that effort wasted trying to tell you how boring you were, and now you finally agree with me?"
19237,Stefan," Damon, you are worse than Elena. Getting me drunk. Brotherly bonding. What, you think I'll break down, and you can pull me back from the edge? Is that it?"
19238,Damon," I happen to like the edge, Stefan. Your problem is your inability to resist falling over it. You're all or nothing, man. You can't just be. Although... Who am I to judge?"
19239,Damon," Drink up, brother"
19240,Elena, Did you get your fill of snooping yet? Can we get on with the story?
19241,Rebekah," Honestly, I don't get you two as a couple"
19242,Elena, Why would you? You don't know anything about who he really is
19243,Rebekah, I know exactly who he is. He's a vampire. We're a predatory species. We don't have time to care about humans and their silly little lives
19244,Elena, Is that why you did that runway show earlier? Because you don't care about the homecoming dance?
19245,Elena, You know what? I'm just gonna go
19246,Rebekah, You haven't even heard half the story
19247,Elena, And you're not going to tell it. You're just bored and looking for someone to push around. Find someone else to play with. Maybe you can compel yourself a friend
19248,Rebekah, The necklace wasn't Stefan's to give. It belonged to the original witch
19249,Elena, The one who put the hybrid curse on Klaus?
19250,Rebekah, Not just the hybrid curse. She's the one who turned us into vampires
19251,Mikael," Please, Ayana, I implore you. You must call upon the spirits before the next full moon"
19252,Ayana, I will not. It is a crime against nature
19253,Esther," Ayana, we have already lost too much. We cannot lose any more. The spirits can help us find a way to protect our children"
19254,Rebekah, I'm thirsty. Do you want a drink?
19255,Elena, So vampirism was a form of protection?
19256,Rebekah, What else would it be?
19257,Elena, A curse
19258,Rebekah, My parents only saw a way of keeping their children alive
19259,Elena," Yeah, but why stay? If they were so afraid of the werewolves, why not leave?"
19260,Rebekah," Pride. My father didn't want to run anymore. He wanted to fight and be superior to the wolves. Where they could bite, we had to bite harder. Where they had speed, we had to be faster. Agility, strength, senses."
19261,Mikael, Everything could be heightened. Our family could live forever
19262,Ayana," At what cost? This magic you speak of breed's consequence. This is the makings of a plague, Esther. The spirits will turn on you"
19263,Esther," Please, Ayana"
19264,Ayana, I will have no part in it
19265,Mikael," If she will not protect our family... Then it is in your hands alone, my love"
19266,Elena, In her hands? How could she do anything?
19267,Rebekah, Because my mother was also a witch
19268,Elena, What?
19269,Rebekah," The witch of the original family, the original witch"
19270,Rebekah, Where do they keep their best vintage?
19271,Elena," But if your mother was a witch, then..."
19272,Rebekah," Am I? No. A witch is nature's servant. A vampire is an abomination of nature. You can either be one or the other, never both. My mother did this for us. She did not turn"
19273,Elena, How did you turn?
19274,Rebekah," She called upon the sun for life and the ancient white oak tree, one of nature's eternal objects, for immortality. That night, my father offered us wine laced with bl*od. And then he drove his sword through our hearts"
19275,Elena, He k*ll you
19276,Rebekah, And he wasn't delicate about it either
19277,Klaus, Rebekah
19278,Rebekah, bl*od. What happened?
19279,Klaus, It'll be all right. We will be all right
19280,Klaus, What are you doing?
19281,Mikael, We must finish what we started. You have to drink if you want to live
19282,Rebekah, We had to drink more bl*od to complete the ritual
19283,Mikael, Drink!
19284,Mikael, Drink!
19285,Rebekah, It was euphoric. The feeling of power was indescribable. But the witch Ayana was right about
19286,Rebekah, The sun became our enemy. It kept us indoors for weeks
19287,Rebekah, And then my mother found a solution
19288,Rebekah, There were other problems
19289,Rebekah, Neighbors who had opened to their homes to us could now keep us out 
19290,Rebekah, Flowers at the base of the white oak b*rned and prevented compulsion. And the spell decreed that the tree that gave us life could also take it away. So we b*rned it to the ground
19291,Rebekah, But the darkest consequence was something my parents never anticipated... The hunger
19292,Rebekah," bl*od had made us reborn, and it was bl*od that we craved above all else. We could not control it"
19293,Rebekah, And with that... The predatory species was born
19294,Damon, Nothing to see here. Just run along. Okay?
19295,Damon," Hey, hey, hey. Ease up. Ease up. She's giving us her employee discount"
19296,Damon, Now just run along
19297,Stefan," All right, time to fess up. What's the point of the jailbreak?"
19298,Damon," I thought you could use a hug, Stefan"
19299,Stefan," Come on, Damon. You know Elena's gonna hate you for letting me out, and we both know that you care about what she thinks"
19300,Damon, Maybe I wanted to remind you what freedom was like before Klaus took it from you
19301,Stefan," As long as Klaus is alive, I do what he says"
19302,Damon," That's my point, Stefan. You've given up. Now, you can sit around and be his little bitch, or you can get mad enough, and you can do something about it"
19303,Stefan," Damon, he can't be k*ll"
19304,Mikael," Maybe I can help with that. The Salvatore boys, I presume"
19305,Stefan, Mikael
19306,Elena, Why did Mikael start hunting Klaus?
19307,Rebekah," When Nik made his first human k*ll, it triggered his werewolf gene. With that, he became my father's greatest shame"
19308,Elena, Yeah. Elijah told me this part of the story. Your mother had had an affair with one of the werewolf villagers. Klaus wasn't his son
19309,Rebekah," She tried to make it right. She put the hybrid curse on Nik to suppress his werewolf side, and then she turned her back on him, but Mikael's greatest weakness as a human was his pride. As a vampire, that was magnified. He went on a rampage and k*ll half the village. Then he came home and k*ll her"
19310,Elena, Mikael k*ll your mother?
19311,Rebekah," He said she broke his heart so he would break hers. He tore it from her chest as Nik watched. Afterwards, my father took off in a rage, and the rest of my family scattered"
19312,Rebekah, Nik stayed so he could help me bury her. He knew I had to say good-bye to my mother
19313,Rebekah," I know you think she hated you, Niklaus, but she did not. She was just afraid. I'm sorry she turned her back on you. I will never do that"
19314,Elijah, Nor will I
19315,Rebekah, We stick together as one. Always and forever
19316,Elena, Always and forever. Even though he locked you in a coffin for 90 years
19317,Rebekah," We're vampires. Our emotions are heightened. I'm stubborn, Elijah moral, and Nik... Nik has no tolerance for those who disappoint him. Over a thousand years as a family, we've all made that mistake at least once. I've made it several times"
19318,Elena, But you still love him?
19319,Rebekah," He's my brother, and I am immortal. Should I spend an eternity alone instead? You've heard the story. It's time to go. I said leave, Elena. I don't know what you're up to, but I am no longer playing along"
19320,Elena, I'm just looking for one good reason why we shouldn't wake Mikael
19321,Rebekah, And I've given you a thousand. But you will anyway. I know you want him to help you k*ll my brother. I'm not stupid
19322,Elena, It's no secret that I want Klaus dead. He has a hold over Stefan's life and over mine
19323,Rebekah," Do what you need. Wake Mikael at your own peril. But make no mistake. If you come after my brother, I will rip you apart. And I get my temper from my father. Now leave"
19324,Mikael, Has Klaus entered the country?
19325,Stefan, I can't tell you
19326,Mikael, Has he spoken to you since he left?
19327,Stefan, I can't tell you
19328,Mikael, All right. Can you tell me the last time you spoke to Niklaus?
19329,Stefan," I am compelled to do what he says, and he says to keep my damn mouth shut"
19330,Damon, I really hope this game of 20 questions isn't your secret w*apon
19331,Mikael," You see, Damon, I've been a vampire Hunter longer than you've been alive. It's why I found you here. It's why I'm gonna find Niklaus. Well, Klaus has been running for about a thousand years, so if you think you're gonna get a workaround he..."
19332,Mikael," Careful, Stefan. One move, and his heart's gone. Now... Where is Klaus? Come on. What's the trick question, Stefan? One twist and he's dead. Unless you don't care, of course"
19333,Damon, His emotions have been shut off. He can't care
19334,Mikael," Really? His link to Klaus is so strong that... He would let his own brother die? No ideas? Hmm? Think, Stefan"
19335,Mikael," I guess you're right. He's a dead end. And so are you, Damon"
19336,Stefan, Wait. I can bring him back. I can lure Klaus back to Mystic Falls
19337,Mikael," And there is our loophole. Just had to rile him up a bit. Get Klaus back to Mystic Falls, and I will gladly drive a stake through his heart. Fail... I'll drive it through yours"
19338,Alaric," Yeah. Filled in what we could. Got vampire, werewolf, slaughter, mayhem, et cetera, et cetera"
19339,Elena," That's the white oak tree that was used in the spell to create the vampires. Which means that was when they b*rned down the tree, destroying the only way that they could be k*ll"
19340,Alaric," Okay, so tree equals w*apon, sort of, but we already knew that. What we're not sure about is this. We've got the witch symbol and what looks like a bleeding heart. Upside-down figures usually signify death of some kind"
19341,Elena, Mikael k*ll the witch by ripping out her heart. But why is that one connected to the witch's death?
19342,Bonnie, I don't know. We haven't gotten that far
19343,Elena," Oh, my God. Rebekah doesn't know the real story"
19344,Rebekah, I thought I told you to leave twice
19345,Elena, How do you know that Mikael k*ll your mother?
19346,Rebekah, Nik was there. He told me
19347,Elena, He lied to you
19348,Rebekah, And how do you know that?
19349,Elena," The cave where you carved your family's names is covered in symbols, the story of your family..."
19350,Elena," How your parents arrived, how they made peace, the spell that turned them into vampires, and this. This is the symbol for hybrid. It's the combination of the werewolf and the vampire symbol. And this is the one for your mother"
19351,Rebekah, Her necklace
19352,Elena, And this is the story of her death
19353,Elena," The hybrid k*ll the original witch. Not Mikael, Klaus"
19354,Rebekah," No. No, he wouldn't"
19355,Elena," She put the curse on him, made it so that he would be the only one of his kind, and then she rejected him. With the werewolf gene comes aggression and violence. When he turned, all of that was heightened. He k*ll her, Rebekah, and then he made up this entire lie about your father so that he wouldn't lose you"
19356,Rebekah, These mean nothing. They're just stupid drawings. Done by stupid people who had no idea who my family was!
19357,Elena, Then why are you so upset? 
19358,Rebekah, Why are you doing this to me? I've done nothing to you
19359,Elena," Klaus k*ll your mother. He has a hold on you, on me, on everyone. He has for a thousand years. We have to make it stop"
19360,Rebekah, Shut up! Just shut up!
19361,Rebekah, Don't talk anymore! Nothing!
19362,Damon," Well, I give you 10 points for flair"
19363,Stefan, At least now we know where Klaus and Elijah learned their tricks from
19364,Damon," Don't think you had to wait till the last second to have your breakthrough, though"
19365,Stefan," Didn't have a breakthrough, Damon"
19366,Damon," ""Ooh. Ooh, my brother's about to die, and I just had to save his life for the billionth time."" Careful, Stefan. Your humanity's showing"
19367,Stefan," Actually, you know what? You're right, Damon. You're right. You reminded me what my freedom felt like. Ah. And when we k*ll Klaus, I'll be free, free to leave. See, I didn't do this for you, Damon. I did it for myself"
19368,Damon," Sure, Stefan. Whatever you say"
19369,Stefan," Why are you doing this, huh? What do you want from me? Why is everybody trying to save me?"
19370,Damon," Because I have to, Stefan. Because you're in this mess with Klaus because you saved my life, because I owe you. And I can't just leave you in a cell to rot"
19371,Stefan," Aww. Better be careful, brother. Your humanity's showing"
19372,Elena," Damon, seriously?"
19373,Damon, We got Mikael
19374,Elena, What? How?
19375,Damon," No idea. I guess Katherine came through. The plan's in motion. See? Told you I had it. Go ahead. Kick, yell, scream. I'm sure you've been planning your rant all day"
19376,Elena, I'm not gonna yell at you
19377,Damon," Why not? I went behind your back, freed Stefan. And you know what? It backfired. He's an even bigger dick than ever. It's just now he's a dick that's on our side"
19378,Elena, I'm not mad. I'm tired. I just... I want to go to bed
19379,Damon," No, I think Mikael's w*apon is a stake, because he mentioned something about it"
19380,Elena," Well, then they must have carved it from the white oak tree before they b*rned it down"
19381,Damon," So I was right. After all that, the wall led us to Mikael"
19382,Elena," It led us to more than just that. I think I got Rebekah on our side, too"
19383,Damon, Really? What'd you learn from her?
19384,Elena," I learned that she's just a girl, that she lost her mom too young, and she loves blindly and recklessly, even if it consumes her"
19385,Elena," You know, when all is said and done, there's nothing more important than the bond of family"
19386,Damon, You should tell that to my brother
19387,Elena," I'm not mad at you for letting him out, Damon"
19388,Elena, I think that you're gonna be the one to save him from himself. It won't be because he loves me. It'll be because he loves you. Can I tell you the rest tomorrow?
19389,Damon, Sure
19390,Klaus, Portland is fantastic once you can get over all the whiney music and healthy-looking people. It's literally a breeding ground for werewolves
19391,Stefan, Your father's dead
19392,Klaus, What did you say to me?
19393,Stefan," Oh, my mistake. Not your actual father, and not dead. Mikael. Daggered. What do you want me to do with the body?"
19394,Klaus," Well, first, I want you to explain to me exactly what happened"
19395,Stefan," All right, we'll say that Mikael followed Elena in here. He tried to grab her so he could use her as bait"
19396,Elena," And you, what, vervained him?"
19397,Damon," No, we vervained him. The guy's an original. Make it realistic"
19398,Stefan, Ok. Fine. We vervained him and in the process discovered that he had a dagger
19399,Elena, Which he planned to use on Rebekah. But instead...
19400,Stefan, We drove it through his heart
19401,Elena, And what happens when he asks to see Mikael's body?
19402,Damon," Good point. You, my brother, have been compelled to do what Klaus says. So if the idea is to lure him back here and k*ll him, the last thing we need is you getting tripped up and tongue tied"
19403,Stefan, Well don't look at me. I'm just in charge of getting him back here
19404,Elena," Klaus is smart. If we tell him that Mikael's dead, he'll want proof"
19405,Mikael, Then I shall be dead
19406,Elena, What if he wants to see in person?
19407,Mikael," Well, it means our plan is working. Klaus will absolutely want to see my body. You lure him here, and I will k*ll him"
19408,Stefan, With what? Those daggers won't work on him
19409,Mikael," Well, I'm in possession of a stake fashioned from the wood of the ancient white oak tree The one that left these ashes when it b*rned"
19410,Damon, Where is it?
19411,Mikael, Not here. Knowing its location is my insurance policy
19412,Stefan, Against what?
19413,Mikael," You leaving this in my heart. You see, a vampire can't dagger an original without dying. So... it falls to you"
19414,Elena, You want me to actually dagger you?
19415,Mikael, Klaus will leave nothing to chance. Especially when it comes to trust
19416,Klaus, I want to see him. I want to see his rotting body for myself
19417,Stefan," Well, he's here"
19418,Stefan, Come by whenever
19419,Klaus," If you're lying to me, Stefan, your compulsion will expose you. So answer with your life. Is what you're saying the truth?"
19420,Stefan, It's true. I saw it with my own eyes
19421,Klaus, I want to talk to Rebekah
19422,Stefan, That's not a problem. She's right here
19423,Rebekah," Hello, Nik"
19424,Klaus," Rebekah, love. What's this I hear about Mikael's tragic run-in with a dagger?"
19425,Rebekah, It's true. He's finally out of our lives for good. I miss you. I'm miserable here
19426,Klaus, I'll be home soon
19427,Rebekah," Good. I'll see you then, brother"
19428,Rebekah, He bought it. He's coming home
19429,Damon, Now was that easy or what?
19430,Elena, Let's just get this over with
19431,Rebekah, Finally. Took you long enough
19432,Mikael, Rebekah...
19433,Rebekah," Whatever fatherly rubbish you're thinking, save it. Nothing you say matters to me"
19434,Mikael, I see. Where's my dagger?
19435,Rebekah, Elena has it. So you can forget your plans to use it on me
19436,Mikael, You were never the one I was after
19437,Rebekah," Nik was my family. If you were after him, you were after me"
19438,Mikael," He blinded you, Rebekah. He k*ll your mother"
19439,Rebekah, I know what he did. And he'll pay for it with his life. But Nik was not born a k*ll. None of us were. You did this to us when you turned us into vampires. You destroyed our family. Not him
19440,Mikael, Rebekah…
19441,Elena, I hate everything in my closet. I have nothing to wear to homecoming
19442,Bonnie," So don't go. Let's stay home, order take-out and over-analyze ancient hieroglyphic thingies with Alaric"
19443,Elena, We have to go. Caroline will k*ll us
19444,Bonnie," Oh, Caroline actually has a date"
19445,Elena," You know that you can talk to me about Jeremy, right?"
19446,Bonnie, I don't need to talk about it. He fell in love with his ghost girlfriend and lied about it. What's done is done
19447,Elena," You have to talk about it. He hurt you, Bonnie. I'm mad at him too"
19448,Bonnie," You're mad at your little brother. You'll yell at him a little, teach him a life lesson. You can't really be mad like I'm mad"
19449,Elena, Bonnie…
19450,Bonnie," And you shouldn't have to be. He's your brother. So no, I can't really talk to you about it"
19451,Elena, We can't trust Rebekah not to turn on us
19452,Damon," Oh, really? Because those original vampires are usually so reliable"
19453,Elena," Bonnie was right. Rebekah may be mad at Klaus now, but he is her brother"
19454,Damon," Her lying, k*ll, dagger-happy brother. The wolfsbane's ready"
19455,Elena, There are too many things that can go wrong with this plan. Too many people who can make it go wrong
19456,Damon," Well, I am formulating a secret contingency plan"
19457,Elena, Really? What is it?
19458,Damon," Well, if I told you, then it won't be a secret"
19459,Stefan, I need to borrow a tie
19460,Damon, You have your own ties
19461,Stefan, I'm 162 years old and I'm going to a homecoming dance. I need better ties
19462,Elena, You could not go
19463,Stefan," I'm compelled to protect you. And if I look at your track record at high school dances, it's pretty tragic. My luck you'll go ahead and get yourself m*rder by the homecoming queen"
19464,Elena, I know how to do it. Alaric taught me
19465,Damon," Elena, if this thing blows up in our face just remember only one of us heals quickly"
19466,Stefan," Ugh, please tell me that you have a better plan than wolfsbane grenades"
19467,Damon," Never you mind, brother. The less you know, the better"
19468,Stefan," My freedom from Klaus rests entirely upon you two executing your plan perfectly. So, excuse me if I'm a bit cynical"
19469,Elena," You're the one that we should be worried about. If Klaus asks you one wrong question, whole thing falls apart"
19470,Stefan," You do have reason to worry. But if I look back at our history of epic plan failures, it's usually because one of us let our humanity get in the way. So if I'm taking odds on how this thing goes down, it's certainly not gonna be me who screws it up. I'll see you at Homecoming. I can't wait"
19471,Caroline," Hey, can you hand me the glitter g*n?"
19472,Caroline, Thanks
19473,Tyler," Hey, can't we ditch the decorating and go grab a bite?"
19474,Caroline," Oh, I have a thermos in my bag"
19475,Tyler, I mean a real bite. Rebekah knows some people who like to be fed on. They're into it. We don't even have to compel them
19476,Caroline," Ok, first of all, I finally almost just got your mother to stop hating me. So I probably don't want to get caught in some weird vampire threesome with her son. And secondly, quit hanging out with Rebekah, the evil bl*od slut"
19477,Tyler," Just keep the claws in tonight at the dance, ok? For me?"
19478,Caroline, So who has the misfortune of being compelled to be her date?
19479,Tyler, Matt said he'd take her
19480,Caroline," Wait, you set her up with Matt?"
19481,Tyler," She wants to go to the dance, and he didn't have anyone to go with. He drinks vervain, she can't feed on him. What's the big deal?"
19482,Caroline," The big deal, Tyler, is that Matt is an innocent, good person who should not be going to dances with evil bl*od sluts"
19483,Tyler," Matt's a guy, Caroline. And Rebekah's hot. Don't overthink this"
19484,Caroline," This is a sire thing, isn't it? Please tell me this is some weird family extension of your sire bond to Klaus"
19485,Tyler," I'm here hanging streamers and have glitter all over my hands. If I'm sired to anybody, it's you"
19486,Elena," Getting a head start, huh?"
19487,Rebekah, Embarrassing truth. This is my first high school dance
19488,Elena, Ever?
19489,Rebekah," I never really had time for high school before. Nik and I were always moving around. Running. Anyway, I didn't want to leave anything to chance. Have you heard any more from him?"
19490,Elena," No. But I'm sure that when he does return, he'll do it with flair"
19491,Rebekah, And Damon and my father are all set with their plan?
19492,Elena, Yes
19493,Rebekah, Don't tell me. I don't want to know. I just want to go to the dance and leave the rest to Mikael
19494,Elena, I know it's really hard. So thank you for helping us get Klaus back into town
19495,Rebekah," Just be careful. I've been running for 1,000 years for a reason. Mikael is not a good person. And he definitely can't be trusted. No one in my family can"
19496,Elena, Are you ok?
19497,Rebekah, I've spent my whole life loving and hating my brother with equal measure. I never thought that I would be the one to help drive a stake through his heart. No tears. I... I don't want to ruin my makeup. How do I look?
19498,Elena, You look amazing. But you're missing one thing
19499,Rebekah, My mother's necklace
19500,Elena, You should wear it tonight. May I?
19501,Rebekah, Thank you
19502,Elena, I'm so sorry. I can't leave anything to chance either
19503,Damon, In the back. Harsh
19504,Elena, It had to be done. Rebekah was never going to be completely on our side
19505,Damon," Hey, I'm not judging you. It's very Katherine of you"
19506,Elena," Not the way to make me feel better about myself, Damon"
19507,Damon, It was a compliment... Sort of
19508,Elena, Stefan is right. Someone's going to let their humanity get in the way and screw this whole thing up. And it's probably going to be me
19509,Damon," Elena, you just daggered somebody. You're going to be fine"
19510,Elena," But I feel bad about it. I care too much. That's the problem, Damon. I'm the weak link"
19511,Damon," If it makes you feel any better, she's not really dead"
19512,Elena, Do you trust him? Mikael?
19513,Damon, Nope
19514,Elena, What about Stefan?
19515,Damon, No. Not as long as he's under Klaus's control
19516,Elena, Then we need a better plan
19517,Damon, I know what to do. You're just not going to like it
19518,Elena, Why not?
19519,Damon," Because when this all goes down, I don't want you having any part of it"
19520,Elena, What does that mean?
19521,Damon, Do you trust me?
19522,Elena, Yes
19523,Damon, Then you have nothing to worry about
19524,Caroline, What happened?
19525,Tyler, The gym's flooded. The dance is canceled
19526,Caroline," Excuse me? Well, what are we supposed to do now?!"
19527,Elena, So does that mean I don't have go?
19528,Caroline," You wish. No, Tyler's moving the party to his house"
19529,Elena, Kegs and beer pong for homecoming? That's... different
19530,Caroline, Just say you're still coming 
19531,Elena, I'll see you there
19532,Matt, Elena
19533,Elena," Matt, hey. Um, slight problem with your homecoming date"
19534,Matt, What happened?
19535,Elena, How would you feel about a back-up date?
19536,Caroline, How did he plan a better party than me so fast? Is that a band outside?
19537,Bonnie, Who are all these people?
19538,Caroline, This is weird. Where is Tyler?
19539,Tyler," Hey, Stefan. What's up?"
19540,Stefan," Hey, Tyler. Nice party you got going on here"
19541,Tyler," Thanks, but I'm not the one throwing it. I'm just doing what Klaus wants"
19542,Stefan, What do you mean?
19543,Tyler," It's not a party, man. It's a wake"
19544,Klaus, Good evening everyone! I want to thank you all for being here with me to celebrate. It's been a long time coming
19545,Elena, So much for homecoming
19546,Matt, This is weird. Us being here together
19547,Elena, There's Caroline. She doesn't know anything. Act normal
19548,Caroline," Hey, Klaus is here"
19549,Matt, What?
19550,Caroline," Yeah, apparently our sired hybrid friend Tyler thought it'd be ok to let his ""master"" throw a party. Well, I expected more surprise"
19551,Elena, I've learned not to be surprised by anything Klaus does. I'm going to go find Bonnie
19552,Caroline, What's going on? And what are you two doing here together? I thought you were supposed to be with Rebekah
19553,Matt, Plans changed. I need a drink
19554,Stefan, Quite the homecoming
19555,Klaus," I've been planning my father's funeral for 1,000 years. Granted, in no version of it were any of these people invited. But you get the idea"
19556,Stefan, So what now? You just stop running?
19557,Klaus, Now I reunite my family
19558,Stefan," Your family. You mean, the people you cart around in caskets?"
19559,Klaus, None of that matters anymore. Mikael's gone. Bygones will be bygones
19560,Klaus," Seems the homecoming queen still walks among the living, which leaves me to believe Rebekah isn't here. Where is she?"
19561,Stefan, I have no idea. I thought she was coming with Matt
19562,Klaus," Oh, be honest now, Stefan. Where's my sister?"
19563,Stefan," I said I have no idea. Now, would you like me to take you to your father?"
19564,Klaus," Well, it wouldn't be a party without the guest of honor, would it? Bring him to me"
19565,Stefan, All right. Perhaps there's something in it for me? My freedom from your compulsion
19566,Klaus," Oh, you want your freedom? Well, once he's dead and his w*apon destroyed, you'll have your freedom. It'll be my pleasure to give it back to you"
19567,Mikael, Did my daughter go to the dance?
19568,Damon, Yep. You missed the photo op. Did you get the stake?
19569,Mikael, I did
19570,Damon, I'm not going take your word for it. No offense to your honor and all
19571,Mikael, None taken
19572,Damon, Fancy. May I?
19573,Mikael, It's the only w*apon on this Earth that can k*ll an original. So I think I'll hold on to it. No offense
19574,Damon," I'd offer you a drink, but Katherine tells me you're more of a vampire on the rocks kinda guy"
19575,Mikael," Well, technically, you could still offer"
19576,Damon, Why feed on vampires? Don't tell me it's for the smooth aftertaste
19577,Mikael," I had a hand in creating vampires. But the bl*od lust was never my intention. Over the centuries, I learned to feed from the predator not the innocent"
19578,Stefan, Change in plans. Klaus is back. He's at the Lockwood's and he wants your body delivered to his doorstep
19579,Mikael, I'm afraid he's in for a colossal disappointment
19580,Stefan," Well, he's certainly not going to come here. I hope your plan didn't depend on that"
19581,Damon, Didn't depend on that
19582,Stefan, But you do have a plan. Right?
19583,Damon," Oh, yeah. We got a plan, right? It just doesn't involve you"
19584,Damon, Couldn't just break his neck?
19585,Mikael, It certainly occurred to me
19586,Tyler, My mom would seriously freak if she saw all these people here
19587,Klaus, Your mother won't be a problem. I compelled her to go to church and pray for your friends
19588,Tyler, What are you talking about?
19589,Klaus, I want you to look around. There's Bonnie. There's Elena and Matt. There's your pretty little girlfriend Caroline. Their big dance was wrecked tonight and who came through with a party? You did. What a pal. But who are all these other people here?
19590,Tyler, I have no idea. I've never seen half these people in my life
19591,Klaus," Well, that's because I invited a few dozen friends of my own"
19592,Klaus," That's my friend Mindy. I picked her up along the way in Kansas. Did you know that there's an entire bloodline of werewolves in the heartland? There's Tony, from North Dakota, and let's not forget the Seattle contingent"
19593,Tyler, Hold on. Are those people all hybrids?
19594,Klaus," Well, they also love a good party. And they, like you, are sired by me. They wish to serve their master. So if anyone should so much as make a move against me, they may feel obligated to retaliate. Feel free to warn your friends"
19595,Tyler, What are you up to with Klaus?
19596,Caroline, Nothing
19597,Tyler," He's on to you, Caroline. Whatever you all think you're about to pull off, he's 2 steps ahead of you"
19598,Caroline," Ok, I don't know what you're talking about"
19599,Tyler, You're lying to me
19600,Caroline," Heh, you know, actually, I'm not. I don't know anything. And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you about, because you're sired to team Klaus now. And you can't be trusted. So can we please just go back to the party?"
19601,Klaus, Where's your date?
19602,Elena, Getting me a drink
19603,Klaus, Well... Seems I have you to thank for Mikael's demise
19604,Elena, He came at me. I didn't have a choice
19605,Klaus, Still I'm impressed. It's not easy for a human to dagger an original
19606,Elena, It wasn't the first time
19607,Klaus, Right. Elijah. You seem nervous
19608,Elena, I'm not nervous. I just don't like you
19609,Klaus," Right. Straight to the point then, shall I, love? People have been after me for 1,000 years. And I am always one step ahead. So whatever it is you're thinking of trying, go for it, give it your best sh*t. You won't succeed"
19610,Hybrid," Invite-only, vampire"
19611,Damon, Here's my rsvp. Hybrid
19612,Matt, What did you do to her?
19613,Tyler, It's just vervain. She'll be fine. But I need you to get her out of here as fast as possible
19614,Matt, What's going on?
19615,Tyler," Something's going down against Klaus, and this house is full of hybrids like me that can't let anything happen to him"
19616,Matt," What do you mean, ""can't""?"
19617,Tyler, I can't explain it. I can't fight against it. I just know that I need to protect him no matter who gets in my way
19618,Matt, By attacking Caroline?
19619,Tyler," I'm protecting her, Matt! This is the only way to keep her safe. Please. Just get her out of here safely. Get everyone out"
19620,Damon," As the host, you should know those hybrids don't make the best first impression"
19621,Tyler," Whatever move you're making, Klaus is going to be ready for you. He'll k*ll anyone at this party if he has to"
19622,Damon, Tell someone who cares
19623,Damon, Ugh! What the hell is wrong with you? You're not supposed to witchy migraine me
19624,Bonnie, You weren't supposed to k*ll Tyler
19625,Damon, He tried to bite me
19626,Bonnie, What is that?
19627,Damon, Nothing
19628,Bonnie, Oh my God. Is that the... Why do you have it?
19629,Damon, Because I'm the only one who could get inside the house
19630,Mindy, You have a visitor
19631,Klaus," Well, tell my visitor I'm on the brink of victory here"
19632,Mindy, He said his name is Mikael
19633,Klaus," Then we mustn't keep him waiting. Move everyone out back. I'm going to have a little chat with my dad. Tony, you know what to do"
19634,Mikael," Hello, Niklaus"
19635,Klaus," Hello, Mikael. Won't you come in? Oh, that's right. I forgot. You can't"
19636,Mikael, Or you can come outside if you want
19637,Klaus, Or I can watch my hybrids tear you limb from limb
19638,Mikael, They can't k*ll me
19639,Klaus," True, but it'll make a hell of a party game. All I have to do is rub these 2 fingers together, and they'll pounce"
19640,Mikael," The big bad wolf. You haven't changed. Still hiding behind your playthings like a coward. You only forget. They may be sired by you, but they're still part vampire. And they can be compelled by me"
19641,Mikael," Come out and face me, Niklaus, or she dies"
19642,Klaus, Go ahead. k*ll her
19643,Elena," No, Klaus. He'll do it"
19644,Mikael," If she dies, this lot will be the last of your abominations"
19645,Klaus, I don't need them. I just need to be rid of you
19646,Mikael," To what end, Niklaus? So you can live forever with no one at your side? Nobody cares about you anymore, boy! Who do you have other than those whose loyalty you've forced? No one. No one"
19647,Klaus," I'm calling your bluff, father. k*ll her"
19648,Mikael," Come outside and face me, you little coward. And I won't have to"
19649,Klaus," My whole life you've underestimated me. If you k*ll her, you lose your leverage. So go ahead. Go on. k*ll her. Come on, old man. k*ll her. k*ll her!"
19650,Mikael," Your impulse, Niklaus. It has and will forever be the one thing that keeps you from truly being great"
19651,Mikael, Katherine...
19652,Katherine, Kaboom!
19653,Damon, What are you doing?!
19654,Damon, What the hell did you do?
19655,Klaus, He's earned his freedom.
19656,Klaus," Thank you, my friend"
19657,Klaus, You no longer have to do as I say. You're free
19658,Tyler, Are you ok?
19659,Caroline, What do you think?
19660,Tyler, I'm sorry I stabbed you. It was the only thing I could think of to get you out of there
19661,Caroline," ""Oh, hey, Caroline, I'm worried about what might happen this evening. So maybe you should just go home and watch 'Dancing with the stars?'"""
19662,Tyler," If you knew all your friends were going to get together and try to take down Klaus, would you have left?"
19663,Caroline, No
19664,Tyler, So there you go. I saved you from your own stubbornness
19665,Caroline," This isn't funny, Tyler! How am I supposed to be with you when you're sired to him?"
19666,Tyler," I need you to understand, Caroline"
19667,Caroline, Understand what? That you're one of the bad guys now?
19668,Tyler, Understand that this is who I am. There's nothing that I can do about it. Klaus can't be k*ll. I can't be fixed. Understand that I'm ok with it
19669,Caroline, But how are you ok with it?
19670,Tyler," Because it's better. I don't have to turn, Caroline. Not unless I want to. I never have to go through that pain again. If being sired to Klaus is the price that I have to pay, so be it"
19671,Caroline, But you don't have any true control over yourself
19672,Tyler, I never did before. The full moon controlled me. After everything that we've been through you've been there for me through all of it. Don't turn your back on me now
19673,Caroline, Tyler...
19674,Tyler, Right
19675,Caroline, I just...
19676,Tyler, Got it
19677,Elena, How did this happen?
19678,Damon," We thought of everything, Elena! Klaus having hybrids. Mikael turning on us. We brought in Katherine so you weren't in danger. Anything that could have gone wrong, we were prepared"
19679,Elena, I don't understand. Stefan wanted Klaus dead more than anything. That's what we were counting on
19680,Damon, We blew it
19681,Elena, Where's Katherine?
19682,Damon," She ran for the hills, like usual. The minute things got bad. Who blames her? Klaus would have crushed her. I had him, Elena. I had Klaus. This could've all be over!"
19683,Elena," Damon, hey... Hey, listen to me we'll survive this. We always survive. Trust me"
19684,Damon," We're never getting Stefan back. You know that, don't you?"
19685,Elena, Then we'll let him go. Ok? We'll have to let him go
19686,Damon," Not interested in the play by play of our failure right now, Katherine"
19687,Katherine," I'm just calling to say goodbye. I don't know what to tell you. You had a good plan, Damon. And that's high praise coming from me"
19688,Damon, It's not very comforting at the moment. You going back into hiding?
19689,Katherine," At least my life's not boring. Goodbye, Damon"
19690,Damon," Take care of yourself, Katherine"
19691,Katherine, He doesn't know where it all wrong
19692,Stefan, He doesn't need to know
19693,Katherine, Are you good from here? I need to put about a million miles between myself and Klaus as soon as possible. Stefan…
19694,Katherine, Stefan
19695,Stefan, Elena
19696,Katherine, Not exactly.
19697,Katherine, Pep up. I only got a minute before they realize that I'm not at the party
19698,Klaus, You seem nervous
19699,Katherine, I'm not nervous. I just don't like you
19700,Klaus," People have been after me for 1,000 years. And I am always one step ahead. So whatever it is you're thinking of trying, go for it, give it your best sh*t. You won't succeed"
19701,Katherine, It won't be for lack of trying
19702,Klaus," Now you'd be smart to tell Damon to mind his manners tonight. 'Cause if I die, I've already insured that he'll die along with me. Even in death, my hybrids have their orders. So you k*ll me, you're k*ll him too"
19703,Stefan, How did you know that I would stop Damon?
19704,Katherine, I didn't. I was just hoping that you would want to
19705,Katherine," If Klaus gets k*ll, he's taking Damon down with him."
19706,Stefan, So pull the plug on the plan
19707,Katherine," And face the wrath of Mikael? We'll all be dead. Ok, look. I know that you've turned off your humanity and that you don't care. So there's only one solution"
19708,Stefan, And what's that?
19709,Katherine," Care, Stefan. Care enough to save Damon's life. Because I'm going back to that party and I'm seeing this plan through. Klaus will be k*ll and we'll have our freedom. But then Damon will be dead. Your brother will be dead, Stefan. Unless you care enough to do something about it"
19710,Stefan, You've wanted Klaus dead for 500 years. Why would you risk all that just to save Damon's life?
19711,Katherine," I wasn't just trying to save Damon's life, Stefan. I was trying to save yours. Your humanity. Let's just say I like the old you better"
19712,Stefan," Nah. Come on, Katherine, you don't care about anyone but yourself. You never have"
19713,Katherine," You and I both know that that is not true. I loved you. I loved Damon too. Humanity is a vampire's greatest weakness. No matter how easy it is to turn it off, it keeps trying to fight its way back in. Sometimes I let it"
19714,Stefan, I can't let it all back in. I don't want to. Not after everything I've done
19715,Katherine," Of course you don't want to. But if you don't let yourself feel, you won't be able to do what I need you to do next"
19716,Stefan, What's that?
19717,Katherine, Get mad
19718,Klaus," Rebekah, where are you? Pick up the phone, darling. Daddy's dead. It's time for a family reunion"
19719,Klaus, Stefan. Miss me already?
19720,Stefan, I'm just calling to thank you for my freedom
19721,Klaus, I like to believe I'm a man of my word. More or less
19722,Stefan," The thing is, it came at too high of a price. You took everything from me, Klaus"
19723,Klaus," Let bygones be bygones. Trust me, resentment gets old"
19724,Stefan, You know what never gets old?
19725,Stefan, Revenge 
19726,Klaus, No!
19727,Stefan," What's the matter, Klaus? Missing something?"
19728,Klaus, What are you doing?
19729,Stefan, I'm just enjoying my freedom
19730,Klaus, I will k*ll you and every one you've ever met
19731,Stefan," You do that and you'll never see your family again. I wonder, Klaus. As someone who's been one step ahead for 1,000 years. Were you prepared for this?"
19732,Man, Excuse me. I should have been watching where I was going
19733,Elena, Don't worry about it
19734,Man, You have a nice day
19735,Elena, I think I'm going crazy. I'm totally paranoid all the time
19736,Bonnie," You have a right to be. Klaus is sill out there, and he knows you tried to k*ll him"
19737,Elena," Why hasn't he made a move? There's been no sign of him, nothing. Just my slow spiral into insanity"
19738,Bonnie," Join the club. Every time I close my eyes, I have that nightmare on repeat"
19739,Elena, The same dream?
19740,Bonnie, Yeah. 4 coffins. Klaus is in one of them. It's weird
19741,Elena," What if it's not just... Some dream? What if it's, like, you know, a witch dream?"
19742,Bonnie, It's just stress. I'll figure it out. What about Stefan?
19743,Elena," He betrayed us, Bonnie. The Stefan that we know is gone"
19744,Bonnie, How is Damon handling that?
19745,Elena, Damon is... Damon
19746,Damon," Uh, you have your choice... Bloody Mary, screwdriver. Brunch in a bottle"
19747,Damon," Come on, Ric. I can't drink all this by myself. I mean, I can, but then somebody's getting naked"
19748,Damon," Oh, man. I can't believe you're making me drink alone"
19749,Alaric, I'm busy
19750,Damon, It's the eve of Klausageddon. You're doing homework?
19751,Alaric," This may come as a shock, but I am not here to hang out with you. I'm here to see Jeremy, who is an hour late for his shift"
19752,Damon, Kids today. Where are their values?
19753,Alaric, That's his midterm paper. Copied it straight off the internet. Didn't even try to hide it
19754,Damon, Ooh. Somebody's getting grounded
19755,Bartender, Did you say you were waiting for Jeremy... As in Jeremy Gilbert?
19756,Alaric, Yeah
19757,Bartender, Yeah. He was fired last week
19758,Damon, Oops
19759,Tyler, Nice sh*t
19760,Jeremy," So what's the point of this, again?"
19761,Tyler," The point is I'm pissed at Caroline, and Bonnie dumped your ass. The point... Is to get drunk and sh**t stuff"
19762,Jeremy," Profound. If Alaric finds out I took this, he's going to use it on me"
19763,Tyler," So, what's the deal with that? He's, like, your guardian now?"
19764,Jeremy," Sort of, yeah. I think he feels responsible for us"
19765,Tyler, You like him?
19766,Jeremy, Yeah. Yeah. I like him
19767,Jeremy," Hey, you want to move out of the way?"
19768,Tyler," I'm a hybrid, Gilbert. You can't k*ll me unless you cut off my head or rip out my heart. And you're not going to do it with that lame-ass crossbow. Go ahead. Take a sh*t. Unless you don't think you can hit me"
19769,Elena," Jeremy, the minute that you get this, call me"
19770,Damon, You're feisty when you're mad
19771,Elena, It's not that I'm mad. I'm just... I'm worried
19772,Damon," Why? I think he'll survive, Elena"
19773,Elena," He's spiraling. Ever since Bonnie broke up with him, he's moody. He's not really talking to anyone"
19774,Damon, Just a typical teenager
19775,Elena, Who's seeing ghosts and who's lost everyone that he cares about
19776,Damon, Not everyone. He still has you
19777,Elena, Are you ok?
19778,Damon, What makes you think I'm not ok?
19779,Elena," Well, you're a day drunk. It's not exactly your most attractive look"
19780,Damon, Oh. What is my most attractive look?
19781,Elena, Uh-uh. I'm not saying you have any attractive look. I'm just... Saying this is my least favorite one
19782,Damon, Noted. See if I can make any improvements
19783,Klaus, Don't mind me
19784,Elena, Klaus
19785,Damon," You going to do this in the grill, in front of everyone? It's a little beneath you, don't you think?"
19786,Klaus," I don't know what you're talking about. I just came down to my local pub to grab a drink with a mate. Get a round, then, would you, Tony?"
19787,Damon, I'm surprised you stuck around town. Long enough for happy hour
19788,Klaus, My sister seems to be missing. Need to sort that out
19789,Damon," Cute, blonde b*mb, psycho. Shouldn't be too hard to find"
19790,Klaus," Truth is, I've grown to rather like your little town. Thinking I might fancy a home here. I imagine you're wondering how does this affect you. And the answer is, not in the slightest. As long as I get what I want, and everyone behaves themselves, you can go on living your little lives however you choose. You have my word"
19791,Elena, What more could you possibly want?
19792,Klaus," Well, for starters, you can tell me where I might find Stefan"
19793,Damon, Stefan skipped town the second he saved your ass
19794,Klaus," Well, you see, that is a shame. Your brother stole from me. I need him found so I can take back what's mine"
19795,Elena, That sounds like a Klaus and Stefan problem
19796,Klaus," Well, this is me broadening the scope, sweetheart"
19797,Stefan," Hello, Bonnie"
19798,Bonnie, Stefan. You followed me here?
19799,Stefan, Yeah. It wasn't too hard. You should probably be more careful
19800,Bonnie, What do you want with me?
19801,Stefan, Relax. I just need your help
19802,Bonnie, Why would I help you? Elena said you saved Klaus's life
19803,Stefan," Let me fill you in on a little secret about Klaus. He kept his family with him at all times, Daggered, stored in coffins. And now, I have them. And I need you to help keep them hidden"
19804,Bonnie, You're out of your mind. You're just going to make him angrier
19805,Stefan," His family is his one weakness. As long as I have that, I can ruin him"
19806,Bonnie, I don't have enough power to hide 4 originals
19807,Stefan, You're a witch. You hate Klaus. I know you can figure something out
19808,Alaric, You ready?
19809,Elena," Vampires, hybrids, and originals. No problem. My rebellious brother... I'm worried"
19810,Alaric, Proof you're still human
19811,Elena, Just in time. We're cooking
19812,Jeremy, Sorry. Just passing through
19813,Alaric," Aww. Well, I thought we'd all stay in, Have a meal together like a typical atypical family"
19814,Jeremy, Why?
19815,Elena, Maybe because you got fired. And you didn't tell anyone
19816,Jeremy," Look, can we do this later? I made plans with Tyler. He's right outside"
19817,Alaric , Wait. When did you start hanging out with Tyler Lockwood?
19818,Jeremy, I don't know. Does it matter?
19819,Elena," Yeah, Jeremy, it matters. He was sired by Klaus. He's dangerous"
19820,Jeremy," He can still hear you. He's right outside. Besides, you of all people are going to lecture me on who I can and can't hang out with"
19821,Elena, What is with the attitude?
19822,Jeremy, Whatever. This is lame. Tyler's waiting
19823,Elena," No. Oh, no, no. You're not going anywhere, especially not with Tyler"
19824,Alaric," I'm with her on this, Jer. Sorry"
19825,Jeremy," All right. Fine. You want me to stay in? Let's all stay in, then. Yo, Tyler, come on in"
19826,Elena, Jeremy...
19827,Klaus," I think it's about time we had a drink, don't you?"
19828,Damon, I'd say we're overdue
19829,Klaus," Well, you've been so busy, what with all your plotting and scheming"
19830,Damon, You know me... Never miss a chance to plan an epic failure
19831,Klaus, Don't be so hard on yourself. Who could have guessed your own brother would betray you?
19832,Damon," Well, I did have a front row seat when your sister lied to you"
19833,Klaus," Yeah, well, she's fickle, that one. And you say you have no idea of her whereabouts?"
19834,Damon, That's the thing with younger siblings. You just... never know what they're going to do
19835,Damon, Drink?
19836,Tyler, Thanks
19837,Elena," This is weird. Klaus has hybrids stalking me, and now, you're just sitting in our kitchen"
19838,Tyler," Look, maybe I should go"
19839,Jeremy," No, stay. You're not doing anything"
19840,Elena," Unless you have to, you know, check in with your hybrid master"
19841,Tyler," It's not like that, Elena"
19842,Alaric," Tell me, Tyler... What is the difference. Between being sired and being compelled?"
19843,Tyler," Compulsion... That's just mind control, like hypnosis. And being sired is... It's like faith. You do something because you believe it's the right thing"
19844,Elena," So, you believe that serving Klaus is the right thing"
19845,Tyler, I don't serve him. Klaus released me from a curse that was ruining my life. I owe him for that
19846,Alaric, What if he asked you to... Jump off a bridge?
19847,Tyler," He wouldn't. And even if he did, I'd be fine. I'm a hybrid"
19848,Elena, Ok. So what if he asked you to rip your own heart out?
19849,Tyler," Again, he wouldn't"
19850,Elena, What if he did?
19851,Tyler, I don't know. Then I'd rip out my heart
19852,Tyler," You guys sound like Caroline, getting all freaked out over something you don't understand"
19853,Elena," You're right, Tyler. I don't understand. Klaus has terrorized every single one of us, and you're just blindly loyal to him"
19854,Tyler, You're overthinking it. I can still make my own decisions
19855,Klaus," Cheers, mate"
19856,Damon, Down the hatch
19857,Klaus," You know, we've actually got a lot in common, you and I"
19858,Damon," Really? Well, yeah. Maybe we can... Bond over our mutual loathing of my brother. Why are you so mad at him? He stole something?"
19859,Klaus," My family. The originals. I had them daggered, boxed up, awaiting the day when I saw fit to wake them. And he went in and pinched the bloody lot"
19860,Damon," Of course he did. Ah, such a buzz k*ll, my baby bro. Well, I'd love to find him. Just the trouble is I sure as hell don't work for you"
19861,Klaus," You know, your drink stinks of vervain, so I can't compel you. There'd be no point in k*ll you, because you're actually the one with the most hope of getting me what I need. And yet, it would seem a demonstration is in order. Perhaps I wasn't clear enough when I told you to find Stefan. Oh, well. It seems you people respond best to displays of violence. Why don't you take this as an example of my reach?"
19862,Klaus," There he is. So, that thing I told you to do. Why don't you go ahead and get on with it?"
19863,Elena, What was that about?
19864,Jeremy, It was nothing
19865,Tyler," I got to go. Um, thanks for the food offer but..."
19866,Alaric, Next time
19867,Alaric," Well, that was illuminating"
19868,Elena," So, Tyler Lockwood is A lunatic who has access to our house"
19869,Alaric," I mean, this whole sire bond thing is wild. I don't even think Tyler's fully aware of what ittle reason lies behind what he's saying. It's... it's his weird cult logic"
19870,Elena," Well, great. That's a wonderful influence for you, Jer"
19871,Elena, Jeremy?
19872,Alaric, That's his ring.
19873,Elena, Jeremy? What is he doing?
19874,Elena, Oh my god!
19875,Alaric, Jeremy!
19876,Elena," Jeremy! Jeremy, move!"
19877,Tony," There I go again, bumping into people"
19878,Elena, He's going to be all right. Are you ok?
19879,Jeremy, I don't understand
19880,Elena, Who was that on the phone earlier?
19881,Jeremy, It was Klaus
19882,Elena," You were compelled, Jeremy. We've got to get him inside. Help me"
19883,Klaus," Compel the men to open up this wall. We need sun. I want a fortress, not a dungeon"
19884,Klaus, There he is. Man of the hour
19885,Tyler, So everything went ok?
19886,Klaus," Tony ran down Alaric instead of Jeremy, but apples, oranges. Message learns the same"
19887,Tyler, You said you were sending them a warning
19888,Klaus," And I did... an effective one. Elena's family suffers, she's motivated to get me what I want"
19889,Tyler, I didn't think that we'd actually have to k*ll anyone
19890,Klaus," Tyler, mate. What you're feeling is the remnant of a guilty conscience. I need you to get over it, ok? End of the day, human life here is just a means to an end... Our means to our end. You'd do well to remember that"
19891,Damon, How is he?
19892,Elena," He's dead, but he had his ring.Klaus' hybrid hit him. Now we just wait"
19893,Damon," Jeremy, why aren't you wearing vervain? Where's your bracelet?"
19894,Jeremy, I don't know
19895,Elena," It was Tyler. It had to have been. That's why he was hanging out with you, to get you off the vervain"
19896,Damon," Klaus is trying to send us a message. He wants us to find Stefan, who stole his coffins of all his dead family members"
19897,Elena, Coffins?
19898,Damon," Yep. So all we have to do is find 4 coffins, and voila, no one else on your family's chritmas list has to die"
19899,Jeremy," Wait, that's your big plan, to steal back 4 dead originals. so this evil hybrid doesn't k*ll me. And everyone else we know?"
19900,Damon, You got a better idea?
19901,Jeremy, Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here. Pack our bags and go
19902,Elena," Hey, Jeremy, calm down"
19903,Jeremy," No. No, I'm not going to calm down, Elena. This happens every time no matter what we do... You get on my case about school and work. Who cares. None of us are going to make it out of this town alive"
19904,Elena, He said he wants his family back
19905,Damon," No. No, I know what you're thinking. The answer's no"
19906,Elena, If we give him Rebekah...
19907,Damon," Yeah, then Klaus un-daggers her. First thing she does is k*ll you. Frying pan, fire. Not an option"
19908,Elena, Klaus's coffins. How many did you say there were?
19909,Bonnie, Elena? Hey
19910,Elena," Klaus is looking for 4 coffins, just like in your dream. I think it's not just stress"
19911,Bonnie," Elena, don't get involved. Whatever Klaus wants, stay as far away from it as you can"
19912,Elena, Klaus won't let me. Bonnie... He tried to k*ll Jeremy
19913,Bonnie, What do you want me to do?
19914,Elena," We need to find Stefan. Look, I know that you don't think that your locater spell still works, but we have to at least try "
19915,Bonnie, We don't need a locater spell
19916,Damon, Bonnie said this place lost all its mojo
19917,Elena, The dead witches were angry at her for bringing Jeremy back to life. I guess now they have something they want her to know
19918,Damon," That's why I hate witches. So fickle, passive-aggressive"
19919,Elena, Stefan?
19920,Damon," Come on, Stef. Olly olly oxen free"
19921,Damon, Really? Still?
19922,Elena, What?
19923,Damon," The witchy spirits aren't a big fan, and they used their juju to screw with my daylight ring"
19924,Elena, Then wait outside
19925,Damon, Elena...
19926,Elena, I'm not leaving until I know if he's here
19927,Elena, Stefan?
19928,Stefan," Go away. You shouldn't be here, Elena"
19929,Elena," Stefan, I need your help. Bonnie said that you would be here"
19930,Stefan," Well, Bonnie sucks at keeping secrets"
19931,Elena," Listen, you need to give Klaus his family back"
19932,Stefan, Oh really? Is that what i need to do?
19933,Elena," Klaus compelled Jeremy to stand in front of a speeding car. Don't you get it? Stefan, he's not going to stop until he gets what he wants..."
19934,Stefan," Elena, stop talking. I'm not giving Klaus anything"
19935,Elena, Are you listening to me? He's going to k*ll Jeremy
19936,Stefan, Not really my problem
19937,Elena, Then you can go to hell
19938,Damon, That didn't go over well
19939,Elena," Don't even start, Damon"
19940,Damon, Let me talk to him
19941,Elena, You can't get in. The witches won't let you
19942,Damon, Here. Take my car keys. You go deal with your brother. I'll deal with mine
19943,Stefan," Wow. That was impressive. But the coffins aren't here, so you can go away now"
19944,Damon, I don't care about the coffins. We need to talk
19945,Stefan, Ok. Let's talk
19946,Damon," Nothing's ever easy with you, is it?"
19947,Damon," That is for screwing up my plan. You stopped me from k*ll Klaus, and you steal his family. Why? It doesn't make sense. Answer me!"
19948,Stefan," Piece by piece, Klaus took everything from me. I'm doing the same to him"
19949,Damon," But I had him, Stefan! Why'd you screw it up?"
19950,Stefan, I did it to save you!
19951,Damon, What? No. No way. You didn't do this for me
19952,Stefan," He was one step ahead of us. If Klaus died, his hybrids would have k*ll you"
19953,Damon, When are you going to get it through your head?
19954,Damon, Stop saving me
19955,Tyler," Don't do it, Jeremy"
19956,Jeremy," Why not? You stab my back, I stab yours"
19957,Tyler, I didn't stab you in the back
19958,Jeremy," Is that why you wanted to hang out, to get me off the vervain?"
19959,Tyler, Klaus asked me to. I never thought he would try to k*ll you
19960,Jeremy," It's Klaus, Tyler. What did you think was going to happen?"
19961,Tyler, He doesn't care about you. All he wants is to get his family back
19962,Tyler, What the hell?!
19963,Jeremy," Whenever Klaus wants something, someone ends up dead. You think about that next time before you blindly do whatever he says"
19964,Tyler," Jer, you should get home. Stay inside. Klaus isn't going to stop until he gets all those coffins back. He's not done with you"
19965,Elena, Ric. Hey. When did you return to the living?
19966,Alaric," Oh, just a few minutes ago. How's Jeremy?"
19967,Elena, Hating me. Hating life. Hating the fact that we can't even have a family dinner Without somebody dying before dessert. Are you okay?
19968,Elena, Oh my god
19969,Alaric, Something's wrong. The ring
19970,Paramedic, What happened?
19971,Elena," He got hit by a car, and he's coughing up bl*od"
19972,Paramedic, Get his vitals. Pulse thready and weak. Looks like internal bleeding. We got to get him out of here. Let's move
19973,Tony, Let's not and say we did. Why don't you two meet us at the hospital?
19974,Elena," What? No. No, no, no. Wait. No, wait. You have to help him"
19975,Elena, What are you doing?
19976,Tony," You can still save his life, Elena. Here. Take my bl*od. But... I can't get in. You're going to have to invite me"
19977,Elena, No. Why are you doing this?
19978,Tony, Klaus asked for his family. You didn't deliver
19979,Elena," Ric! Oh, my god, Ric. I'm right here. Hey. Hey, look"
19980,Tony," I would invite me in, Elena"
19981,Elena, Jeremy
19982,Jeremy, He's not dead yet
19983,Elena, Where are you going?
19984,Elena, What are you doing?
19985,Jeremy," Now he's dead. We've got to get Alaric to the hospital, now"
19986,Damon," You know what I can't figure out? Why save me? Was it brotherly love, guilty conscience, Is the switch on, is the switch off?"
19987,Stefan," Do you have somewhere you need to be, Damon?"
19988,Damon," Ah, deflection. That's not going to work on me. I invented that"
19989,Stefan, We're done. Can't you just go away?
19990,Damon, Not until you tell me why you saved me. You owe me that
19991,Stefan, I don't owe you anything
19992,Damon," Fine. Next question, why did you steal the coffins?"
19993,Stefan, Because Klaus's family is one weakness I can use against him
19994,Damon," Use against him to do what? You're not going to k*ll him. You know how I know this? 'Cause there was only one way to k*ll him, and you blew that to save me"
19995,Stefan," You're wrong, Damon. Klaus doesn't get to just live forever. There's another way. There has to be"
19996,Damon," Fair enough. Whatever you're doing, I want in"
19997,Stefan, I don't need your help
19998,Damon," Really? Last time I checked, you were hiding out in a haunted house"
19999,Stefan," I'm in this alone, Damon"
20000,Damon," You go after Klaus, you're going to have to be cutthroat and devious. I'm so much better at that than you. Come on, brother. What do you say? If you're going to keep saving my life, at least make it for a good reason"
20001,Stefan," You want in, huh? Ok. But it's just me and you. Elena stays out of it"
20002,Damon, Deal
20003,Stefan, Follow me
20004,Damon, Wait. I'm not so... Welcome in there
20005,Stefan," Don't you worry, Damon. We all want the same thing"
20006,Stefan, Have a look
20007,Damon, What? Klaus is allergic to dust?
20008,Stefan, Mmm. Look again
20009,Stefan, Witch spirits hate Klaus as much as we do. They're using their powers to hide the coffins
20010,Damon, So if he comes in the house...
20011,Stefan, He won't be able to find them
20012,Dr Fell, Mr. Saltzman. What are you doing up? You should be resting
20013,Alaric," Uh, I'm more of a walk-it-off kind of guy. Ahem. Do I need to sign something?"
20014,Dr Fell," Internal hemorrhaging, 3 broken ribs, and a severe concussion. I have no idea how you're on your feet right now, but I need to run some more tests"
20015,Alaric," Actually, I have someplace I need to be. But thank you, Doctor..."
20016,Dr Fell, Fell. But the patients who follow my advice get to call me Meredith
20017,Alaric," Well, I appreciate your help, Dr. Fell"
20018,Dr Fell," Mr. Saltzman... What is your secret? Guardian angel, or did you sell your soul to the devil?"
20019,Alaric, Little of both
20020,Elena, Thank you for coming
20021,Klaus, I trust you have news of Stefan
20022,Elena, I couldn't find him. But I have something else
20023,Klaus, My poor sister. I can't turn my back on her for a moment
20024,Elena, You have Rebekah. A deal is a deal
20025,Klaus," The life of my sister in exchange for your brother? Yeah, I'd say that's a bargain. Consider him spared"
20026,Elena," You should know, I was the one that daggered her. When she wakes, she'll come after me"
20027,Klaus," I can control Rebekah. Besides, I still need your help finding Stefan"
20028,Elena," I told you, I don't know where he is"
20029,Klaus," You're lying. Fortunately, you have no shortage of loved ones. If I don't find my family, the question you should be asking yourself is, who's going to die next? Bonnie? Caroline? Damon? It's only a matter of time before Stefan gives me what I want"
20030,Elena," He doesn't care about me any more. You made sure of that. You turned him into a monster. Now he's your problem. And just so you know, I'm not the only one Rebekah wants dead. She knows what you did to your mother. She knows that you k*ll her. You can let yourself out"
20031,Jeremy," So the ring brought you back to life, but it didn't heal you. Does that mean it's broken?"
20032,Alaric, I don't know. It's never happened like that before. I guess I have Damon's bl*od to thank. For the fact that I'm still walking
20033,Jeremy, He said to say you owe him a drink
20034,Alaric," That's funny. I'd rather have head trauma. Hey, Jeremy... You ok?"
20035,Jeremy," Why wouldn't I be? I sh*t a hybrid in the back and chopped his head off with a meat cleaver. Typical sunday, uh?"
20036,Alaric," You can talk to me about this stuff. You know that, right?"
20037,Jeremy," What could you tell me that I don't already know? This is the way things are. It sucks, but I just got to get used to it"
20038,Elena, Did you get rid of him?
20039,Damon, Yeah. Tony the headless hybrid's. now at the bottom of Steven's quarry
20040,Elena, What about Alaric?
20041,Damon," Took care of him, too. He'll be fine. How are you?"
20042,Elena, I think I got most of the bl*od off the porch
20043,Damon, Elena. Look at me
20044,Damon, It's going to be ok
20045,Elena, I have to tell you something. I made a deal with Klaus. I gave him Rebekah
20046,Damon," What? No, no. No. You did not do that. She's going to come here and try and k*ll you"
20047,Elena," No, she won't. Klaus won't let her because he needs me"
20048,Damon," And suddenly, you trust him?"
20049,Elena," No, I don't trust him. But what other choice do I have? I don't trust Stefan. Do you think he's just going to give up the coffins?"
20050,Damon, My brother's... Sort of running his own show right now
20051,Elena, Yeah. My brother just chopped off someone's head. It's not right. It's not fair. He's 16 years old. He shouldn't have to live like this
20052,Damon, Elena...
20053,Elena, There has to be another way. I have to fix it
20054,Damon, We will. Hey. Hey. Hey
20055,Damon, We will. Ok?
20056,Klaus," Here we are, Rebekah. Home, sweet home. Only took 1,000 years. And to think, I was counting on you being here with me. But that's all ruined now, isn't it?"
20057,Klaus, I'm so sorry. Sister. We'll meet again one day
20058,Elena, Hey. Can we talk?
20059,Jeremy, What did I do now?
20060,Elena," I've been thinking about what you said earlier, about how we should pack up and go"
20061,Jeremy," Elena, I didn't mean any of that"
20062,Elena, But you were right. You shouldn't have to give up a normal life. Just because of me
20063,Jeremy, What's going on?
20064,Damon, Your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks
20065,Damon," Here's the thing, Jeremy. You're going to go out of town for a little while. A long while. You're going to stay with some nice family friends in Denver. You're going to be in a new school and meet new girls... Living girls. You're going to drink a few beers, take an art class. You can do whatever you want"
20066,Alaric, Tell him he's going to leave mystic falls behind and never think twice about it
20067,Damon," You're going to leave mystic falls behind and never think twice about it. You're going to have a better life, Jeremy"
20068,Bonnie, This is the one I dreamed of
20069,Stefan, Don't bother. It won't open
20070,Bonnie," What do you mean, is it locked?"
20071,Stefan," Nope. It just won't open. I've tried everything... Blow torch, ax, crowbar. I can't even scratch the finish"
20072,Bonnie, That means it's closed with a spell
20073,Stefan, You mean whatever's in there should probably stay in there
20074,Bonnie, You said you wanted to make him suffer. The witches led me here for a reason. I think whatever's inside this coffin is our answer
20075,Elena, I feel like a horrible person
20076,Damon," You just saved his life, Elena. Take it from me... Estranged is bad. Dead is worse"
20077,Elena, Just can't stop thinking about what happened. The last time I asked you to compel him
20078,Damon," He found out, and he got over it. Again, not dead, Elena. He's so lucky to have you for a sister"
20079,Elena, Thank you
20080,Damon, No problem
20081,Elena," Not just for this, Damon. For everything. I don't know what I would do if you weren't here"
20082,Damon," You should know this, Elena. Stefan didn't screw us over. He screwed us over, but he had a good reason"
20083,Elena, What?
20084,Damon, He saved Klaus to save me. Then he stole the coffins to get even
20085,Elena," Damon, if he did it to protect you, then... Why would he even do that? I mean... Oh, what does it even mean?"
20086,Damon, What does it mean? It means I'm an idiot. 'Cause I thought for one second that I wouldn't have to feel guilty any more
20087,Elena," What are you talking about, guilty for what?"
20088,Damon, For wanting what I want
20089,Elena, Damon...
20090,Damon," No, I know. Believe me, I get it. My brother's girl and all"
20091,Damon," No. No. You know what? If I'm going to feel guilty about something, I'm going to feel guilty about this"
20092,Damon, Good night
20093,ALARIC, Hey you're gonna hole that thing. You want to talk about it?
20094,ELENA, Nothing to talk about.
20095,DAMON, Good morning.
20096,STEFAN, You're late. We were supposed to met Bonnie at the witch house in ten minutes.
20097,DAMON," Relax, brother. Your hair won't fall out."
20098,STEFAN," Would you hurry up? We have work to do. You know, Klaus isn't gonna easily self-destructif. Why are you all cheaper?"
20099,DAMON, No reason. Give me a minute.
20100,ALARIC," So, what's get you worked up?"
20101,ELENA, I haven't rallye sleep last night.
20102,ALARIC," Yeah, me neither. Probably something to do with dying."
20103,ELENA, You're okay?
20104,ALARIC, Yeah I'm fine. I think the ring has no longer batteries.
20105,ELENA," Yeah, it's annoter reason why Jeremy has to get out of the town. Those ring have a short last, he is not protected, neither are you."
20106,ALARIC," Nice, nice, you're getting stronger. "
20107,ELENA, I just evacuate frustration. I need a coffee.
20108,ALARIC," Seems Damon's compulsion worked, Jeremy was packing when I left the house, going on about his new school in Denver. "
20109,ELENA, Have you talk to Damon today?
20110,ALARIC, No. Why?
20111,ELENA, No reason. 
20112,BONNIE, Why won't you open?!
20113,BONNIE, Hello? Someone there? 
20114,STEFAN," You didn't say anything to Elena about the coffins, right?"
20115,DAMON," No, I said I wouldn't."
20116,STEFAN, I know what you said.
20117,DAMON, Why are you asking?
20118,STEFAN," Because protecting the location of Klaus's family is my number one priority right now. And the fewer people will know, the better. What? "
20119,DAMON," This hybrids, they are bringing the neighboorhood down. "
20120,BONNIE," Hey, sorry I'm late, I… I'd held up."
20121,ELENA, It's okay. I just got here too. Could you pass me the balloons? Thank's. Why are you running late? 
20122,BONNIE, I was working on some new spells. You?
20123,ELENA," Working with Alaric. So, I have something I need to tell you, and you're not gonna like it."
20124,BONNIE, What happenned?
20125,ELENA," Jeremy is gonna be living town for a while. He will stay with old family friend in Denver, until Klaus will blow over. "
20126,BONNIE, Jeremy world just leave you deal with Klaus on your own.
20127,ELENA," I know, I asked Damon to compel him."
20128,BONNIE, You what?
20129,ELENA," I know, Bonnie. But it's not safe here for him anymore. Leaving will give him a better life. The only reason I'm telling you is because I know that you two haven't really walked out on your stuff. And I thought maybe you'd wanna say goodbye. "
20130,STEFAN, You're wasting your time. It won't open. Did you bury the body?
20131,DAMON, Any sign of our little hybrid buddies?
20132,STEFAN," Nope, just the dead one. "
20133,DAMON," Alright, Klaus has 6 siblings. Rebekah is now with Klaus. There was one dead kid in the old world, one dead kid in the new world, which leaves Elijah and two others. Three sleeping originals, four coffins. So who is in the locked box?"
20134,STEFAN," No idea. But whatever is in here, Bonnia seems to think that it will help us k*ll Klaus. So the sooner she can get this open, the sooner we will know if she's right. "
20135,DAMON," Oh you think, spirits from a band of dead witches that can make the coffins invisible wouldn't figure out how to open one. Fine, don't help. "
20136,STEFAN," You know that none of this is gonna do any good if Klaus's hybrid friend find our hidding place, right? They need to go away. "
20137,DAMON," Oh yeah, great idea Stefan. Why don't you ask them just to pack their bag and take a long rest while we are on it. How about to keep the peace? Don't attend to the real thing we are trying to hide."
20138,STEFAN, Well I'm not gonna play defence when I have what Klaus wants. He does what I say or I dumb his family to the bottom of the ocean.
20139,DAMON," And he k*ll you and everyone you know like, I don't know... me! "
20140,STEFAN," No, he is bluffing. His family means more than anything else. "
20141,DAMON, You're sure about that?
20142,STEFAN," Well I don't know Damon. I mean, I guess there's only one way to find out, right? Klaus bluffs."
20143,DAMON," The only way to know if someone bluffs, Stefan, is to be ready to loose everything if you're wrong."
20144,BONNIE," Denver, hum? So, were you going to say goodbye?"
20145,JEREMY, I wasn't sur you cared.
20146,BONNIE," Of course I care. I was hurt by what happenned between you and Anna, Jeremy. I don't want you to leave town."
20147,JEREMY, I think this could be a good thing. Until Klaus's stuff blows over. I think I could have a better life there. 
20148,BONNIE, It's what Elena said. It's exactly what she said.
20149,JEREMY, What do you mean?
20150,BONNIE," Nothing. I'm just sorry you have to go, that's all. "
20151,CAROLINE, I can't talk to you.
20152,TYLER, I know you're upset but...
20153,CAROLINE,"? Upset? You almost got Jeremy k*ll! And before you ask me to understand or to support you, can you at least tell me what you're planning to do about your attachment on Klaus?"
20154,TYLER," There is nothing that I can do about it Caroline, That's the point. I just want you to know that I understand why you can't be with me. Even if I want to put you first, before anyone, I can't, I'll never be able to. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just want you to know that."
20155,CAROLINE, I'm sorry too. 
20156,TYLER, Happy birthday.
20157,KLAUS," Sweet dreams Rebekah. Show her to her room, would you, love?"
20158,HYBRID, Sure.
20159,KLAUS," I'm surprise you're still in town. I gave you your freedom, you could go anywhere."
20160,STEFAN, I live here Klaus.
20161,KLAUS," Well if we're playing this game, then, I was here first."
20162,STEFAN," You know, I don't like your hybrids friends. They are everywhere, kind of like flies. I want them gone. "
20163,KLAUS," Yeah, well I kind of like having them around. You know, I'm hurt. I hoped that when I free you, we pick where we left off. But here you are, engulfing vervaine like the rest of them, I'm sure. So, how much for friendship. "
20164,STEFAN, Friends don't screw friends from their free will.
20165,KLAUS," Okay, granted, that was a little extreme, but I get a little moody. Just ask my siblings. Speaking of whom, isn't time to get over? "
20166,STEFAN," Klaus, get your hybrids out of Mystic falls or I will remove them myself. "
20167,KLAUS," You see, if you continue to threat me, I'm gonna be forced to retaliate. k*ll people. And it will get messy again."
20168,STEFAN," Do whatever you want, I don't really care. Or you know what? Maybe I do. Maybe I care so much, that I'll drop Elijah in the Arctic. "
20169,KLAUS," Well, maybe I'll be willing to loose one brother if it means k*ll yours. "
20170,STEFAN," Try me, let's find out. "
20171,HYBRID, Is everything ok? 
20172,KLAUS," Everything is fine, Mindy. Stefan was just leaving after failing to make his point. "
20173,STEFAN," Well, one down. You may want send the rest of them away before it gets messy, again. "
20174,MATT, Happy birthday!
20175,CAROLINE, What are you guys doing here?
20176,ELENA," Well you blew of school and miss our work of birthday art, so..."
20177,BONNIE," Change your clothes, we are going to the falls. Smores, camp fire."
20178,ELENA," Cake, like when we were little."
20179,MATT, Except for the tequila!
20180,CAROLINE," Thanks, guys. Really, but, I just no feeling my birthday this year."
20181,BONNIE," I'm sorry, what? You already claimed your birthday as everyone's favorite day of the year."
20182,CAROLINE," Yeah, and now, it's just reminded that technically, I'm dead. Look, I'm not even 17. And the only point to 17 is to get to 18, it's a failure year, I'm stuck in a failure year."
20183,ELENA, You're not stuck Caroline. 
20184,CAROLINE," Yeah I am, but it's okay. It's all good, I will be fine. But I just need some time to get used to it."
20185,ELENA," Okay, well I think I have another idea. "
20186,HYBRID, What do you want me to do with her head? 
20187,KLAUS, Just get rid of it. Burn it. I honestly don't care Daniel.
20188,TYLER, You called? I'm here. What happenned? 
20189,KLAUS, What happenned is Stefan had two possibilities and he chose the one that make me angry. I need you to help me to do something about that. 
20190,TYLER, Can't you just leave me out of it?
20191,KLAUS, What would be the point of that? 
20192,TYLER," Seriously man, can't you just ask another hybrid to do the work? I lost my friends, my girl-friend. "
20193,KLAUS," Right, your girl-friend, about her, I need you to bite her."
20194,TYLER, What? 
20195,KLAUS, Don't make me repeat myself.
20196,TYLER, A hybrid bite would k*ll a vampire.
20197,KLAUS," Yeah, I know exactly what it will do. Stefan push me too far so I'm pushing back."
20198,TYLER, I'm not bitting Caroline.
20199,KLAUS," Tyler, you've been supernaturaly blessed for the good fortune I've onto you. So consider me to putting your loyalty to a test."
20200,TYLER, What the hell is wrong with you? I'm not hurting Caroline.
20201,KLAUS," Alright. I'm disappointed but you know, it's your choice, free will and all that. I'll find another way to strike on Stefan. You can go now."
20202,ALARIC, I thought Stefan saved your life.
20203,DAMON, I did.
20204,ALARIC, And now he is ready to risk it just to see how far he can push Klaus?
20205,DAMON, It seems so.
20206,ALARIC, So his humaity are on or off?
20207,DAMON," I think there is another option playing, a demur switch, which is a huge problem."
20208,ALARIC, Why?
20209,DAMON, Because I can't predict how far he wanted to going until someone gets k*ll.
20210,ALARIC, So you suddenly cares who lives oy dies?
20211,DAMON, I have a small list.
20212,ALARIC, Talk about humanity demur switch.
20213,DAMON, Screw you.
20214,ALARIC, Can't a council meeting just be a council meeting?
20215,ELENA, So it is. 
20216,BONNIE," This is creepy, even for us. "
20217,ELENA," No, Caroline was right., technicaly, she is dead. Sorry. But you don't need a birthday, you need a funeral. You need to say goodbye to your old life so then you can move on with your new one."
20218,CAROLINE," Okay, here lies Caroline Forbes."
20219,ELENA," Cheerleader, Miss Mystic Falls, third grade hopscotch champion."
20220,BONNIE," Friend, daughter, perfectionnist."
20221,MATT," Meangirl, sometimes, no offense."
20222,CAROLINE," Ah, no taken."
20223,ELENA," She was 17, and qhe had a really good life. So rest in peace, so that she can move forward. That's what you really need. What we all really need. Amen, or cheers or whatever. Hum, Bonnie?"
20224,ELENA," Nice. Okay, make a wish."
20225,DAMON, It's the bridge where Elena and Jeremy's parents died on a car accident.
20226,ALARIC, Something is up with her. Elena. Something more than usual. You know what it is?
20227,DAMON," Well I'm sure it starts with a ""Stef"" and ends with a ""n"". I'm gonna get a drink, write a check and then we're out. "
20228,DR.FELL, Alaric Saltzman. Miracal patient.
20229,ALARIC, Dr. Fell. 
20230,DR.FELL, I'm glad to see you still alive. A part of me thought you would have drop dead in your sleep. 
20231,ALARIC, Well I guess I have nine lifes.
20232,DR.FELL, Not bad to having in a town with vampire problem.
20233,ALARIC, Sorry? Are you on the founders council?
20234,DR.FELL," I'm a found, I come from a long lign of founders. May they rest in peace. I hate that bridge. My senior prom date dumbed me on this bridge."
20235,ALARIC," Oh yeah, you threw him over?"
20236,DR.FELL," No, but I should have. I've been holding a rage ever since. Where did your friend go? I'm supposed to held him up for some money for the fundraiser."
20237,ALARIC," Well you should, he is loaded. "
20238,DR.FELL, He is in good company. Some British guy just plegde to match every dollar we raised.
20239,ALARIC, What do you mean a British guy?
20240,KLAUS, What colour are your eyes? 
20241,CAROl, They are blue.
20242,KLAUS," Oh yes, they are. "
20243,DAMON, Look at what the cat drag down. Nice veste. 
20244,KLAUS," Thank you very much, good to see you Damon. Carol and I were discusting about were you be a big benefactor."
20245,CAROL, What do you say Damon? Klaus has made a very generous pledge. You know how we drummed on the b*at to start the renovation. 
20246,DAMON," Carol, don't take it in the wrong way, but do you realize that you've been kissing the ass of an immoral hybrid who ruined your son's life?"
20247,KLAUS," Oh, it comes now. Some has said that I saved him from all that nasty full moon business. I'd already come through myself more than twice to be honest but still, I'm very sympathetic."
20248,CAROL," Klaus has promised to protect Tyler, Damon. And our town."
20249,DAMON, From who? His hybrids are the one the town needs protection from.
20250,KLAUS, I'd have no use for them if your brother would kindly return my family. 
20251,DAMON, Not gonna happen.
20252,KLAUS," That's what I thought, which is why I've come to an agreement with the maire. You and the council stay out of my way, I stay out of yours. Your town gets protected, my hybrids get left alone and everybody will be happy. All you have to do is to get Stefan to stop decapitating my friends."
20253,CAROL," Please Damon, just get your brother under control or the council will be forced to take actions against him. "
20254,DAMON, You guy would be kidding me.
20255,KLAUS," Oh come on mate, give peace a chance. "
20256,ELENA," I need it more than you do, trust me. Caroline, what are you doing?"
20257,CAROLINE, What? Nothing. 
20258,ELENA," Okay, you're a bad sobber liar, and even worse drunk liar."
20259,CAROLINE, I might texted Tyler. 
20260,ELENA, Caroline...
20261,CAROLINE, What? I'm frail.
20262,BONNIE, Give her a break. You can't control what everyone does all the time.
20263,ELENA, Wow.
20264,BONNIE," Sorry, I know it's Caroline birthday, funeral or whatever but, I just feel it's really wrong to compel Jeremy to leave town."
20265,ELENA," I'm doing it to protect him, Bonnie. I want to give him a chance to have a quiet normal life."
20266,BONNIE," He should be able to choose how he wants to live it, you're taking his choices away. "
20267,ELENA," Bonnie, you can't tell him."
20268,BONNIE, Why? Are you gonna compel me not to?
20269,MATT," You know, you guys are ruining a perfect funeral. "
20270,BONNIE, I'm sorry. I just go sleep it off or something. Happy birthday. 
20271,LIZ, The maire is looking out for Tyler. For now we have to assume Klaus had him in his pocket. 
20272,DAMON, Oh please don't tell me you're gonna drink the Klaus cool Eden.
20273,LIZ, I'm not gonna let him hold this town hostage. But I'm also not gonna let innocent people get caught in a cross fire in a piss contest between a hybrid and a vampire.
20274,DAMON," Liz, I'm impressed, you're all strong and sheriffy."
20275,LIZ, I'm not kidding Damon. Get Stefan to stand down from this one before someone gets hurt.
20276,MAN, What are you doing? You're gonna ruining your career.
20277,DR.FELL, Says the guy who got his jod from his dad.
20278,MAN, Do you have any idea what you're dealing with?
20279,DR.FELL, I know what I'm doing.
20280,MAN, Damn it Meredith.
20281,MEREDITH," Back off, Brian."
20282,ALARIC, Everything all right here?
20283,BRIAN, Everything is fine.
20284,ALARIC, Didn't look fine.
20285,BRIAN," You might want to get to know her, before you become her white knight. She's a kind of a psycho case. "
20286,ALARIC," You're that guy, aren't you? The one who beg to have a stick kick then."
20287,BRIAN," Take it from me man, life is too short."
20288,MEREDITH," Just go away, Brian. My senior prom date."
20289,ALARIC, Well you definitly should have throw him over the bridge.
20290,MEREDITH," Unfortunatly, I have to work with him. He is on the council, the medical examiner. The guy who write under death cause ""animal attack"". "
20291,ALARIC, I get it.
20292,MEREDITH, Duty calls. Thanks for the hero moment. 
20293,ALARIC, Anytime. 
20294,STEFAN, What are you doing?
20295,DAMON, What are you doing? No dead hybrids at a founders party.
20296,STEFAN," No I told Klaus get hybrids out of the town, he did listen so I'm gonna say it louder. "
20297,DAMON," You don't think that 10 more will then come from. And if you k*ll them, Klaus won't make 20 more? You forgot about the Elena's part of novel? Or you not care if she is a human bl*od bag for the rest of her life. "
20298,STEFAN, Protecting Elena is your problem now. Cause I'm not compeled by Klaus to do it anymore.
20299,DAMON," Don't give me that no-humanity crap, you can't just switch. Your switch is grilled Stefan, just like your brain. You want to take Klaus? You want to be the villain? You got to be smarter. "
20300,STEFAN," To be the villain Damon, you have to be the better villain. "
20301,TYLER," Sorry, I didn't mean to smash the party."
20302,MATT, So don't.
20303,CAROLINE," No, it's, it's okay. "
20304,TYLER, Can I talk to you for a sec? It's kind of important. 
20305,ELENA, Are you okay?
20306,MATT," Yeah, I want her to be happy you know. It's what I want for all of you guys, in the middle of this crazy life we gotta stuck in. "
20307,ELENA," Is that how you see it? That we are stuck? Bonnie is right, you know I had no business messing onto Jeremy's head. I just don't know what else to do. He is in danger here. I can't loose anyone else that I love. "
20308,TYLER, I take it all back. Everything I said this morning. Klaus can't control me. No when it comes to you. I won't let him.
20309,CAROLINE," Tyler, it's okay. Maybe we just meant to be together. Maybe we just have to accept that and move on. "
20310,TYLER, I'm not moving on from anything. I love you.
20311,CAROLINE, What?
20312,CAROLINE, What just happenned? Did you just bite me?
20313,TYLER, Oh my god. I'm sorry.
20314,CAROLINE, Oh my god! Just get away from me! Get away from me! 
20315,MATT, Caroline! 
20316,ELENA," Great; we've been abandoned. Okay we're going back to the party, I don't trust them, she could get back together with him."
20317,MATT, Caroline!
20318,ELENA, Come on Caroline we don't have anymore drinks! Matty is afraid about the fell ghosts.
20319,ELENA, What are you doing Stefan?
20320,STEFAN," Hello Damon, she is a little busy right now. "
20321,DAMON, Why the hell have you the Elena's phone?
20322,STEFAN, I'm making my next move. Let me ask you something. What klaus is gonna do if he can't make anymore hybrids?
20323,ELENA, What?
20324,DAMON," Stefan, leave her out of this. "
20325,ELENA, What are you doing? Stefan let me out of this car. Do you hear me? Let me out of the car!
20326,KLAUS, What now? You just put me away from a fascinating conversation about man to get in the time square. 
20327,DAMON, Stefan just grabbed Elena.
20328,KLAUS," Well, he's getting desperate."
20329,DAMON," He's trying to use her against you. Do what he says, get rid of your hybrids. "
20330,KLAUS, Or what? Stefan would never dream of k*ll her.
20331,DAMON, You're sure about that? He just behead someone in the middle of a council party. He is exploiting on crazy right now. 
20332,KLAUS," Wel, crazy or not, that kind of love never dies. He is bluffing."
20333,DAMON," Maybe he is, may be he isn't but if you don't want to believe him, believe me. I know my brother better than anyone and right now I don't have a clue how far he is willing to take this. So if he says blink, I suggest you blink. "
20334,MATT, Sheriff Forbes! 
20335,LIZ, What happenned?
20336,MATT, Tyler bit her. 
20337,LIZ," Oh my god, sweet heart. Be careful. Caroline, honey, can you hear me? "
20338,CAROLINE, I'm sorry mom. 
20339,MATT," She gets hallucinating or something, I don't know. No one's picking up the phone. "
20340,LIZ, It's alright sweet heart. 
20341,ELENA," So what's the plan, Stefan? What's the big move you're making? "
20342,STEFAN, I took Klaus's family to make him suffer. I'm gonna make him suffer a new one.
20343,ELENA, So what are you gonna do? Are you gonna lock me in some cave and keep me hostage? 
20344,STEFAN, Maybe I'll just turn you into a vampire. 
20345,ELENA, Stop the car Stefan! Stop the car Stefan!
20346,KLAUS," Stefan, how nice to hear your voice."
20347,STEFAN, Tell your hybrids to get out of the town Klaus.
20348,KLAUS, Well that's not gonna happen until I get my coffins back. 
20349,STEFAN," Okay, well I'm gonna drive your bl*od source off the Wickery Bridge."
20350,KLAUS," I don't believe you Stefan, you won't k*ll her. "
20351,ELENA, No! No! No! What are you doing?
20352,KLAUS, What's going on?
20353,STEFAN, I just fed her with my bl*od. No more hybrids if she is a vampire.
20354,KLAUS, You won't do it.
20355,STEFAN," Really? Try me, because your coffins are next to go. Say goodbye to your family Klaus. "
20356,ELENA, Stefan slow down!
20357,KLAUS," Fine, I'll send them away, you win. "
20358,ELENA, Stefan! Stefan stop!
20359,KLAUS, Stop the car Stefan! 
20360,STEFAN, Get back in the car. 
20361,ELENA, Stay away from me.
20362,STEFAN," Elena, get back in the car. "
20363,ELENA, How could you?! My parents died going over this bridge. I almost died. You knew that. You're the one who saved me. 
20364,STEFAN," Look he had to believe that I would do it alright, your fear sold it. "
20365,ELENA, What if he hadn't?
20366,STEFAN, He did. 
20367,ELENA, Well what if he hadn't?
20368,STEFAN," He did Elena! He back down! He has a weakness. If I know his weakness, I could destroy him. "
20369,ELENA," After everything, that's what matter? Destroying Klaus? "
20370,STEFAN, Destroying Klaus is all I've left. 
20371,ELENA, You had me! 
20372,STEFAN, I lost you at the minute I left town with him. You kown that you just hadn't self admit that yet. 
20373,ELENA, Is that what you are doing? Trying to make me hate you? 
20374,STEFAN, I don't really care what you think about me anymore Elena. 
20375,KLAUS," Tyler came to see me. Poor boy, he seemed quiet distressed, he said Caroline had a terrible accident."
20376,MATT, You made him do this to her. Thou he would have never done something like this.
20377,KLAUS," I'm here to help Matt. My bl*od will ill her, please ask the sheriff to invite me inside."
20378,LIZ, I know how this game works. You want something in return. 
20379,KLAUS, Just your support. 
20380,LIZ, Come in. 
20381,CAROLINE, Are you going to k*ll me?
20382,KLAUS, On your birthday? You really think that law of me?
20383,CAROLINE, Yes.
20384,KLAUS," It looks bad. My apologies, you are just colateral damages, nothing personnal. I love birthdays. "
20385,CAROLINE," Yeah, Haven't you like.. a billion, or something?"
20386,KLAUS," Well you have to adjust your perception of time when you become a vampire, Caroline. Celebrate the fact that you're no longer bond by trivial human conventions. You're free."
20387,CAROLINE," No, I'm dying."
20388,KLAUS," And I could let you die, if that's what you want. If you really believe your existence has no meaning. I thought about it myself, once or twice, over the centuries, truth will be told. But I'll let you know a little secret. There is a whole world out there, waiting for you. Great cities and art and music, genuine beauty. And you can have all of it. You can have a thousand more birthdays. All you have to do is ask. "
20389,CAROLINE, I don't wanna die. 
20390,KLAUS," Here you go, sweet heart. Have at it. "
20391,KLAUS, Happy birthday Caroline.
20392,ELENA, Thanks for picking me up.
20393,DAMON, Anytime. You're gonna be okay?
20394,ELENA, I will survive. Somehow I always do. 
20395,DAMON, You know Stefan won this round for us today. He push Klaus at the edge and Klaus blinkt.
20396,ELENA, Well his methods sucked.
20397,DAMON," Still, we needed it. Klaus have been calling on the shaft and Stefan b*at him at his own game. He was the better villain."
20398,ELENA, Don't seem so impressed.
20399,DAMON," Well, I can't help be a little proud. Really, tell me, are you gonna be okay? "
20400,ELENA, You can't kiss me again.
20401,DAMON, I know. 
20402,ELENA, I can't. It's not right. 
20403,DAMON, It's not right. Just not right now. Good night.
20404,ELENA," Good night, Damon."
20405,JEREMY," You gonna have to let me go, eventually."
20406,ELENA," Be safe, okay?"
20407,JEREMY," Yeah, okay, alright. Alaric is waiting."
20408,BONNIE," Good, you haven't left yet. "
20409,JEREMY, What are you doing here? 
20410,BONNIE, I came to say goodbye. 
20411,MATT," You're not gonna jump, are you?"
20412,ELENA," Thanks for coming. I was just thinking about what you said, about us being stuck."
20413,MATT," I was busy, Elena. I can't be responsable for jugement. "
20414,ELENA," I feel stuck, Matt. I feel like, I'd bell holding on to the girl who was supposed to die here with her parents. The girl who had a normal life, and who wasn't in love with vampires."
20415,MATT, You're not that girl anymore. It's okay if you want to let her go. 
20416,ELENA," Is it? Cause I feel like I disappointed her a little like, if I disappointed them. My parents. "
20417,MATT," For my too sense, as a guy who knew that girl, you're doing better than you think. Here lies Elena Gilbert. A girl-friend, and an amazing friend. "
20418,MEREDITH," Thanks God, another day drinker. I lost a patient, what's your excuse? "
20419,ALARIC, I put a kid on a plane.
20420,MEREDITH, Yours?
20421,ALARIC," No, it's a long story. "
20422,MEREDITH, Then you should probably buy me a beer. 
20423,LIZ, A rambler called it in. My guys got it first. 
20424,DAMON, Another hybrid? 
20425,LIZ," That's what I thought at first. Brian Walkers, the medical examiner. "
20426,DAMON," It's not a stake, he is not a vampire. "
20427,LIZ, I know. This was a m*rder. 
20428,Klaus, I figured out how to open it. Can you?
20429,Bonnie, Let me out! 
20430,Bonnie," Please! Oh, my God, oh, my God"
20431,Bonnie, Hey! I'm in here! I'm in here! I'm in here!
20432,Bonnie, I've been having these dreams for days now. It's like the witches are trying to send me a message 
20433,Elena, I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time
20434,Bonnie," Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were, Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you"
20435,Elena, So these are the rest of his family?
20436,Bonnie," Yeah, Elijah and two others"
20437,Bonnie," Now this one... Is the one we can't open. We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling methat it'll help k*ll Klaus"
20438,Stefan, What the hell are you doing?
20439,Bonnie, I needed her to know about the coffin
20440,Stefan," And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie"
20441,Elena," So what are you going to do, Stefan? Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone?"
20442,Stefan," Don't tempt me, Elena"
20443,Bonnie," I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan. And I need Elena to help me find her"
20444,Stefan, Find who? What are you talking about?
20445,Bonnie, I couldn't place her face at first
20446,Bonnie, Then I realized...
20447,Elena," Oh, my God, Bonnie "
20448,Stefan, Who is this?
20449,Bonnie, It's my mom
20450,Elena, Los alamitos?
20451,Bonnie," Um, too old"
20452,Elena, Honolulu?
20453,Bonnie," Ugh, I wish. How many of these are there?"
20454,Elena, A lot. I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country
20455,Bonnie, I know we haven't been able to really... That things have been weird because of Jeremy. So thank you for helping me with this. I know you have a lot to deal with
20456,Elena," There's nothing more important, Bonnie"
20457,Bonnie, It's surreal. Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid
20458,Elena," You know you don't have to, right? Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin. It doesn't have to fall on you"
20459,Bonnie, The coffin is spelled shut. That makes it a witch problem. So it does fall on me. I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later
20460,Damon," Sooner. Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina. Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah. A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process "
20461,Bonnie, This is her
20462,Damon, I call g*n
20463,Elena, Yeah... no
20464,Damon, Why? You don't want me to hang out in the back with you?
20465,Elena," You're not coming, Damon"
20466,Damon, Why? I'm the one who found her
20467,Elena," Ok, Damon, look, Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years. We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience"
20468,Bonnie, What's going on with you two?
20469,Damon, We kissed. Now it's weird. Have a great trip 
20470,Caroline, What are you doing here?
20471,Tyler, I came to apologize
20472,Caroline," Apologize? You bit me. I could have died. I think we're way past apologies, Tyler"
20473,Tyler," That's the problem. Klaus told me to do it and I said no. And then, it just happened anyway. Like it was completely out of my control. That's why I had your mom call him"
20474,Caroline, Daddy?
20475,Bill," Hi, Caroline"
20476,Tyler," I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist the sire bond"
20477,Caroline, Can you help him?
20478,Bill, I'm going to try
20479,Caroline, Why? 
20480,Bill, Because he made a mistake. And now he wants to make good. And I understand that
20481,Alaric, Do you want anything else? A beer?
20482,Meredith," Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes. And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor"
20483,Alaric," Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are"
20484,Meredith, Angry
20485,Alaric, Oh 
20486,Meredith, Thanks for lunch
20487,Alaric," Yeah, sure. Ah, so, um, next time, dinner?"
20488,Meredith," Yeah, that would be great"
20489,Alaric, Cool. Take care
20490,Meredith, Bye. Thanks 
20491,Damon, Who's that?
20492,Alaric, My doctor
20493,Damon, She's a doctor? Ooh. What's her damage?
20494,Alaric, No damage
20495,Damon," Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life. A girl that hot, that smart...Damage"
20496,Alaric," Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags. Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day"
20497,Damon," Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count"
20498,Alaric, I guess you're right. It's yours. I wonder what my exes would call me
20499,Damon, Nothing. They're all dead
20500,Alaric," Hmm. Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent"
20501,Damon, She dated the medical examiner?
20502,Alaric, Mm-hmm
20503,Damon," Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent. I think he's just dead"
20504,Alaric, What?
20505,Damon, m*rder. Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire 
20506,Alaric," Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that"
20507,Damon," Well, red flag number two"
20508,Alaric, Who do you think k*ll him?
20509,Damon," I don't know. But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect "
20510,Stefan," What are you doing here, Klaus?"
20511,Klaus, Enjoying our stalemate
20512,Stefan, What do you want?
20513,Klaus," Question is, what do you want? My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back"
20514,Stefan," Well, ahem, see, Klaus... I'm not negotiating"
20515,Klaus, And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
20516,Stefan," No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk "
20517,Klaus, I'm going to give you another chance. Just one more. Let's make a reasonable deal
20518,Stefan," Or what? You make one move, and I will... "
20519,Klaus," Yes, that's right. Crazy Stefan. Mmm. How's that working out for you? Any friends left?"
20520,Bonnie, I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her. Or meet her. Sort of. Since I don't really remember her
20521,Elena, You don't really talk about her
20522,Bonnie," What's to say? She left, never wrote, never called. Not even when my grams died. Can we talk about you and Damon instead?"
20523,Elena, I'm not talking about it. He kissed me. It's not going to happen again
20524,Bonnie, I mean... Was it good?
20525,Elena, It doesn't matter
20526,Bonnie, That means it was
20527,Bonnie, I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address
20528,Elena," Ignore. Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years. I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment"
20529,Bonnie," Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up"
20530,Elena, Fine
20531,Elena, What?
20532,Stefan, Where are you?
20533,Elena, Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses
20534,Stefan," You're kidding me, right?"
20535,Elena," No, Stefan, I'm not. We need a night off from your insanity"
20536,Stefan, Klaus is getting antsy. He knows I'm stalling him. We need to move faster
20537,Elena," Well, we're doing everything we can. So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?"
20538,Stefan," Sure, Elena. Whatever you say "
20539,Klaus, How's life on the road?
20540,Daniel, Scenic. How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
20541,Klaus, Boring. For now
20542,Daniel," If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word"
20543,Klaus," There's no need. I've been making friends with the town's civil servants. There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless. Are you clear on what you need to do?"
20544,Daniel, I've got it covered 
20545,Abby, Can I help you?
20546,Daniel, Abby Bennett Wilson?
20547,Abby, That's me
20548,Elena, Cute house. 
20549,Bonnie," Yeah, For the middle of nowhere "
20550,Elena, You ready? Come on
20551,Jamie, Hey there
20552,Elena," Hey, we're looking for, um, Abby Wilson"
20553,Jamie, She's not home. Is there anything I can do for you?
20554,Bonnie," That's ok, we can come back"
20555,Jamie," I'm sorry, but you look so familiar"
20556,Bonnie," Yeah, Abby's my mom "
20557,Jamie," Oh. I'm Jamie. Um, you guys want to come inside? Right this way"
20558,Jamie," You guys sure you don't want anything? We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something "
20559,Bonnie, Water's fine
20560,Jamie, Cool 
20561,Bonnie," So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
20562,Jamie," Oh, no. Uh, Abby's not my mom"
20563,Elena, Oh. Good
20564,Jamie," Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day. He was kind of a b*at, so when they broke up, she took me in. Put me through school. Didn't freak out when I totaled her car. Twice"
20565,Bonnie, She sounds...Great
20566,Jamie, Yeah 
20567,Abby, Jamie? Whose car's out front? 
20568,Bonnie, That's mine. I'm Bonnie. Your daughter
20569,Abby," Hello, Bonnie"
20570,Caroline, How do you know this is going to work?
20571,Bill," It's a process. It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion. The brain's like a muscle. The more you use it, the more it can do. A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing... Gratitude. If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why"
20572,Tyler," I was cursed. Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf. It was torture. Klaus took that away"
20573,Bill," Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him. To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn. Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free"
20574,Caroline, But how can he turn? It's not a full moon
20575,Bill," He doesn't need one. You're a hybrid now, right? I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right?"
20576,Tyler," Yeah, but I don't know how to just...Start"
20577,Bill, Now you're making excuses
20578,Tyler," You don't understand! When I turn, I break every bone in my body"
20579,Bill, You asked for my help. This is the only way. How badly do you want your freedom?
20580,Tyler, Ok. Ok
20581,Elena, How are you holding up?
20582,Bonnie," Oh. I'll be fine. I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help "
20583,Abby," So I hope you guys are hungry. 'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker"
20584,Elena, You have a really beautiful home
20585,Abby, You're so sweet. Just like your mom
20586,Elena, You knew my mom?
20587,Abby, Miranda was my best friend
20588,Bonnie, So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
20589,Abby," My best friend is why I left. 15 years ago, a vampire came to town. Looking for you, Elena. Looking for the doppelganger. No one could manage to k*ll him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him in a crypt in Charlotte"
20590,Elena, Mikael. He was an original vampire
20591,Abby, It took every ounce of power I had. Almost k*ll me. I recovered. But my magic didn't. My powers never came back
20592,Bonnie, And neither did you
20593,Abby, It wasn't that simple 
20594,Bonnie," It wasn't? You cast a spell, put Michael down, then... What? You had to teach Jamie how to drive?"
20595,Elena, Bonnie... 
20596,Bonnie," This was a mistake. She has no magic, she can't help us "
20597,Abby," Bonnie, wait, please. Don't go. Talk to me. Please?"
20598,Elena, I'll wait outside 
20599,Stefan," Hi, Elena. Nice lake house"
20600,Damon," You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell"
20601,Meredith," You're Alaric's friend, right? Damon Salvatore. Saw you at the council meeting. What are you doing here? "
20602,Damon, Strolling the halls. I like to wave at the newborns through the window. Sorry about your boyfriend. Animal attack. Brutal
20603,Meredith, Ex-boyfriend. And thanks. I'm still kind of processing
20604,Damon," Yeah, I'm sure. You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack. And then I realized. You signed the death certificate"
20605,Meredith, Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
20606,Damon," Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
20607,Meredith, Why do you even care?
20608,Damon," Because Ric likes you. And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him"
20609,Meredith, You think I k*ll my ex-boyfriend?
20610,Damon, I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance
20611,Meredith," If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch"
20612,Damon, Fair enough
20613,Tyler, I can't. I can't
20614,Bill, Try harder
20615,Caroline, Can't he just rest for one second?!
20616,Bill," We're doing this my way, Caroline. If you can't handle it, you should go"
20617,Tyler," He's right, Caroline. Just go"
20618,Tyler," Go, Caroline"
20619,Tyler, What are you doing?
20620,Tyler," What the hell, man?"
20621,Bill, Does it bother you?
20622,Tyler, Knock it off!
20623,Bill, Good. Get angry. It's in you. You know it is
20624,Tyler, I said knock it off!
20625,Bill," Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger. Now either you turn or I k*ll you right here, right now"
20626,Abby," You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie "
20627,Bonnie," Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments. I just want to know the truth... Why didn't you come home?"
20628,Abby," I had no magic. I was in a new city, and I realized I had a chance to be somebody else. To be Abby Wilson, the woman... Not Abby Bennett, the witch. I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie. I ran. I know I ran. But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it... Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am"
20629,Bonnie, You don't know? 
20630,Abby, What? 
20631,Abby, How?
20632,Bonnie, We were doing a rough spell... And we both exhausted ourselves. Her more than me
20633,Abby," Well, she raised you right. I'm sure she was very proud of you. Well, now you know my whole story"
20634,Bonnie, Yep
20635,Abby, How about you tell me yours? What brings you to me?
20636,Bonnie," It was a dream, actually. I thought you were supposed to help us. But if you don't have any magic, it's..."
20637,Abby," Well, no spells, no. But I'm not completely useless. I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such. There might be something I can do"
20638,Bonnie, I...Don't think so
20639,Abby," Bonnie, please. Let me help you "
20640,Stefan," So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out?"
20641,Elena," Honestly, I didn't care"
20642,Stefan," This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena"
20643,Elena," Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want"
20644,Stefan, Damn it!
20645,Jamie, Hey! Everything all right out here?
20646,Elena," Hey. Jamie, go back inside, ok? Please. Trust me. It's better off for you there"
20647,Jamie, I don't think so
20648,Stefan," I'd listen to her. Get back upstairs, man"
20649,Jamie, I said I don't think so
20650,Stefan," Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
20651,Elena, I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
20652,Stefan," This is the way it has to be, Elena"
20653,Elena," Oh, yeah, right. Out-villain the villain. I get it"
20654,Jamie, You're not supposed to be here
20655,Elena," Jamie, what are you doing?"
20656,Jamie, What I was told. He's not supposed to be here
20657,Stefan," Elena, he's compelled "
20658,Bonnie, What was that?! 
20659,Alaric, What are you doing here?
20660,Damon," Ah, looking for a bunny. You're good. For now"
20661,Alaric," You still obsessed with Meredith? Ah. I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
20662,Damon," Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those. You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one. Self defense and all "
20663,Alaric, What is your problem? 
20664,Damon, Your doctor vervained me. And then she bloodjacked me
20665,Alaric," What? I mean, when did you even see her?"
20666,Damon," When I went to the hospital to accuse her of k*ll her ex-boyfriend. Which, by the way, very sensitive subject"
20667,Alaric," Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
20668,Damon, Why are you mad at me? 
20669,Alaric, I told you I'd handle this! 
20670,Damon, I proved your theory... Diagnosed psycho case. You're welcome
20671,Elena, Why are you doing this?
20672,Jamie, Stop moving
20673,Elena," Jamie, let me go. Jamie, he needs help. Jamie!"
20674,Elena, Bonnie! Bonnie!
20675,Bill, Oh my God 
20676,Tyler, These chains aren't strong enough. You need to leave. Run!
20677,Daniel, So?
20678,Abby, She didn't tell me where the coffins are. The vampire showed up
20679,Daniel, Did Jamie take care of him?
20680,Abby, He did. But she's not going to talk now. There's no way. I tried
20681,Daniel," Well, you should try again "
20682,Bonnie, What did you do to me?
20683,Abby, You'll be fine. But don't try and use spells. Those herbs I used muted your magic
20684,Bonnie, Where's Elena?!
20685,Abby," She'll be fine, too. Bonnie, listen to me. I need your help. I need you to tell me where those coffins are"
20686,Bonnie, Why?
20687,Abby," Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to k*ll himself"
20688,Bonnie, I can't. This goes beyond you and me
20689,Abby," All you need to do is tell me where they are. Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain. Bonnie, please "
20690,Elena, I've almost got it
20691,Jamie, Abby hasn't called yet
20692,Elena," Jamie, please, just let us go"
20693,Jamie," No! Please, don't do anything. Look, I don't know why I sh*t him. I don't know why I'm holding this g*n, but if you move or do anything, I'm going to sh**t him again"
20694,Elena," Ok, I won't. Who gave you that g*n?"
20695,Jamie," A man came by here earlier today. He said it was wooden buckshot. Told me if anyone got in our way, I'm supposed to sh**t 'em"
20696,Elena, What else did he say? 
20697,Jamie, If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins... I'm supposed to sh**t myself
20698,Elena, What about me? What did he say about me? 
20699,Jamie, I'm not supposed to hurt you
20700,Elena, Are you sure? Because... These ropes are so tight that it is hurting me
20701,Elena, What can I do to help?
20702,Stefan," Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me. I can feel it scraping against my heart. You need to get the pieces out"
20703,Klaus," What took you so long? Hiding behind your witchy friends. And in squalor, no less "
20704,Damon, Insulting a bunch of dead witches... Not smart. I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here
20705,Klaus," Well, you know the funny thing about the witches is that living or dead, they care about their own. A hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents... And I have no problem k*ll every last one of them if I don't get my coffins back. As we speak, my hybrid friend is prepared to end the Bennett line. Now. Please... Show me the coffins"
20706,Klaus, Here we are 
20707,Klaus, Where's the fourth? Show me!
20708,Damon," Well, ehh, here's the thing. They can't. It's not here"
20709,Klaus, What did you do?
20710,Damon," Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up. I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one "
20711,Klaus," I will tear you limb from limb. And only then, when you are a writhing mass of bl*od and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest"
20712,Damon, Sorry. Same rules apply. Leverage and all. I know you want your family back. But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more 
20713,Alaric, You want to tell me what you're up to?
20714,Meredith, You talked to Damon
20715,Alaric, Yeah i did
20716,Meredith, He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon. I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours
20717,Alaric," Well, he drinks it, every day. To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him"
20718,Meredith," I'm not crazy, Ric"
20719,Alaric, Really? Then what are you?
20720,Meredith, You really want to know? Stick around
20721,Alaric, Is that bill Forbes? 
20722,Elena, Aaah! I'm just trying to help!
20723,Stefan," Just get it out, Elena, please. Just get it out"
20724,Elena," If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you"
20725,Stefan, You've changed. Something's different about you. You're stronger. Tougher
20726,Elena," You're not the only one who changed, Stefan. We all had to"
20727,Stefan, That's good to know
20728,Elena, There's something I have to tell you. And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened. It's because I feel guilty that you don't know. I kissed Damon
20729,Elena, There. All done
20730,Alaric, What happened to him?
20731,Meredith, He was found in the woods. An actual animal attack. Bite marks and gashes over half his body. Lost about 3 liters of bl*od
20732,Alaric," Well, is he going to make it?"
20733,Meredith, Nope. At least not on his own
20734,Alaric, What is that?
20735,Meredith, Exactly what you think it is. Vampire bl*od. 
20736,Meredith," You wanted to know my secret? I cheat. I'm a doctor and I hate when people die. So when I have the ability to do something about it, I do"
20737,Elena, Stefan... Say something. Please
20738,Stefan," I shouldn't have kidnapped you. The car, the bridge, it was too far"
20739,Elena, Thank you
20740,Stefan," But you shouldn't have lied to me today. You can't go off and do things like that, Elena. Not while Klaus is still alive"
20741,Elena, I know. I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way
20742,Stefan, Without me getting in the way
20743,Elena, I didn't plan on kissing him 
20744,Stefan," You're better than him, Elena. You're better than both of us "
20745,Bonnie," Elena's on her way. Jamie's safe. He's a little bruised, but he's safe"
20746,Abby, Do you think the hybrid will come back? 
20747,Bonnie, You kept your end of the bargain. Klaus usually keeps his. You're willing to do all of this for him... And he's not even your family
20748,Abby," He is my family, Bonnie. I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is. But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you. I want to help you"
20749,Bonnie, You can't. You have no magic and I don't trust you
20750,Abby," When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me. It drifted away. The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got. I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you. Maybe you can help me get my magic back"
20751,Bonnie, I thought you said you didn't want it anymore
20752,Abby, I don't. But if it's what you wanted... I would do that for you 
20753,Tyler, You're better
20754,Bill," Yeah. I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter"
20755,Tyler, I didn't mean to hurt you. I lost control. Again
20756,Bill, I knew the risks when I decided to help you. So... Was it worth it? How do you feel?
20757,Tyler, Different. A little more myself
20758,Bill, Then we'll continue tomorrow
20759,Tyler, What are you talking about? I turned
20760,Bill, Once. To break the sire bond. Turning needs to be painless. And from what I saw today... We're still a long way off
20761,Tyler, I can't put myself through that again
20762,Bill," You will. Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will, I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter"
20763,Alaric, You told me your secret. This is mine
20764,Meredith, You're a vampire hunter
20765,Alaric," Ah, semi-retired"
20766,Meredith," You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you?"
20767,Alaric, Just want to be honest. No secrets
20768,Meredith, Ok. Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck. Your injuries were fatal. Was it vampire bl*od?
20769,Alaric," That, and, uh... "
20770,Alaric, This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings
20771,Meredith, A vampire hunter who can't be k*ll by vampires. Convenient. 
20772,Meredith, Are you worried I'm a supernatural being?
20773,Alaric, One can never be... Too careful
20774,Elena," Oh, um, hey, um. Sorry"
20775,Meredith," Oh, uh, I'm gonna go"
20776,Alaric," Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure"
20777,Alaric," Elena, I am... I'm sorry"
20778,Elena," Please, it... it's ok"
20779,Alaric," Ah, it's not ok, Elena. I mean, this is not even my place. It's... it's your place. It's Jenna's place. It's your family... It's your family's place"
20780,Elena," The minute that you slept on that couch, it became your place, too. We needed you, and... And you stayed. So thank you for that. Hey, look, I know it's hard. But Jenna's gone. And you're allowed to move on"
20781,Stefan," Oh, you're still alive? I assume that means Klaus didn't get his coffins"
20782,Damon," Well, don't look so happy. I was only able to get one of them out in time. The locked one"
20783,Stefan, Probably a good choice
20784,Damon," Yeah. You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed. She doesn't"
20785,Stefan, Ah. Doesn't surprise me. It's been that kind of night
20786,Damon, Is Elena ok? 
20787,Damon, I take it you two had a heart to heart. And I take it you don't want to talk about it. Noted
20788,Damon, So why don't we talk about this?
20789,Stefan, What did you do?
20790,Daniel, You have your family back. Finally. You're going to open them?
20791,Klaus, Not quite yet. I still have some unfinished business to take care of
20792,Daniel, What business?
20793,Elijah," So, Niklaus..."
20794,Klaus, Elijah?
20795,Elijah, What did I miss?
20796,ELIJAH, You look surprised to see me. So it wasn't you that removed the dagger from my chest? 
20797,KLAUS," You look like you could do with a drink. And we have a lot to discuss, so shall we? "
20798,KLAUS," Easy. I just finished renovating. You know you have every right to be mad at me. But I kept my word, I reunited you with our family. "
20799,KLAUS, Don`t make me do this to you again Elijah! 
20800,ELIJAH, Come on. Use it. I dare you. You'll have Kol to deal with. 
20801,KLAUS, Mikael is dead. 
20802,ELIJAH, What did you say? 
20803,KLAUS, I k*ll him. With his own w*apon. He's gone Elijah. Forever. 
20804,ELIJAH," Why do our family remain in these coffins? Finn for over 900 years, Kol for over a century. "
20805,KLAUS," Because of Stefan Salvatore. He holds the one thing keeping me from freeing them. There are things that you do not know about our past, Elijah. Our mother's death. Things I never wanted you to know but I`m ready to tell you now. I only ask that you remember the oath of loyalty you once swore to me. "
20806,ELIJAH, What are you doing? 
20807,KLAUS, Always and forever. I need you to stand by my side. Be my brother. Help me destroy Stefan and I promise you our family will be whole again. 
20808,ELENA, Morning 
20809,ALARIC, Thought we had aspirin. 
20810,ELENA, Yeah in the vitamins. You`re hungover. 
20811,ALARIC," Yeah, sorry about that, it was a bit of a weird night. "
20812,ELENA, I told you you don`t have to feel guilty about inviting Meredith over here. 
20813,ALARIC, Oh I know. And I thank you for that. But I do feel guilty for whiskey dialing her at two in the a.m. 
20814,ELENA, No you didn`t. 
20815,ALARIC," Oh, yes I did. "
20816,ELENA," Oh, was she cool about it? "
20817,ALARIC," Well, as soon as these aspirin kick in and I remember the conversation, I'll let you know. "
20818,ELENA," Sheriff Forbes, hi. Is everything OK? "
20819,LIZ, This is an unconventional conversation we`re about to have. So I hope you`ll protect me on it. 
20820,ALARIC, Of course. 
20821,LIZ, I assume you both heard our medical examiner was m*rder the night of the Wickery Bridge fundraiser. 
20822,ALARIC, Yeah. Brian Walters. Why? 
20823,LIZ, We`ve been investigating. Someone drove this stake through his heart. 
20824,ALARIC, That`s one of ours. I mean this is one of a set from your parents lake house. 
20825,LIZ, That`s why I`m here. I haven`t told anyone but forensics ran it for prints and found only one clean set. 
20826,LIZ, Yours 
20827,ELENA, What? 
20828,DAMON," So you`re the prime suspect, huh? "
20829,ELENA, She doesn`t think that I did it. She`s just tryin` to find out why somebody used one of my family w*apon to k*ll a council member. 
20830,DAMON, Well why don`t you just ask Ric if his dirty little doctor had access to the w*apon. 
20831,ALARIC," You`re on speaker phone, dick. "
20832,DAMON, I`m just sayin` first suspects usually the right one. Don`t get so defensive. 
20833,ALARIC," Brian Walters was k*ll days ago, right? I didn`t show Meredith this stuff until last night! "
20834,ELENA, It wasn`t Meredith. 
20835,DAMON, But Brian Walters was her ex-boyfriend and Ric saw them fighting that night. 
20836,ELENA, It`s not Meredith! Okay? I refuse to believe that your luck with women is that tragic. 
20837,DAMON, Who else knows about your secret little slayer stash? 
20838,ALARIC," Who doesn't? Got w*apon everywhere, here, the school, my loft, your car. "
20839,DAMON," It's Klaus, it has to be, he's screwing with us. "
20840,ELENA," What if it was Stefan? He was crazy that night, and you know he was trying to get underneath Klaus's skin, he was capable of pretty much anything. "
20841,DAMON," Ahh, make's me nostalgic for the time that Stefan was a bunny snacking pacifict, anyway got to go, you'll know more later. "
20842,ALARIC," Hey, where are you? "
20843,DAMON, Tea with an old friend. 
20844,DAMON," Elijah, my favorite original, back from the dead. Clean up nice. "
20845,ELIJAH," You left something, in my jacket pocket. "
20846,DAMON," Oh, yeah. ""Dear Elijah, let's get together, plot the destruction of your brother, XOXO"" "
20847,ELIJAH, Damon. 
20848,DAMON, Was I right to undagger you or are we gonna have a problem? 
20849,ELIJAH," I'm here, let's talk. "
20850,DAMON," I'll start with an easy question, any idea what kind of Klaus k*ll w*apon could be magically sealed in a mystery coffin? "
20851,ABBY, Slow down! 
20852,STEFAN," Keep up, we don't have much time. "
20853,BONNIE," Sorry Stefan, but I didn't have a choice. "
20854,STEFAN," It was a choice Bonnie, you made it and now we have to live with it. You told Klaus where the coffins were and he took them. All of them except this one. "
20855,ABBY, That's the one that's sealed? 
20856,STEFAN, Yep. Fortunately it seems to be the one he cares about most. 
20857,ABBY, Aren't you coming inside? 
20858,STEFAN, Vampires can't get in. Damon had to compelled a couple of Lockwood-Gardeners to bring the coffin in. 
20859,Abby, This is a bad idea. 
20860,Stefan," Look, if you're really the key to opening up that coffin, I think it's a pretty save bet you're on Klaus's hitlist.So I suggest you hideout here and figure out a way to open up the damn thing. "
20861,Abby," I told you, I don't have any powers. "
20862,Stefan," And I don't believe you. The time's ticking. Won't be long, before Klaus calls his hybrids to find that coffin and k*ll all of us. So dig deep, Abby Bennett. Scrape out whatever magic you have left. "
20863,Stefan, What are you doing here? 
20864,Elena, Bonnie told me that you guys would be here. I need to talk to you. 
20865,Stefan," Well, there's nothing to talk about. I'm just focused on getting this coffin open. "
20866,Elena, Did you k*ll the medical examiner? 
20867,Stefan, Why would you think I did that? 
20868,Elena, Maybe because I don't know what you're capable of anymore. 
20869,Stefan," Well, believe what you want, Elena. "
20870,Elena," I don't want to believe any of it, Stefan. "
20871,Stefan, But you had to ask me anyway. 
20872,Elena, Stefan... 
20873,Stefan, Did you ask Damon... if he k*ll anybody lately? 
20874,Meredith, Are you Caroline? 
20875,Caroline," Yes. Dr. Fell, hi. Elena told me you helped out my dad. "
20876,Meredith, I did. Do you think you can get him to be a little more grateful? He spent half the night threatening to get my medical license revoked for saving his life. 
20877,Caroline," Yeah, my dad's a little set in his ways. He spent his whole life hating vampires, so... "
20878,Meredith," So... he's not psyched about it being vampire bl*od that healed him. Yeah, he made that clear. I'm sorry. my bedside manner sucks, on no sleep. "
20879,Caroline," So, can I take him home? "
20880,Meredith," I signed his discharge papers late last night, just to shut him up. "
20881,Caroline," Oh, I... he didn't call or anything. "
20882,Meredith," That's gotta be hard. When your dad hates the one thing you can't change about yourself. I make it my business, to know who the vampires are in this town. Medical curiosity. I don't blab. "
20883,Caroline," Yeah, we've had our ups and downs. "
20884,Meredith, Tell your dad I said you're welcome. 
20885,Caroline, Thanks. 
20886,Elena, That was fast. 
20887,Caroline," Yeah, he's not here. He was already discharged. And she seems perfectly nice by the way... a little intense, maybe. But... I think it's sweet, you wanna make sure Alaric's not dating a total psycho. "
20888,Elena, He's my family. I have to look out for him. What? 
20889,Caroline, I hear it. 
20890,Elena, Hear what? 
20891,Caroline, My dad's phone. 
20892,Caroline, Dad! Dad? 
20893,Elena, Oh my god. 
20894,Caroline," Don't be dead, don't be dead, don't be dead! Oh my god! "
20895,Caroline, Daddy! 
20896,Elena, Caroline... He has vampire bl*od in his system. 
20897,Caroline, What?! 
20898,Bonnie, Is this the only grimoire you kept? 
20899,Abby, It was the only one I needed. So... what is all of this? 
20900,Bonnie," Family history. About a mother, who loved her children so much, she couldn't bear the thought she might lose them. So she turned them into vampires. One of them is Klaus. "
20901,Abby," The one, you're trying to k*ll with whatever is in that coffin? "
20902,Bonnie," There's nothing in here, that's going to help us. I've seen most of these spells. What was this? "
20903,Abby, That was the spell I used to seal Mikael in the tomb. I b*rned it and tried to get it out of my head. Didn't work though. Wait... Do you see this? 
20904,Bonnie, It's a sealing spell. We're trying to open something... Not seal it shut. 
20905,Abby," No. Right here. On this side. It's a bl*od knot. It means, to bind it you need two genarations. A bloodline. Like... two keys to a safety deposit box. "
20906,Bonnie," So... unbinding it, would reverse the spell. Unseal it. If we did it together. "
20907,Damon, Get dressed. We're going out. 
20908,Stefan," Yeah, sorry, not interested. "
20909,Damon, I didn't ask. Elijah and I have scheculed a very old fashion sitdown with you and Klaus. I say go with the black. Makes you look all villainy. 
20910,Stefan," Klaus won't make a deal, Damon. "
20911,Damon, He didn't have to. All we're doing is buying a little time to give our wicked witches a chance to pop-up the top of the coffin. 
20912,Stefan," So, that's your...uh...plan? Stall Klaus? "
20913,Damon, If you didn't go postal on his hybrids then maybe we'd have some options. 
20914,Stefan, So you unleashed an original to help him out? 
20915,Damon," Undaggering Elijah was smart, Stefan. You're kidding me? After what Klaus did to him? He's in vengeance mood. Perfect. "
20916,Stefan," There's nothing smart... about trusting Elijah, Damon. He screwed us over the last time he promised to help us k*ll Klaus. "
20917,Damon," Yeah, the way you've been acting I trust him about as much as I trust you. "
20918,Stefan," Hm. Well I guess that goes both ways, doesn't it? "
20919,Damon," Oh yes this is aboout me kissing Elena. Just remember; if it wasn't for Klaus, you would have never become such a dick and that kiss would never have happened. So get ready and get happy. We're going to negotiate a fake truce and I don't want your attitude screwing it up. "
20920,Caroline, I compelled the nurse to stay out of this room. You'll be safe here. 
20921,Bill, My wound is completely healed. I need something to eat. 
20922,Caroline," Daddy, why don't you just come lay down and just relax? "
20923,Bill, I can't. I'm too wired and my pulse is racing. It's the effect of my body wanting to transition. 
20924,Caroline," Well, maybe Doctor Fell can give you something. "
20925,Bill, She's done enough. 
20926,Elena, I called your mom. 
20927,Caroline, Thanks. 
20928,Elena," Mr. Forbes, did you see your attacker? "
20929,Bill, I didn't see anything. Tried to sneak out the back exit and someone came up from behind. 
20930,Caroline," Look, we'll figure this out, but in the mean time we need to get you some bl*od. "
20931,Bill, I'm not going to drink any bl*od. 
20932,Elena, You have to. You died with vampire bl*od in your system. If you don't feed and finish the transition into a vampire then you'll die. 
20933,Bill, I understand how it works. And that's what I'm prepared to do. Now get me out of this hospital. I smell bl*od everywhere. 
20934,Elena, What are you doing? 
20935,Alaric, Taking inventory. Did you bring it? 
20936,Elena," You mean, did I steal evidence from a crime scene? Yes. "
20937,Alaric," You're right. It's a match. This is from a crawl space in the foyer. Which means, Meredith knew where it was. "
20938,Elena," That doesn't mean, she stole it. "
20939,Alaric, This is from the loft. These are from the duffel in Damon's car. 
20940,Elena, Identical to the one that k*ll Brian Walters. 
20941,Alaric," Damon's car was at the Wickery-Bridge fundraiser, so was Meredith. And that was the night her ex-boyfriend, the medical examiner, was k*ll. The one who called her psycho. "
20942,Elena," Well, she was trying to save Bill Forbes, why would she turn around and try to k*ll him? "
20943,Alaric," I don't know what to think either. You know, but... we'd be idiots to ignore all these facts. "
20944,Elena, So what should we do? 
20945,Alaric, Well... Get this to the police. Then you should probably be with Caroline. 
20946,Elena," I'm sorry, Ric. Please be careful. "
20947,Elijah," Niklaus, our guests have arrived. "
20948,Klaus," Damon. Stefan. Elijah tells me, you seek an audience. Very bold. Let's discuss the terms of our agreement like civilised men, shall we? "
20949,Elijah, It's better to indulge him. 
20950,Stefan," I didn't come here to eat, Klaus. Fact, I didn't want to come here at all. But I was told, I had to cause you would hear us out. "
20951,Klaus," Well, we can sit and eat or I can reach down your throats and pull out your insides. The choice is yours. "
20952,Damon," Thank you, love. "
20953,Klaus, You lost your appetite. 
20954,Damon, Eat. I thought we agreed that we would leave the grumpy Stefan at home. 
20955,Klaus, That's the spirit. Isn't it nice? Four of us dining together? Such a treat. Is this what you had in mind when you pulled the dagger from my brother? 
20956,Damon," Well, I know how he felt about you, so I figured the more, the merrier. "
20957,Klaus," Well, Elijah and I have had our share of quarrels over the century. But we always make it through. "
20958,Stefan," Kind of like you and Rebekah, right? Where is she, by the way? Last I checked she was still daggered because you were afraid to face her. "
20959,Klaus," If you're referring to the fact that Rebekah knows I k*ll our mother, I've already come clean to Elijah. "
20960,Damon," Hey, Stef, remember when you k*ll dad? Might want to dial down the judgment until dessert. "
20961,Stefan," We're here to make a deal, Damon. Doesn't mean we need to kiss his ass for seven courses. "
20962,Damon, I'm just saying we have a long evening ahead of us. Pace yourself. 
20963,Elena, Did you hear back from Tyler yet? 
20964,Caroline," No. And I've left messages for him everywhere. So, does Alaric really think that Dr. Fell did it? "
20965,Elena, He doesn't know what to think. 
20966,Caroline, What about you? 
20967,Elena," I wish the girl Alaric liked wasn't in the middle of all of this. He deserves to be happy. But yeah, she looks guilty. It's why I told your mom. "
20968,Caroline, My mom's in there sitting with my dad. And I don't think they've been in the same room this long since I was ten years old. Is there any chance that Tyler did it? 
20969,Elena, What? 
20970,Caroline," If Klaus was trying to mess with you and he's sired to Klaus. And, I mean, he does everything that he's told. "
20971,Elena," No... no, I don't think Tyler did it. "
20972,Caroline," I can't just let my father die. You know, I'm... I'm gonna force him to feed. "
20973,Elena," Hey... he doesn't want to, Caroline. The only thing your dad has is his choice. "
20974,Caroline, I hated him so much for what he did to me. So much. Now all I want to do is save his life. 
20975,Elena," Of course you do, he's your dad. "
20976,Caroline, What was the hardest part for you? When you lost your Dad? 
20977,Elena," Realizing all the things that he wouldn't be there for. The things that... that you just need your Dad for, you know? "
20978,Matt, Hey. 
20979,Caroline, Hey. 
20980,Elijah, Stefan. Where is the lovely Elena tonight? 
20981,Stefan, I don't know. Ask Damon. 
20982,Klaus," I'm sorry, you've missed so much. Uh- trouble in paradise. "
20983,Stefan, One more word about Elena and this dinner's over. 
20984,Damon," You know what, probably best just to keep Elena in the do not discuss pile. "
20985,Klaus, You're probably right. 
20986,Damon, Yeah. 
20987,Klaus," It's just the allure of the Petrova doppelgänger, still so strong. What do you say, brother? Should we tell them about Tatia? "
20988,Elijah, Now why should we discuss matters long since resolved? 
20989,Klaus," Well, given their shared affection for both Elena and Katerina, I think our guests might be curious to learn about the originator of the Petrova line. "
20990,Damon," Well, we're not going anywhere Elijah. Please, do tell. "
20991,Elijah," When our family first settled here, there was a girl named Tatia, she was an exquisite beauty. Every boy of age desired to be her suitor, even though she'd had a child by another man. And none loved her more than Niklaus. "
20992,Klaus, I'd say there was one who loved her at least as much. 
20993,Stefan," Wait a minute, so you both loved the same girl? "
20994,Elijah," Our mother was a very powerful witch. She sought to end our feud over Tatia and so she took her. Klaus and I would later learn that it was Tatia's bl*od that we consumed in the wine on the night where our mother performed the spell which turned us into vampires. Tatia wouldn't make a decision between the two of us, so for a time Niklaus and I... grew estranged. Harsh words were traded, we even came to blows, didn't we, brother? "
20995,Klaus, But in the end we realized the sacred bond of family. 
20996,Elijah, Family above all. 
20997,Klaus, Family above all. 
20998,Bonnie, You're not trying! We've been at this for over an hour. 
20999,Abby, The spirits are angry with me. For leaving you. Maybe they didn't want me to have my powers again. 
21000,Bonnie," I had all of those dreams for a reason. The spirits wanted me to find you because your my mom. It's not them, it's you. You won't open yourself up to it. You know, Dad never talked about you? And neither did Grams. I had no memories of you. So you know what I use to pretend? That you were dead. It was easier to do that than to wonder why you never came back for me. "
21001,Abby, There is no way I can tell you how sorry I am for what I did. 
21002,Bonnie, Yes there is. You can help me. 
21003,Bonnie," It almost worked. I have to call Damon, tell him that we're getting closer. I'll be right back. "
21004,Abby, Okay. 
21005,Elijah," So, why don't we move this evening along and discuss the terms of this proposal? "
21006,Damon," That's very simple. Klaus gets his coffin back, in exchange, he and the Original extended family leave Mystic Falls forever. Me, Stefan, and Elena live happily ever after. No grudges. "
21007,Elijah," The deal sounds fair, brother. "
21008,Klaus," I don't think you understand, Elena's doppelgänger bl*od insures that I will always have more hybrids to fight those that oppose me. I will never leave her behind. "
21009,Klaus," Let's say I do leave her here, under your protection, what then? How long before one of you turns her into a vampire? Or worse, how long before she dies caught between your feuding? You see, each one of you truly believes that you're the one that can protect her, and that is simply a delusion. Gentlemen, the worst thing for Elena Gilbert is... the two of you. "
21010,Damon, I'm gonna get some air. 
21011,Elijah, Let me deal with this. 
21012,Klaus, All this talk has made me thirsty. 
21013,Klaus," What do you say Stefan, can I interest you in a little after dinner drink? "
21014,Elena, Thanks for walking me home. 
21015,Matt, Are you doing okay? This has to bring up a lot for you. 
21016,Elena, We've all lost a lot. 
21017,Matt," It's this town, it's messed up. None of us should have to live this way. "
21018,Elena, That's weird. 
21019,Matt, Electricity must be out. 
21020,Elena, Here. 
21021,Elena, I think I have some candles over there. 
21022,Elena, Oh my God! 
21023,Matt, What the hell? 
21024,Elena, Matt? 
21025,Elena," Ric! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! "
21026,Matt," No, leave it in! Leave it in! He's lost too much bl*od. I'm gonna call 911. "
21027,Elena," Ric, look at me. Who did this to you? "
21028,Alaric, I don't know. 
21029,Elena," Oh my God, there's a lot of bl*od, Matt! "
21030,Matt," I know, I know, Elena. I know. "
21031,Alaric, You have to k*ll me. 
21032,Elena, What? 
21033,Alaric," Elena, you- you have to k*ll me. "
21034,Elena," Wait, wait, wait, Matt, hang up, hang up. He's right. If he dies a supernatural death, then he'll come back to life and he'll be healed. "
21035,Matt," But, how do you know who did this is supernatural? "
21036,Elena," That's what he's saying, we don't but... I'm the doppelgänger. "
21037,Elena, That makes me supernatural. 
21038,Matt," Elena! No, this is messed up! "
21039,Elena," He's dying, Matt! "
21040,Klaus, Delicious. Aged to perfection. 
21041,Stefan," Well, I guess the only reason you agreed to this evening, Klaus, is to drive a wedge between me and my brother. "
21042,Klaus," Oh no, you're doing that well enough on your own. Because of Elena, you're gonna lose your brother and you'll only have yourself to blame. "
21043,Damon," What do you say, Klaus? It's time for you to put something on the table. We've made our offer, now you counter. "
21044,Klaus," Okay. I offer Elena's future happiness. You see, what she needs right now is to be rid of you lot. And to fall in love with a human, maybe that nice football player, you know the blond one? "
21045,Damon, Matt Donovan? Really? 
21046,Klaus," Yeah, why not? They'll marry, live a long and fruitful life, and pop out a perfect family. "
21047,Stefan," And continue the Petrova bloodline. Every few hundred years, you'll have a new doppelgänger to drain and never run out of hybrids, right Klaus? "
21048,Klaus," Consider it a small return on my investment in her well being. See after you hand me back the coffin, I'll ensure her safety for the rest of her natural life, you know it's what's best for her. "
21049,Klaus," So, what do you say Stefan, do we have a deal? "
21050,Damon, What are you doing? 
21051,Stefan," Nice try, Klaus. But no deal. "
21052,Damon, What are you doing? 
21053,Damon, Stop! 
21054,Klaus," Now, bring me my coffin before I burn him alive. "
21055,Damon, I'll get it. 
21056,Klaus," Go with him, brother, you keep him honest. And when you return, I will make good on my promise to you and I will hand over our family. "
21057,Bill, Hey. 
21058,Caroline, Hey. 
21059,Bill, Your first day at regionals. 
21060,Caroline," Yep. I was afraid to join the squad, but you talked me into it. "
21061,Bill," You had nothing to be afraid of, you were so much better than all those other girls. "
21062,Caroline, How are you feeling? 
21063,Bill, I'm tired. 
21064,Caroline, Can I get you anything? Or um... do you want me to call Steven? 
21065,Bill," No, no, we haven't spoken in a while. Just call him when it's over and the dust is settled, would you? "
21066,Caroline," Listen, listen to me. I know that you think you made your choice, but you can change your mind. You know, you are strong enough to handle being a vampire. I mean, you're the strongest person that I know. "
21067,Bill," Oh, Caroline, my strength is all in my beliefs. Becoming a vampire is wrong, people aren't supposed to cheat death, it's just what I believe. Please respect that. "
21068,Caroline, God. How can you hate who I am so much?! 
21069,Bill," Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart, I don't hate you, I love you. You're strong, you're beautiful, you're good. And even after everything that has happened to you, you are exactly who your mother and I hoped you'd grow up to be. "
21070,Caroline," Please don't leave me, Daddy. Please... please don't leave me. Daddy just don't leave me. "
21071,Bill," Shh. Parents aren't supposed to outlive their children, Caroline. It's okay. "
21072,Bill, This is life. This is what it means to be human. 
21073,Stefan," Go ahead and k*ll me, I know you'll do it when he brings the coffin. "
21074,Klaus," You really have given up, haven't you? Where's the fight? Where's the ripper? "
21075,Klaus, Elijah... why haven't you left? 
21076,Elijah," Where are you manners, brother? We forgot dessert. "
21077,Klaus, What have you done? 
21078,Elijah," What have you done? You see I've learned not to trust your vulgar promises, Klaus. We're doing this on my terms now. "
21079,Klaus, Kol. 
21080,Kol," Long time, brother. "
21081,Klaus," Finn, don't! "
21082,Klaus, Rebekah? 
21083,Rebekah, This is for our mother. 
21084,Elijah, You're free to go. This is family business. 
21085,Matt, He's still out? 
21086,Elena, Caroline called. Her dad died. Will you stay with me? Until he wakes up? 
21087,Matt, Of course. 
21088,Elena, I can't lose anymore family. 
21089,Stefan," Ah, you were right about Elijah. Undaggering him was a smart move. "
21090,Damon," Wow, actual acknowledgement of a job well done. You're going soft, Stefan. "
21091,Stefan," So, I guess I shouldn't thank you for saving me from Klaus? "
21092,Damon," Shut up, you don't get to thank me until I pay you back for all those times you've saved me. "
21093,Stefan, You could have left me there. Klaus would have k*ll me and you would have had Elena all to yourself. 
21094,Damon, I didn't do it on your account. 
21095,Stefan," I love her, Damon. "
21096,Damon, So do I. 
21097,Liz," I looked into it, Elena. Meredith Fell was called into surgery six hours ago. She's been in there ever since. "
21098,Elena, She has an alibi? 
21099,Liz, Iron-tight in an operating room full of witnesses. 
21100,Elena, Then who could it be? 
21101,Liz, I don't know. But the attack on Alaric makes this the third member of the Founder's Council and we just cleared our only suspect. 
21102,Damon, Let's hope big witch and little witch got that coffin open. 
21103,Stefan, Something's gotta make this night worthwhile. 
21104,Stefan, Bonnie? She's still breathing. 
21105,Damon," Mama's still breathing, I can hear her. "
21106,Stefan, Coffin's open. 
21107,Damon," Well, it's not gonna do us any good. Whatever's in it is gone. "
21108,Rebekah," I like what you've done with the new place, Nik. "
21109,Klaus, I wanted it to be for all of us. A place we could all call home. A place we could all be a family. None of us would ever have to be alone again. 
21110,Elijah," Well you're right, none of us will be. "
21111,Finn, You're staying behind. 
21112,Rebekah," We're leaving you, Nik. Right after I k*ll that doppelgänger wench, then you will be alone. Always and forever. "
21113,Klaus," If you run, I will hunt all of you down. "
21114,Elijah, Then you'll become everything you hate. Our father. 
21115,Klaus, I'm the hybrid! I can't be k*ll! I have nothing to fear from any of you. 
21116,Elijah, You will when we have that coffin. 
21117,Rebekah, Mother? 
21118,Esther, Look at me! Do you know why I'm here? 
21119,Klaus, You're here to k*ll me. 
21120,Esther," Niklaus, you are my son and I am here to forgive you. I want us to be a family again."
21121,Matt, How's Mr. Saltzman?
21122,Elena," Resigned to spending the night in observation, so long as I promise to change the lock on the house. So I talked with Bonnie earlier. Her and her mom are fine"
21123,Elena, Have you talked to Caroline?
21124,Matt," Yeah. She's holding it together, considering how close she and her dad used to be. Any word on who was behind all these attacks?"
21125,Elena, No. Sheriff Forbes said that there's no real suspects at all.
21126,Elena," How are you dealing with everything? I mean, you keep getting dragged into all this"
21127,Matt, Honestly... I'm kind of lucky. The only thing that I have to worry about for tomorrow is showing up for my shift at the Grill
21128,Elena, Thank you for everything today. Really
21129,Matt, Get home safe
21130,Elena, Thanks
21131,Rebekah, What? Drive much?
21132,Elena, Rebekah...
21133,Rebekah," Surprised? You drove a dagger through my back, Elena. It hurt"
21134,Rebekah, Elijah
21135,Elijah, Leave
21136,Elijah, Are you challenging me?
21137,Rebekah, You're pathetic
21138,Rebekah, Both of you
21139,Elijah, Well... I believe we have a little catching up to do
21140,Elena, It was their mother Esther who was sealed in that coffin
21141,Stefan, As in the original witch?
21142,Damon, What? How is she even alive? I thought her hybrid freak show of a son ripped her heart out a thousand years ago
21143,Elena," I don't know. I'm guessing she has a couple of connections in the witching community. Elijah said that she wants to live in peace with her family, including Klaus"
21144,Stefan, She was supposed to be the w*apon to help us k*ll Klaus
21145,Elena," Yeah, well, not anymore. At least, not according to Elijah"
21146,Stefan, That coffin was the only thing stopping Klaus from tearing us to shreds
21147,Damon, Anyone else feeling a little used right now?
21148,Elena," Look, Elijah promised me that his family wouldn't hurt any of us. I believe him"
21149,Damon, What is it?
21150,Elena, It's an invitation
21151,Elena," ""Please join the Mikaelson family this evening at seven o'clock for dancing, cocktails, and celebration."""
21152,Stefan, Who the hell are the Mikaelsons?
21153,Elena, The original family
21154,Damon, It's not bad enough they're moving into town. Now they want a housewarming gift?
21155,Elena," Wait. There's a note on the back. ""Elena, I think it's time we finally meet. Esther"""
21156,Kol," Rebekah, tell me how handsome I am"
21157,Rebekah," Ah, Kol, you know I can't be compelled"
21158,Klaus, You went after Elena? What is wrong with you?
21159,Rebekah, Here we go
21160,Klaus, Do you want another dagger in your heart?
21161,Kol, Again with the dagger threats? Don't you have any other tricks?
21162,Klaus," Oh, go back to staring at yourself"
21163,Kol," And who are you, my father?"
21164,Klaus," No, Kol, but you're in my house"
21165,Kol, Then perhaps we should go outside
21166,Esther," Enough! Niklaus, come"
21167,Klaus," Rebekah wasn't even out of her box a day before she tried to ruin my life. What happened to peace, acceptance, family?"
21168,Esther, You put daggers in their hearts. You want them to go down on their knees and kiss your feet for reuniting them?
21169,Klaus, So it's a crime to want our family to be as we were?
21170,Esther," You need to give it time, Niklaus. I've had a thousand years on the other side to be angry and to heal. I'm here to make sure this family does the same"
21171,Klaus," I just don't understand. I k*ll you, and still you forgive me"
21172,Esther," It's been my dream for a thousand years that this family could be as one. Forgiveness is not a chore. It's a gift. Now, who are you bringing to the ball this evening?"
21173,Klaus, Don't be ridiculous. You're lucky I'm even going
21174,Esther," Well, I wish you would reconsider. It's going to be a magical evening"
21175,Elena," If Esther wants to talk to me, maybe I should find out why"
21176,Damon," Well, that's a dumb idea. She already tried to k*ll you once"
21177,Stefan," No, Elena's right. Bonnie was led to open that coffin for a reason. I think there's more to this than just some family reunion"
21178,Damon, Can we go back in time to the old Stefan who cared if Elena lived or died?
21179,Stefan, What for? That's your job now
21180,Elena," Stefan has a point, Damon. I should find out what she wants"
21181,Damon, You can't protect yourself
21182,Stefan," Ok, fine. Then I'll go"
21183,Damon, You pissed off enough originals to last a lifetime. I'll go
21184,Elena, Hey!
21185,Damon, End of story
21186,Tyler," Caroline, it's Tyler. I know I should have called sooner. I just kind of freaked out and left. But I heard about your dad, and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Caroline. I'm out doing what he said. I'm going to fix myself and come home to you. I love you "
21187,Caroline, Seriously?
21188,Elena," It's all so weird. The originals are throwing a ball, like an actual ball"
21189,Caroline, It's some twisted Cinderella fetish is what it is. And why does the evil witch wants an audience with you?
21190,Elena, I have no idea. There's only one way to find out
21191,Caroline, I thought you told Damon and Stefan that you weren't going
21192,Elena," I did, which is all the more reason why I need a drama-free bodyguard"
21193,Caroline," Well, I think a Salvatore would look a lot better in a tux, and by that, I mean Stefan"
21194,Elena," I can't deal with either of the Salvatores right now. Whatever Stefan's feeling, he's channeling it all against Klaus, and Damon... it's just not a good idea"
21195,Caroline, Why? 'Cause you two made out? Bonnie spilled the beans
21196,Elena, I was gonna tell you. It's just after everything happened with your dad...
21197,Caroline," Elena, when you and Matt kissed for the first time freshman year, you called me the second it happened. I don't hear about this till now? From somebody else?"
21198,Elena, I'm sorry. It's just I... I don't even know how I feel about it yet. All I do know is that... Just used to be so much easier
21199,Rebekah," Careful, Caroline. It's all well and good till she stabs you in the back"
21200,Elena, What are you doing here? I know your mom's rules. No hurting the locals
21201,Rebekah," Get over yourself, Elena. It's not all about you"
21202,Caroline," Oh, my god. She's inviting him to the ball. Why is she inviting him?"
21203,Elena, Probably to get this reaction from us
21204,Caroline, What time is this stupid dance?
21205,Damon," Hello, Carol"
21206,Carol, Hello
21207,Damon, Hanging out with your new besties?
21208,Carol," I'm the mayor, Damon. When the oldest, deadliest family of vampires moves into your town, you welcome them with a smile"
21209,Damon," Well, at least you know who you're borrowing that cup of sugar from"
21210,Carol," They've assured me they want peace, and I've assured them that I'd enforce it"
21211,Kol, Mayor Lockwood. We haven't formally met. Kol Mikaelson. I hope your lovely town embraces us just as much as we plan to embrace it
21212,Damon, Damon Salvatore. Have we met?
21213,Kol," I've met a lot of people, And you don't particularly stand out"
21214,Damon, Excuse me Carol
21215,Stefan, What are you doing here?
21216,Elena, I could ask you the same thing
21217,Damon," Surprise, surprise. Nice tux"
21218,Damon, You're not supposed to be here
21219,Elena," Well, I am, And I'm not leaving until I find out what Esther wants, so shall we?"
21220,Klaus, Good evening
21221,Caroline, I need a drink
21222,Finn," Elena Gilbert, I presume. I'm Finn Mikaelson. You're here to see my mother"
21223,Elena, Is she here?
21224,Finn, Her request did not include your friends
21225,Elena," They're protecting me. You may not know, but your mother's already tried to k*ll me once"
21226,Finn," If you want to see my mother, you'll need to be alone"
21227,Elijah," Uh, if everyone could gather, please "
21228,Finn, Excuse me
21229,Elijah," Welcome. Thank you for joining us. You know, whenever my mother brings our family together like this, it's tradition for us to commence the evening with a dance"
21230,Damon, Do you see who I see?
21231,Stefan," Oh, yeah"
21232,Elijah," Tonight's pick is a centuries-old waltz, so if all of you could please find yourselves a partner, please join us in the ballroom"
21233,Damon, Don't even think about it
21234,Elena," She wants to see me alone, Damon"
21235,Damon," Well, it sucks to be her, then. Was I not clear this morning?"
21236,Elena, I was invited
21237,Damon, You have to tell me before you walk into a lion's den
21238,Elena, Why? So that you can stop me?
21239,Damon, Yes
21240,Damon," It would be rude not to dance, you know"
21241,Elena, It is tradition
21242,Damon," You look stunning, if it isn't obvious"
21243,Elena, Thank you
21244,Klaus, I'm glad you came
21245,Caroline," Well, it was either caviar or sympathy casseroles"
21246,Klaus, I heard about your father
21247,Caroline, Don't. Seriously
21248,Klaus," Very well. On to more mannered subjects then, like how ravishing you look in that dress"
21249,Caroline, I didn't really have time to shop
21250,Klaus," And the bracelet I gave you, what's your excuse for wearing that? You know, you're quite the dancer"
21251,Caroline," Well, I've had training. I happen to be miss Mystic Falls"
21252,Klaus, i know
21253,Elena," He dances, and I didn't even have to beg"
21254,Stefan," Well, mayor Lockwood dragged me out here. Couldn't exactly say no"
21255,Caroline, What are you doing? Why are you here with the she devil?
21256,Matt," What was I supposed to say, no? And why the hell are you here with Klaus?"
21257,Caroline, Don't even get me started
21258,Stefan, Took you about 30 seconds to put Damon in a mood
21259,Elena, He's just looking out for me
21260,Stefan, I think he needs to figure out that you can look out for yourself
21261,Elena, I need to talk to you
21262,Stefan," Ok, so talk"
21263,Elena, I... not here
21264,Damon, Stop staring. It's creepy
21265,Rebekah, Of course she looks beautiful. Nik gave her everything she's wearing
21266,Damon," Well, you're no dog yourself"
21267,Rebekah, Was that supposed to be a compliment?
21268,Damon, You tried to k*ll Elena last night. You don't get compliments
21269,Rebekah, Caveman
21270,Damon, Where is Elena?
21271,Elena," If Esther's secretly on our side, we need to know, but I can't get to her with 2 bodyguards"
21272,Stefan, Why are you telling me this?
21273,Elena," Because Damon won't let me anywhere near her without protection, and you care about k*ll Klaus more than you care about anything, so... What? Am I wrong?"
21274,Stefan," No, you're not wrong. What do you need me to do?"
21275,Elena, Make sure that I can get into that room with Esther alone
21276,Stefan, You sure you can do this?
21277,Elena," I can do this. When we were together, you used to let me make my own decisions. You trusted me. After all this, at least that hasn't changed"
21278,Kol, Where's your date?
21279,Rebekah, Flirting with his ex
21280,Kol," You've changed, Becca. You know, settling for mortals is the first sign of weakness"
21281,Rebekah," I'm not settling. I brought him here to k*ll him. He's Elena's friend. If he dies, she suffers. But I've already been scolded once, so I was hoping you'd help your baby sister out"
21282,Kol, And spit right in the face of mother's rules? I'm in
21283,Damon, I got your text
21284,Damon, What are we doing in here?
21285,Stefan," Well, better hurry up. Won't be down for long"
21286,Elijah, Elena. I understand my mother requested to see you
21287,Elena," Uh, yeah. Why? Is something wrong?"
21288,Elijah," Well, her ability to forgive my brother after everything he's done to destroy this family strikes me as a little strange to say the least"
21289,Elena, Do you think that it's an act?
21290,Elijah, It has me asking questions I never thought I'd ask. Can I depend on you to tell me what she says?
21291,Elena," Of course. I'll find you later, ok?"
21292,Esther, That'll be the girl
21293,Finn, You're alone. Wise choice
21294,Esther," It's only sage. I've spelled it so we can speak freely without fear of being overheard. That'll be all, Finn. Thank you"
21295,Esther," You must have a million questions for me, Elena. Please"
21296,Elena, How are you alive? Are you a ghost or...
21297,Esther," Not exactly. When I died, the witch Ayana preserved my body with a spell. She was a close friend of mine, an ancestor of your friend Bonnie"
21298,Elena, So that's why only Bonnie and her mother could open up the casket. They complete the Bennett bloodline
21299,Esther," I drew power from them and their ancestors, who were with me on the other side"
21300,Elena, So you've been on the other side for a thousand years?
21301,Esther, Nature's way of punishing me for turning my family into vampires. But there is a way for me to undo the evil I created
21302,Elena," You're here to help us k*ll Klaus, aren't you?"
21303,Esther," One thing at a time, Elena. For now, I simply need your help"
21304,Klaus, You like horses?
21305,Caroline, I'm not talking to you until you tell me why you invited me here
21306,Klaus, I fancy you. Is that so hard to believe?
21307,Caroline, Yes
21308,Klaus, Why? You're beautiful. You... you're strong. You're full of light. I enjoy you
21309,Caroline," Well, I'm spoken for. By Tyler"
21310,Klaus, I thought you two ended things
21311,Caroline," Yeah, because of you and your freaky sire bond with him"
21312,Klaus," So you aren't spoken for. You know, horses are the opposite of people. They're loyal. My father hunted me for a thousand years, and the closest he ever came was the day he k*ll my favorite horse. He... he severed its neck with a sword as a warning"
21313,Caroline, Did you ever consider sitting down with your father and talking it out?
21314,Klaus, I'm afraid my relationship with my father was a little more complex than yours
21315,Caroline," Maybe so. But I let my father go with no regrets. And to answer your question, yes, I like horses, but I also like people, and they actually like me. So I'll be inside"
21316,Esther, I understand Rebekah shared the story of my family... How I upset the balance of nature by turning my children into vampires
21317,Elena, She said you did it to protect them from the werewolves
21318,Esther," It's true. But in no time at all, they began to feed on human bl*od. They ravaged the town with no remorse. Eventually Niklaus turned against me"
21319,Elena, How are you gonna k*ll him? He's immortal
21320,Esther," It will take time, magic, and your assistance"
21321,Elena, What do I have to do with it?
21322,Esther," My children believe I'm holding this to celebrate our reunion. But in truth, I've gathered them together to perform a ritual. The first step requires bl*od from a doppelganger.Only a drop. Its essence will be in the champagne toast later on this evening"
21323,Esther, Will you do it? Or shall I?
21324,Esther," Elijah is more suspicious than the others, so he may need more persuasion, but they must all drink at the toast in order to be linked as one"
21325,Elena," What do you mean ""linked as one""?"
21326,Esther," You said yourself Klaus can't be k*ll, but tonight's spell links all of my children together so that if one goes, they all go"
21327,Elena, What?
21328,Esther," I love my family, Elena, but they are an abomination. I betrayed nature when I created them. It's my duty to k*ll them"
21329,Kol, I'm itching to k*ll something. What are we waiting for?
21330,Rebekah, The mayor cornered me. Give me 15 minutes to lure Matt outside
21331,Kol, Outside? What's wrong with right here on the stairs? Make a spectacle of it
21332,Rebekah," You sound like an idiot, Kol. Mother would k*ll you if you ruined her party. See you outside"
21333,Stefan," Easy, buddy. Don't want you doing anything stupid"
21334,Damon, Where's Elena?
21335,Stefan," Exactly where she belongs, talking with Esther"
21336,Damon, What did you do?
21337,Stefan," Ah, don't blame me. This was all her, right down to the broken neck. You know, maybe you should stop being such a controlling dick, Damon"
21338,Damon, Wait. Hang on. I'm the problem here?
21339,Stefan," You're a liability, brother"
21340,Damon," I'm trying to keep her alive, Stefan"
21341,Stefan," Yeah, well, your emotions are getting in the way of our plan"
21342,Damon, My emotions? How is this even happening right now?
21343,Stefan, Maybe because you care too damn much
21344,Matt, So what are we doing out here?
21345,Rebekah, Just taking a break from the polite chitchat
21346,Matt, It's freezing. Let me get my coat
21347,Rebekah, This is your car?
21348,Matt," Yep. If I could compel myself a Maserati, I would. But I can't"
21349,Rebekah," Oh, I'm a vampire. We don't... Thanks. Let's go back inside. I've got all the fresh air I need"
21350,Elijah, So how was my mother?
21351,Elena, Intense
21352,Elijah, And for what reason did she need to speak with you in private?
21353,Elijah, Elena. Should I be concerned about my mother's intentions?
21354,Elena, She just wanted to apologize for trying to have me k*ll
21355,Elijah," So it's true, then? She's forgiven Klaus?"
21356,Elena, It's true
21357,Esther," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Waiters are coming round with champagne. I invite you all to join me in raising a glass. It provides me with no greater joy than to see my family back together as one. I'd like to thank you all for being part of this spectacular evening. Cheers"
21358,Elijah, Cheers
21359,Caroline, So what did you want to show me?
21360,Klaus, One of my passions
21361,Caroline, Impressive. I take the curators at the louvre aren't on vervain
21362,Klaus," Yeah, well, that's their mistake"
21363,Caroline, What about these? Where'd you steal this from?
21364,Klaus," Well, that's a long story. But rest assured it was worn by a princess almost as beautiful as you"
21365,Caroline, Wait a second. Did... Did you do these?
21366,Klaus," Yeah. Actually one of my landscapes is hanging at the hermitage, not that anyone would notice. Have you been?"
21367,Caroline, I've never really been anywhere
21368,Klaus, I'll take you. Wherever you want. Rome. Paris. Tokyo?
21369,Caroline, Must be really nice to just snap your fingers and get whatever you want? Is that why you collect hybrids? A little servant army to take you places and bring you things?
21370,Klaus, You're making assumptions
21371,Caroline, Then why do you need Tyler? Stop controlling him. Give him his life back
21372,Klaus," You know, this has been a fun evening, but I think it's time for you to leave"
21373,Caroline," I get it. Your father didn't love you, so you assume that no one else will either. And that's why you compel people or you sire them or you try to buy them off, but that's not how it works. You don't connect with people, because you don't even try to understand them"
21374,Kol, There you are. I was waiting outside for you. Where's Matt?
21375,Rebekah," About that, I, I changed my mind. I don't want to ruin mother's night"
21376,Kol," Don't tell me you like this boy. And what did he do? He gave you 5 seconds of his attention? Don't be so predictable, Rebekah"
21377,Rebekah," You don't have to be rude about it. Just leave him be, ok?"
21378,Kol," As you wish, sister"
21379,Damon, Elena. Did you get what you want?
21380,Elena," Actually, yes"
21381,Damon, Good. Tell me on the ride home. We're leaving. Come on
21382,Elena," No, Damon. Let go of me. Look, I'm sorry that I had to, uh, cut you out of the plan"
21383,Damon, There shouldn't have been a plan. You shouldn't be here
21384,Elena," Do you think I like going behind your back? I don't. But if I hadn't asked Stefan to help, then you would have tried to be the hero, and you would have ruined everything"
21385,Damon, Sorry for trying to keep you alive. Clearly Stefan doesn't give a crap anymore
21386,Elena, Now you're mad at me for including Stefan?
21387,Damon," No, I'm mad at you because I love you!"
21388,Elena," Well, maybe that's the problem"
21389,Elena," No, that's not what I..."
21390,Damon," No, I got it, Elena. I care too much. I'm a liability. How ironic is that?"
21391,Caroline, Have you guys seen Matt?
21392,Kol, Good evening. You're Rebekah's friend. We haven't met
21393,Matt, Matt Donovan
21394,Kol, Kol Mikaelson
21395,Damon, Easy on the hand. Guy's a quarterback
21396,Stefan, Damon! Are you crazy?
21397,Damon, Maybe a little
21398,Damon, Far be it from me to cause a problem
21399,Caroline," Tyler, it's me. Look, I'm grateful for what you're doing, but... I miss you... and I really wish you were here"
21400,Caroline, Seriously. Just give up already
21401,Esther, No violence. That was all I asked. Rebekah and Kol disgraced our family tonight!
21402,Elijah," It won't happen again, mother. I'll deal with them"
21403,Esther," Thank you, Elijah. I wish the others were more like you"
21404,Finn, Are we all right to speak freely?
21405,Esther, Yes. The sage still burns
21406,Finn," You're not having second thoughts, are you?"
21407,Esther, Of course not. It's just Elijah... He's so moral
21408,Finn," You're doing the right thing, mother"
21409,Esther," You understand what this means, don't you? This spell I'm casting tonight will bind you all together as one"
21410,Finn," I understand. When it is time, I will be ready to die"
21411,Esther, Then we must complete the link
21412,Esther, The link is complete. You are one
21413,Stefan," So, uh, Esther wants to k*ll her whole family. How's that for mother of the year?"
21414,Elena, Yeah. And I got to look Elijah right in the eye and lie to him about it
21415,Stefan," Well, good. Can't say I'll be sorry to see any of 'em go"
21416,Elena," I just signed their death sentences, Stefan"
21417,Stefan," No, you signed Klaus' death sentence, Elena. Everyone else is just collateral damage"
21418,Elena, It's not that simple
21419,Stefan," The family has brought you nothing but darkness, Elena. It is that simple. So, uh... where's Damon? I would think that he'd wanna make sure you got home safely"
21420,Elena, I'll call him and let him know
21421,Stefan, What was with him going after kol?
21422,Elena, Damon being self-destructive. I said something I didn't mean
21423,Stefan," So did I. Anyway, uh... Good night"
21424,Elena, Stefan. Did you really not feel anything?
21425,Stefan, When?
21426,Elena," How do you do that? Act like you don't care, like you don't feel anything? Because I can't do that. I... I feel. I feel everything"
21427,Stefan," Elena, stop"
21428,Elena," I'm not going to stop, Stefan, because I don't believe that you feel nothing"
21429,Stefan," What? You think I want to be this person? I hurt you, Elena. I bit you. I hate myself for what I did to you"
21430,Elena, Then show it. Do something
21431,Elena," Stefan, anything is better than trying to convince me that you don't care"
21432,Stefan, I can't
21433,Elena, Stefan...
21434,Stefan," If I let myself care, all I'll feel is pain "
21435,Rebekah, Hi. What are you doing?
21436,Matt," Well, let's see. I went to a dance and got my hand crushed, found out that I don't have health insurance, so I just needed a minute to myself"
21437,Rebekah," Well, I thought maybe I'd buy you an apology drink"
21438,Matt, Maybe you could just leave me alone
21439,Rebekah," Look, I'm--I'm really sorry about Kol. He's a lunatic"
21440,Matt," Look, Rebekah, you're really fun and pretty and all... But I really need you to leave me alone"
21441,Damon, Burn. Rejected by the captain of the football team. Welcome to adolescence
21442,Rebekah," Shut up, Damon. Knew I should have k*ll him. Mother wouldn't let me"
21443,Damon, Well...
21444,Damon, Never let people tell you what to do
21445,Damon, Besides... You would have broken him in a second
21446,Rebekah, Are you suggesting I can't be gentle?
21447,Damon, No. I'm just saying you should find someone a little more durable. That's all
21448,Rebekah, And who would that be?
21449,Elena," Stefan, hey. Um... It's me. I really have to talk to you. Please call me back"
21450,Damon, What?
21451,Elena, Hey. I called you 10 times last night. We need to talk
21452,Damon, Sorry. I've been busy
21453,Elena," If you're mad at me, Damon, you need to get over it"
21454,Damon," Oh, I'm over it"
21455,Rebekah, So let's not make a big deal out of this
21456,Damon, My thoughts exactly
21457,Rebekah," Besides, I expect you'll come calling soon enough"
21458,Damon, Let's not hold our breath
21459,Elena, Did you stop taking your vervain?
21460,Damon, You think Rebekah had to compel me?
21461,Elena, What's wrong with you? She tried to k*ll me less than 48 hours ago
21462,Damon," Can't we just move past that, Elena?"
21463,Elena," So is that how it's gonna be now? I hurt your feelings, and this is how you lash out at me?"
21464,Damon," Well, maye, for once, something I did had nothing to do with you"
21465,Elena, You should know... that Esther's planning on k*ll her entire family. She's linked them all together with a spell. Whatever happens to one happens to all of them
21466,Damon, That's great. Klaus'll finally be dead. We win. Why do you look like someone just sh*t a panda bear?
21467,Elena," Because to k*ll Klaus, she has to k*ll all of them, including Elijah, and he doesn't deserve this"
21468,Damon, I'm supposed to care about Elijah?
21469,Elena, Shouldn't you at least care about Rebekah?
21470,Damon," 2 secons ago, you were pissed that she attaked you. It's a win-win"
21471,Damon," Don't do anything to screw this up, Elena"
21472,Elena, Why are you doing this?
21473,Stefan," He's right, you know. Klaus has to die they all do"
21474,Damon, See? It's democracy in action
21475,Kol," Well, well, well... there's our girl"
21476,Rebekah," Get out of my way, Kol"
21477,Kol," Out all night. What a scandal. I trust you did better than that commoner. Matt, was it?"
21478,Rebekah," If you don't shut your mouth, the next thing to come out of it will be your teeth"
21479,Rebekah," Don't start, Nik"
21480,Klaus, I didn't say anything
21481,Kol," I'm bored. Our sister is a strumpet, but at least she's having fun. I need entertainment"
21482,Klaus, What are you waiting for? Go on. Have at it
21483,Kol," It's no fun to go alone. Join me, Nik. It's the least you could do after sticking a dagger in my heart"
21484,Klaus, Ok. Why not?
21485,Klaus," I didn't have nearly enough to drink last night, what with you trying to m*rder Rebekah's date"
21486,Rebekah," Yes, please go. This house has enough men rolling around in it"
21487,Kol," Just like you, Bekah"
21488,Rebekah," Good ridance, both of you"
21489,Elijah, Rebekah
21490,Rebekah," Not you, too, Elijah"
21491,Elijah, I'm worried about mother. Have you not noticed her strange behavior?
21492,Rebekah, She's been dead for a thousand years what's strange for her?
21493,Elijah, b*rned sage. She was doing a privacy spell
21494,Rebekah, You know she fancy such things. Why don't you ask Finn? He's been doting on her
21495,Elijah, I don't trust Finn. He hates what we are. He always has
21496,Rebekah," He hates what we are. He always has. And as for mother, she returned for one reason, to make her family whole. She loves us. What trouble are you looking to find?"
21497,Elena," He was gloating, like actual gloat. Like he was proud of himself for sleeping with her. Is it working?"
21498,Caroline," It's not working. I can hear every word you're saying about Damon, the vampire gigolo"
21499,Bonnie, I don't know. It's a tricky spell
21500,Elena," When Esther did it, she kept the sage burning. There was a lot more smoke"
21501,Bonnie," All right, try it again"
21502,Bonnie," Speaking of Esther, you should know she came to see me and Abby this morning"
21503,Elena," And all this time, you let me vent about Damon?"
21504,Bonnie, I don't want you to worry
21505,Elena," Ok, well, what did she want?"
21506,Bonnie, She wanted to introduce herself. Abby and I helped bring her back. She's channeling our entire ancestral bloodline for power. I think she thought she was being polite
21507,Elena," Ok, well, is there a way to stop her from channeling you?"
21508,Bonnie," Even if there was, why would I want that?"
21509,Elena," I just keep thinking... Before the sun and the moon ritual, Elijah found a way to keep me alive. And now I'm in the exact same position, and I'm just gonna let him die? It just doesn't feel right"
21510,Caroline," Ok, first of all, this privacy spell is totally not working. Second, Elena, you are not doing this. Esther is doing this"
21511,Bonnie," There's no time to chane your mind, Elena. He'll be dead by the end of the night"
21512,Elena, What?
21513,Bonnie, It's a full moon. Esther needs to harness the energy of a celestial event. She asked me and Abby to join her
21514,Damon, Join me for a little victory drink?
21515,Stefan, We should wait until Klaus is dead
21516,Damon, Why are you so extra broody? Didn't you see the way we stood up to Elena? I like you on my team. Must have driven her nuts
21517,Stefan," You still think she' gonna screw this up, don't you?"
21518,Damon, Think somebody needs to talk to her. She's not gonna listen to anything I say
21519,Stefan, Is it because of your little sleepover?
21520,Damon, It's not my fault she decided to get jealous
21521,Stefan," Well, given who you chose to sleep with, I would say it's 100% your fault"
21522,Damon, Whatever. Did you a favor. Now you can come in and sweep her off her feet
21523,Stefan, Nah. She's better off without me. Sure as hell better off without you
21524,Damon, Fine. Neither one of us gets her. Just make sure she doesn't screw up Esther's plan
21525,Elijah, Elena
21526,Elena, Elijah
21527,Elijah, I don't mean to intrude. I was hoping you might accompany me. I want to show you something
21528,Elijah, Forgot how much I missed this land
21529,Elena, Can't even imagine what it must have been like a thousand years ago
21530,Elijah," You know, your school was built over an Indian village. Where I saw my first werewolf. The town square was where the natives would gather to worship. Matter of fact, near that was a... there was a field where wild horses used to graze"
21531,Elena, That's incredible
21532,Elijah, Come
21533,Elena," Do you know this place, too?"
21534,Elijah," I do. Below us is a cavern I used to play in as a boy, connects to a system of tunnels that stretch across the entire area. Perhaps it's nature's way of providing us with shelter against the savagery of the full moon. My mother said there must be a balance"
21535,Elena," Elijah, I should probably go home"
21536,Elijah," I admire you, Elena. You remind me of qualities I valued long before my mother turned us. It's not in your nature to be deceitful, and yet when I asked you about your meeting with my mother the other night, you lied to my face"
21537,Elena, That's not true. I told you that all your mother wanted was a new start
21538,Elijah, I can hear your b*at. It jumps when you're being dishonest with me. You lied to me at the ball and you're lying to me now. Tell me the truth
21539,Elena, I never wanted this to happen
21540,Elijah," What, Elena?"
21541,Elena," We were told, that whatever was gonna be in that coffin was gonna k*ll Klaus. When we found out that it was your mother... We didn't know what to think"
21542,Elijah," Since her return, she said she only wants this family whole again"
21543,Elena," When she asked to see me, I... I thought that maybe she could help, that she would find a way to k*ll Klaus. It's not just Klaus that she wants to k*ll"
21544,Elijah," She wants to k*ll us all, doesn't she? She wants to undo the evil she created"
21545,Elena," I'm so sorry, Elijah. I wish there was something I could do to help"
21546,Elijah," You know, one thing I've learned in my time on this earth... Be careful what you wish for"
21547,Alaric, I haven't seen Elena since this morning
21548,Damon," Well, she's not answering her phone"
21549,Alaric," Well, I'm surprised you have time to call, what with all this original sex you've been having"
21550,Damon, She told you?
21551,Alaric," Oh, she told me"
21552,Damon," Oh, really. Did she also tell you that she's having an attack of conscience about this whole original m*rder thing? "
21553,Alaric," Hey, listen, I'm not gonna judge her for having a conscience"
21554,Damon," Well, you don't have to judge her. Just tie her up. Lock her in her room till this is over"
21555,Alaric," Well, I wouldn't if I could, and I can't, because I'm busy"
21556,Damon, Busy doing what? 
21557,Alaric, Don't worry about it
21558,Damon, Are you with the sexy psycho doctor? 
21559,Alaric," Good-bye, Damon"
21560,Alaric, Sorry about that
21561,Meredith, Does he still think I'm a serial k*ll?
21562,Alaric, He's a little judgmental
21563,Meredith," Speaking of... your X-rays were inconclusive. your kn*fe wound was already semihealed. It's impossible to tell anything about whoever stabbed you. Short, tall, left-handed, right-handed... no clue"
21564,Alaric," Well, what about my head? Why can't I remember anything about the attack?"
21565,Meredith, Your CT scans were clear. Maybe you were compelled to forget
21566,Alaric, Wait. You think the k*ll's a... vampire?
21567,Meredith, There no other suspects. It's the obvious conclusion
21568,Klaus," Ah, come on now. Let's not go blaming the new family in town just 'cause you lot have got yourselves a k*ll at large. Don't mind us. My brother and I are just here to let off some steam. Right, Kol?"
21569,Kol, Right
21570,Abby," Who's the creepy, lurky guy?"
21571,Bonnie," That's Esther's son, Finn, and he's a vampire, so..."
21572,Abby, Wonder what your grams thinks about the part we're playing in all this balance of nature stuff?
21573,Bonnie," She's probably on the other side, screaming about getting involved with vampire business"
21574,Esther," Bennett witches, thank you for coming. I could think of no better allies than the woman who sent Mikael into his long sleep and the girl who fought Niklaus so bravely"
21575,Abby, Why exactly did you invite us here?
21576,Esther," You are the descendants of the witch Ayana. She was a great mentor of mine, and I think it's only fitting that I draw from her bloodline"
21577,Bonnie, So are you channeling our ancestors?
21578,Esther," I draw from the entirety of the Bennett bloodline, living and dead. The connection affords me great power, although it is somewhat difficult to maintain, which is why I require you, mother and daughter, the bloodline made manifest"
21579,Esther," Tonight, my sisters, we shall bring peace to the spirits of nature that we serve, and for that, I thank you"
21580,Rebekah, Going somewhere?
21581,Elena, What are you doing here?
21582,Rebekah," Not much, unless you try to run... in which case, I get to k*ll you"
21583,Stefan, Can't find her anywhere
21584,Elijah," Hello, Stefan"
21585,Damon, He has Elena
21586,Elijah," Actually she's with Rebekah. As you can imagine, my sister's just dying to tear her throat out. So if you want to save Elena's life, I need you to help me stop my mother"
21587,Damon," I'm a little embarrassed to admit, but when it comes to k*ll thousand-year-old resurrected witches, I'm a little rusty"
21588,Elijah," Yes, unfortunately even when k*ll, my mother doesn't seem to want to stay dead. Not with the spirits of nature at her side"
21589,Stefan, So what are we supposed to do?
21590,Elijah," The witches that released my mother, she's drawing her power from their bloodline. That line needs to be broken"
21591,Stefan, Broken?
21592,Damon," Yeah, he means..."
21593,Stefan, You want us to k*ll them?
21594,Elijah," You know I'd do it myself, but I've absolutely no idea where they are. Besides, seeing me, they'd immediately know my intent. They won't expect to be harmed by the likes of you. In any case, you have until 6 minutes after 9:00 to find them"
21595,Damon," Oh, how super-specific of you"
21596,Elijah," By 9:07, the moon'll be full. My mother will have the power she needs to k*ll me and my family. If you do not stop her before then, Rebekah will k*ll Elena. So we all have our timeline. I suggest you get started"
21597,Rebekah," All right, love. Now look into the camera"
21598,Elena, What are you doing?
21599,Rebekah, sh**ting your picture to inspire your boyfriends. Why don't you tell them how delightful it is being stuck in a hole with your biggest fan
21600,Elena," I guess you think I had this coming, after what I did to you"
21601,Rebekah," You know, I don't know what I want more... To find out we're saved, or to find out it's all right to k*ll you"
21602,Elena," This isn't my fault. I wanted to get rid of Klaus. At one point, so did you. I didn't know that your mom was planning on k*ll all of you"
21603,Rebekah," Do you think I want to spend what could be the last few hours of my life having idle chitchat with a girl who literally stabbed me in the back? Of course not. But for some reason, everybody seems to want to bend over backwards to save your life, which is incredibly annoying, but makes you the perfect hostage. So why don't you sit down and shut up before I ruin everything by ripping your head off"
21604,Damon," Clock's ticking. You gonna bring some plans, or you are too busy fixing a snack?"
21605,Stefan, We need to call Bonnie. There's gotta be a way for her to stop Esther from channeling all that power
21606,Damon," A, what if she's with Esther? B, what if she can't cut her off? C, I don't know how any of this stuff works, and, D, neither do you"
21607,Stefan, You got a better plan?
21608,Damon," Worst-case scenario, simple mechanics. Can't draw power from a dead battery."
21609,Stefan, k*ll 'em
21610,Damon, If it comes to that
21611,Stefan, There's gotta be another way
21612,Damon," Well, what if I told you I had a less diabolical plan?"
21613,Stefan, You wanna dagger Elijah
21614,Damon," Well, they're all linked. One goes down, they all go down. The witches live. Elena's safe. Problem solved"
21615,Stefan, We don't know how that'll affect Klaus
21616,Damon," Ironically, Klaus isn't our current problem"
21617,Stefan, Dagger's lethal to any vampire who uses one
21618,Damon," Well, I just so happen to know someone crazy enough to give it a sh*t"
21619,Alaric," Yeah. No, they're still here. Yeah. They've drank their way through half the Grill's liquor supply"
21620,Damon, Good. It'll be easier if they'er wasted
21621,Alaric, So what's the plan?
21622,Damon, Divide and conquer. Frst we'll need a little blonde distraction
21623,Kol, I remember her from last night. She looks like a tasty little thing
21624,Klaus," Say another word, and I'll tear out your liver. Caroline"
21625,Caroline," Oh, it's you"
21626,Klaus, Join us for a drink?
21627,Caroline," Mm, I'd rather die of thirst, but thanks"
21628,Klaus, Isn't she stunning?
21629,Kol, She certainly looks good walking away from you
21630,Klaus, I'll take that as a challenge
21631,Klaus, Caroline!
21632,Caroline, Are you serious? Take a hint
21633,Klaus," Don't be angry, love. We had a little spat. I'm over it already"
21634,Caroline," Ah, well, I'm not"
21635,Klaus," Well, how can I acquit myself?"
21636,Caroline, You and your expensive jewelry and your romantic drawings can leave me alone
21637,Klaus," Oh, come on. Take a chance, Caroline. Talk to me"
21638,Klaus, Come on. Get to know me. I dare you
21639,Caroline, Fine
21640,Caroline, So what do you want to talk about?
21641,Klaus, I want to talk about you. Your hopes. Your...your dreams. Everything you want in life
21642,Caroline," Just to be clear, I'm too smart to be seduced by you"
21643,Klaus," Well, that's why I like you"
21644,Esther, The pentagram represents our connection to magic. The salt is a symbol of the earth
21645,Bonnie, And the torches?
21646,Esther," 5 torches, one for each of my children"
21647,Bonnie, What's the spell you're doing?
21648,Esther," As the witch who cast the spell that made them vampires, I can also reverse it. When they become human again, they can be k*ll. As they are linked as one, my brave Finn will be the sacrifice. With his death will come theirs"
21649,Abby, And you're just willing to die?
21650,Finn, My mother's releasing me from an eternity of shame. It's not a sacrfice. It's a gift
21651,Kol," A woman of your caliber ought to choose more suitable company. What's your name, love?"
21652,Meredith, None of your business
21653,Kol, Let's try that again. I'll start. I'm Kol
21654,Meredith," Why don't you get lost, Kol?"
21655,Kol, And why would I do that? I like pretty little things with sharp tongues
21656,Alaric, Pretty sure she told you to get lost
21657,Kol, Pretty sure I don't care
21658,Caroline, What is it?
21659,Klaus, What did you do?
21660,Caroline, Nothing
21661,Klaus, What did you do?
21662,Caroline, I didn't do anything. Stop it
21663,Klaus, Kol
21664,Damon, Tell the sexy doctor good work
21665,Klaus, I should have k*ll you months ago
21666,Damon, Do it. That's not gonna stop Esther from k*ll you
21667,Klaus, What did you say about my mother?
21668,Damon," You didn't know I was friends with your mummy? Yeah, we have a lot in common. She hates you as much as I do"
21669,Elijah," Leave him! We still need him, Niklaus"
21670,Klaus," What did mother do? What did she do, Elijah?"
21671,Elijah, You tell me where the witches are or I'll have my sister k*ll Elena right now
21672,Damon, You told me we had until after 9:00
21673,Elijah, I'm sure Rebekah'd be more than happy to start her work early
21674,Rebekah," You can't hide, Elena! Not sure why I'm feeling under the weather. Must be your boys trying to find loophole. Won't Matter. I could chase you down on my worst day"
21675,Rebekah, You little bitch
21676,Rebekah, What is this?
21677,Elena, Sorry. No vampires allowed
21678,Meredith," No, no, no, no"
21679,Alaric," Listen, Elena's still out there. I need to go find her"
21680,Meredith, Shut up. Stay seated. You might have a concussion
21681,Alaric," So this is your place, huh?"
21682,Meredith, Kind of a slob. Housekeeping is not high on my priority list
21683,Alaric, I see that
21684,Meredith, Look at me. Pupillary response is normal. You might have a broken rib
21685,Alaric," Well, that kind of sucks, getting my ass kicked on a date"
21686,Meredith, That's what you get picking fights with guys 30 times your age
21687,Alaric, Yeah
21688,Meredith, Rest. Damon and Stefan are gonna take care of Elena. I am going to take care of you
21689,Damon, So how do we know they're gonna be at the old witch house?
21690,Stefan," We don't, but if they're not, then we have about 10 minutes till Rebekah tears Elena apart"
21691,Damon," And if we sit this out, Esther completes her spell, Klaus dies, you get your revenge. It's what you wanted the whole time. The only collateral damage is..."
21692,Stefan, Elena
21693,Damon, You know what she'd choose
21694,Stefan, She'd let herself be k*ll to save a friend
21695,Damon, Yep
21696,Stefan," If we do this, it'll wreck her"
21697,Damon," Oh, she'll hate us. Thing is she only needs to hate one of us. Only one of us has to do the actual deed "
21698,Stefan," So who's it gonna be, brother?"
21699,Damon," Heads, I do it. Tails, you do it"
21700,Stefan, Awful lot of effort for someone who pretends not to care about her anymore
21701,Damon," Pot, kettle, brother"
21702,Rebekah, Elena
21703,Rebekah, Let's pick it up where we left off
21704,Elena, What are you doing?
21705,Rebekah, Thought I'd shake things up a bit
21706,Elena, Are you insane?
21707,Rebekah, I prefer spontaneous. That's probably why Damon likes me so much. Here's what's gonna happen
21708,Rebekah," You're gonna come outside... or you're gonna stay in there and burn. The next match is landing on you. So, Elena, how does it feel to know that these may be your last moments?"
21709,Elena, I don't know. You tell me. You're the one whose mother is trying to k*ll you
21710,Rebekah, You should be very careful what you say to me
21711,Elena, You're still wearing her necklace
21712,Rebekah, Do you want it? Is that your last request? Here. It's all yours
21713,Elena," She's not doing this because she hates you, Rebekah. She told me that she... she just doesn't have another choice"
21714,Rebekah," Spare me your pity, Elena. We're not girlfriends. You want me to prove it? Say the word"
21715,Elena, You're not gonna do it
21716,Rebekah, And why is that?
21717,Elena," Because there's still a chance that you might be alive tomorrow, and if that's the case, and you k*ll me now, you'll have used up all of your revenge. Wasted it. And isn't that what you want, revenge. Because I... I pretended to like you and then I stuck a dagger in your back? I mean, that's why you slept with Damon, isn't it? That's why you're tormenting me, because I hurt your feelings"
21718,Rebekah, The tough act doesn't suit you
21719,Elena, I never said I was tough. We both know that I'm right
21720,Finn," They're coming, mother"
21721,Esther, No. It's too soon. The moon is not high enough. Go quickly
21722,Esther," My sons, come forward"
21723,Finn, Stay beside me
21724,Esther, It's ok. They can't enter
21725,Kol," That's lovely. We are stuck out here while the favorite son plays sacrificial lamb. How pathetic you are, Finn"
21726,Esther," Be quiet, Kol. Your brother knows virtue you cannot even imagine"
21727,Elijah," Whatever you think of us, k*ll your own children would be an atrocity"
21728,Esther, My only regret is that I did no let you die a thousand years ago
21729,Klaus," Enough. All this talk is boring me. End this now, mother, or I'll send you back to hell"
21730,Esther," For a thousand years, I've been forced to watch you, felt the pain of every v*ctim, suffered while you shed bl*od. Even you, Elijah, with your claim to nobility you're no better. All of you... you're a curse on this earth stretched out over generations. If you've come to plead for your life... I'm sorry. You've wasted your time"
21731,Abby, This place has some serious vibe in it
21732,Bonnie," The witch spirits will protect us from the originals, but we should get into the basement"
21733,Bonnie, Abby!
21734,Bonnie," Stefan, what's going on?"
21735,Stefan, They took Elena. They're gonna k*ll her unless we stop Esther
21736,Bonnie," God, Stefan, I... I can't stop her. She's channeling us"
21737,Stefan," Bonnie, if you can't stop her... I have to find another way"
21738,Bonnie," Stefan, no. What are you gonna do? Even if you k*ll us, Esther's channeling every witch in our ancestry, living and dead"
21739,Stefan," Esther's drawing from the witches, and the only way to cut her off is if one of you is no longer a witch"
21740,Damon, This'll only hurt a second
21741,Esther," No. Sisters, do not abandon me!"
21742,Rebekah, You can come out now. Seems your boys took care of the problem
21743,Elena, How did they do that?
21744,Rebekah, Damon turned your witch friend's mother into a vampire
21745,Elena, What?
21746,Rebekah," Quite clever, actually. They needed to sever the witch line, and, well, you can't be a witch and a vampire. In any case, you're free to go. Oh, and, uh, by the way, you were right. I do prefer taking my time watching you suffer. Much more satisfying"
21747,Caroline, She doesn't want to see you
21748,Elena, Please just let me talk to her
21749,Caroline," Abby's in transition. It's gonna be really hard over the next few days, and if Bonnie needs some time to deal, then I think you should give it to her"
21750,Elena," She's always been there for me, Caroline. Please let me just be there for her, too"
21751,Caroline," I'm sorry, Elena. I know that you want to help, but put yourself in her shoes. Everything that happened tonight was to save you. And that's ok, because she loves you so much. But somehow she's always the one who gets hurt"
21752,Elena," Yeah. You're right. I just... Just tell her that I love her, ok?"
21753,Caroline, Of course I will
21754,Damon, Is she safe?
21755,Stefan, Elijah ket his word. Rebekah let her go
21756,Damon, Good. All's right in the world again
21757,Stefan," I lost that coin toss, Damon. Should have been me who turned Abby. Why did you do it?"
21758,Damon," Cause I'm not blind. I see what's been going on around here. Hanging by threats, Stefan, barely over your last ripper binge, and all you want is to be the old Stefan again"
21759,Stefan, That part of me is gone for good
21760,Damon," Oh, yeah? How long has it been since you had a drop of human bl*od?"
21761,Stefan, How'd you know?
21762,Damon," Spend 146 years with someone, you kind of start to pick up on their tells. Into the question. How long has it been since your last drink?"
21763,Stefan, Since the night I threatened to drive Elena off the wickery bridge
21764,Damon," See? You have enough to feel guilty about. Why add to the list? By the way, you're welcome"
21765,Stefan," You know, you're not fooling anyone either. You still love her, Damon"
21766,Damon, I do. I thought I could win her from you fair and square. She didn't want me. It's for the best. I'm better at being the bad guy anyway
21767,Elijah," Elena, today I did things I abhor to protect the one thing I value most, my family. If anyone can understand it, it's you. Your compassion is a gift, Elena. Carry it with you, as I will carry my regret. Always and forever, Elijah"
21768,Rebekah, Where the bloody hell is everyone?
21769,Elijah," It's over, Rebekah"
21770,Rebekah, Where's mother?
21771,Elijah," We have no mother, Only Esther, and Esther was right"
21772,Rebekah, What'd you mean?
21773,Elijah," Although I talk of virtue, when it suits my needs, I k*ll, maim, and torment. Even today, I terrorized an innocent"
21774,Rebekah, Elena is hardly innocent
21775,Elijah, And I used your hatred of her to get what I wanted... wielded you like I would a sword... my sister
21776,Rebekah," You did it to protect us, Elijah, and rightly so. We deserve to live. We are better than they are"
21777,Elijah, Are we? Mother made us vampires. She didn't make us monsters. We did that to ourselves
21778,Klaus," I thought you'd have gone by now. Elijah's leaving. Kol's fled. Esther and Finn are gone, too"
21779,Rebekah," I hated you when I learned you k*ll our mother... But I realize now that after a thousand years together as a family, you're the only one who never left me"
21780,Klaus," Well, aren't we a pair?"
21781,Rebekah, There's something I think you need to see
21782,Klaus, Come to brag about your k*ll as a torturer?
21783,Rebekah, Look at the images on the wall behind Elena. The natives told the story of our family history. Look at the images on the far wall
21784,Klaus, What is it?
21785,Rebekah, A native worshiping at the white oak tree
21786,Klaus, We burnt that tree to the ground
21787,Rebekah, Look at the markings that precede it. That's the native calendar
21788,Klaus, This can't be right
21789,Rebekah," A white oak tree 300 years after we fled back to the old world. There must have been a sapling, a new tree to replace the old. That tree could k*ll us. It's not over, Nik"
21790,Meredith, You weren't supposed to see that
21791,Sheriff Forbes," Will you get home all right, Mr.Salvatore? I could send for one of the police vehicles"
21792,Mr Salvatore," A little winter chill never hurt anyone, sheriff Forbes"
21793,Sheriff Forbes," I'm less concerned about the cold front, more for your safety"
21794,Mr Salvatore," One councilman's m*rder doesn't make an epidemic, Gerald. Good Night"
21795,Sheriff Forbes, Good Night
21796,Liz," The mystery's not gonna get solved any faster with you yelling at me, Carol"
21797,Carol," We have 2 council m*rder and an attempted m*rder on our hands. If you have a suspect, it is your duty to keep me in the loop"
21798,Liz," No, it's my duty to make sure I don't accuse an innocent person of being a serial k*ll"
21799,Carol," Just tell me who it is, Liz"
21800,Alaric, I didn't do it
21801,Damon, You're arresting him? For what this nutjob Dr. Fell says?
21802,Liz," No, I'm detaining him. The cell is for his own good. You were sh*t. Dr. Fell used vampire bl*od to heal you"
21803,Alaric, Dr. Fell is the one who sh*t me
21804,Liz, Because you came at her with a kn*fe
21805,Alaric," Yeah, with a kn*fe I had found hidden in her things"
21806,Damon," Are we gonna ignore the part where he's one of the k*ll's v*ctim? I mean, the guy was practically stabbed to death"
21807,Liz," Well, Dr. Fell suggested his wounds could have been self-inflicted"
21808,Alaric," My God, you think I stabbed myself?"
21809,Liz," Look, I think I don't know what to think. I've got nothing except m*rder w*apon from your stash and a respected member of a founding family pointing a very long finger"
21810,Alaric, She is setting me up. I'm being framed here
21811,Liz," Well, that may be so, but I don't have any proof of that"
21812,Damon," Well, then we'll find some"
21813,Liz," No, just stay out of this, Damon. You getting involved is only gonna make matters worse"
21814,Damon," Listen, Liz..."
21815,Liz, Don't make me put you in that cell with him
21816,Matt," What are we running, a marathon?"
21817,Elena, If you can't keep up...
21818,Matt," Elena, you can't outrun your problems"
21819,Matt, Although it looks like you're gonna try. I talked to Bonnie!
21820,Elena, What did she say?
21821,Matt, They're at her mom's house. Abby's gonna complete the transition
21822,Elena, She decided to become a vampire?
21823,Matt," Yeah. Caroline's gonna help her through it, teach her control and stuff"
21824,Elena, Did Bonnie say... Is there anything I can do?
21825,Matt," She knows it's not your fault, Elena. She's just... Upset"
21826,Elena, Damon turned her mom into a vampire to save my life. It's absolutely my fault
21827,Matt," You're gonna make me run more, aren't you?"
21828,Matt, Who is it?
21829,Elena, Sheriff Forbes. Everything ok? He what?
21830,Elena, Were you just with...
21831,Damon, Ric's fine. Sheriff wants me to stay out of it
21832,Elena," But you're not going to, are you?"
21833,Damon, Seems just as good a plan as any
21834,Elena, Your friend's in jail for m*rder. You have to do something
21835,Damon," Well, I guess I could rip out Dr. False Accusation's throat or maybe her tongue. You know, I could chew it up in little, tiny pieces and feed it to the squirrels"
21836,Elena, Stop it Damon
21837,Damon," Guess me staying out of it suddenly sounds like a good idea, doesn't it? I saved your life last night. You're welcome"
21838,Elena," You know, you could show a little compassion about Bonnie"
21839,Damon, I know. You're right. Her and her mom must be really hurting right now. Should I send lasagna?
21840,Elena," Ok, now you're just being mean"
21841,Damon, I'm mean. You hate me. The earth is back on its axis
21842,Elena," You know what? If you keep pushing people away, you're gonna end up alone"
21843,Damon," ""Dear diary, the chipmunk asked me my name today. I told him it was Joe. That lie"
21844,Stefan, What do you want?
21845,Damon," I was hoping we could hang. You know, little brother bonding. I mean, I know"
21846,Stefan, What are you doing?
21847,Damon," Digging up clues. Most of the originals are gone, but we have a whodunit going on. Hey, do you remember when we came back for Zachariah's funeral?"
21848,Stefan, Vaguely. Why?
21849,Damon," 'Cause if memory serves, he wasn't the first founders council member k*ll that year or even that month"
21850,Stefan, Your point being?
21851,Damon, I'm trying to remember what year it was
21852,Stefan, 1912
21853,Damon," So much for vaguely. 1912. Or as I like to call it, last time Mystic Falls had a serial k*ll on its hands"
21854,Stefan," It feels so strange to be home again after so long away. I thought I would never return, certainly not for a funeral "
21855,Mariana Lockwood ," I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Salvatore. I'm told you're a distant cousin of Zachariah"
21856,Stefan," His nephew, actually. Miss..."
21857,Mariana Lockwood, Lockwood. Mariana Lockwood. And this is my friend Samantha Gilbert
21858,Stefan, As in Jonathan Gilbert
21859,Samantha Gilbert, My late grandfather. Did you know him?
21860,Stefan, Crossed paths. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be... Inappropriate. But no one seems to be willing to discuss the details of Zachariah's death
21861,Samantha Gilbert," He was m*rder, and he wasn't the first"
21862,Mariana Lockwood," Samantha, don't be a gossip"
21863,Samantha Gilbert," Why not? He should know. He's a founding family like us. Be careful, Mr. Salvatore. It's not a good time to be a founder in this town"
21864,Damon, Have you been eating the relatives again?
21865,Stefan, Damon
21866,Damon," It's been a long time, brother"
21867,Stefan, It's been almost 50 years. Surprised you came
21868,Damon, And miss the funeral of... What do you call him? Uncle Zachariah?
21869,Stefan, I see you're still mad at me
21870,Damon," Why would I be mad at you, Stefan? You made me become a vampire, and now I walk the world alone drinking other people's bl*od"
21871,Stefan, Any chance you took it all out on our nephew Zachariah?
21872,Damon," If I'm not mistaken, you were the one who k*ll our family members. May our father rest in peace"
21873,Stefan," I'm not like that anymore, Damon"
21874,Damon," Well, congratulations, Stefan. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to live out my eternal existence as far away from you as possible"
21875,Stefan," Damon, wait. Let's grab a drink, catch up. I've missed you, brother"
21876,Damon, Sure. Why not?
21877,Stefan," Ah. I get it. I get it. You're bored. Your best friend's in jail, and you don't have anything better to do with yourself"
21878,Damon," Well, there's that. And... I was hoping you could help me solve a m*rder"
21879,Rebekah," Thank you for meeting with me, mayor. I figured as head of the preservation society, you'd be a good person to ask about the oldest trees in this community"
21880,Carol, A long line of Lockwood women used to keep those records back before any of them had actual jobs
21881,Rebekah," I've been to the founders archive, but I can't seem to find any record of the tree I'm looking for"
21882,Carol, It probably got cut down. Big old trees built half this town in the 1900s
21883,Damon," Ho. She-devil, 9 o'clock"
21884,Rebekah, Do you happen to know who kept the milling ledgers during that period?
21885,Carol," Back then, all the logging mills were owned by the Salvatores"
21886,Damon," So what does the Cal examiner, bill Forbes, and Alaric Saltzman have in common?"
21887,Damon, Come on. Knock it off
21888,Damon," You know, quitting bl*od cold Turkey after a ripper binge, probably not the best approach. Every time you play that all-or-nothing game, you eventually leave a trail of bodies, so I'm thinking now's a good time to pay our old friend moderation a visit"
21889,Stefan," They were all on the founders council, Damon. That's what they have in common"
21890,Damon," But why them, huh? Brian Walters and Alaric weren't from founding families. I mean, hey, if you gotta slaughter council members, go a-list. At least in 1912, they k*ll a Salvatore"
21891,Rebekah, Which Salvatore would that be?
21892,Alaric," You'll have to agree, sheriff, there's no motive here"
21893,Liz," Look, both the medical examiner and my ex-husband got into altercations with Meredith Fell before their deaths. Now, she said you were a witness to her fight with Brian Walters"
21894,Alaric," So what are you saying, that I was defending her honor? I barely knew her then"
21895,Liz, She said she also told you Bill threatened to report her to the medical board for giving him vampire bl*od
21896,Alaric," No, she didn't"
21897,Liz, A 2 a.M. Call on the night he was k*ll? I pulled your records. You spoke with her for over an hour
21898,Alaric," Ok. I, uh... Yes, I... I remember calling her, but I... I was drinking, and I... I don't remember the conversation"
21899,Liz," Well, do you have an alibi for the night Brian Walters was k*ll?"
21900,Alaric," I was there the night of the bridge fundraiser, ok, until midnight. You saw me there"
21901,Liz, Time of death was between 1:00 and 3 a.M
21902,Alaric," Well, then, I... I must have been home sleeping, I'm sure. I'm sure of it"
21903,Rebekah, So Zachariah Salvatore was your nephew?
21904,Damon," Well, our father knocked up one of the maids during the civil w*r. She had a son. But as far"
21905,Rebekah," And, uh, your family owned the logging mills back then"
21906,Damon, You're full of a lot of questions
21907,Rebekah," I'm just researching the town history. I grew up here, after all"
21908,Damon," You know, you don't have to disguise your true motives. Blondie bex. If you want more sex, just ask for it"
21909,Rebekah, Not enough liquor in the world
21910,Damon," Oh, come on. It was too good for you to be this hostile"
21911,Damon, You'll have to excuse my little brother. He's jonesing for some o-positive
21912,Stefan, I'm not jonesing
21913,Rebekah, So they never catch the k*ll?
21914,Damon, Nope. Wrote it all off on vampires
21915,Rebekah, Maybe it was a vampire
21916,Stefan," Yeah. Yeah, maybe it was a vampire, Damon"
21917,Damon," Don't think for a second you didn't cross my mind, too, brother. But these m*rder weren't your style, were they? Plus there were no other vampires circulating then"
21918,Stefan," Well, there was one other vampire. Remember Sage?"
21919,Damon," Oh, right. Sage. Speaking of great sex"
21920,Stefan, Maybe you've had enough
21921,Damon, Hit a man when he's down
21922,Sage, Who's next? $100 to any man who can b*at me
21923,Stefan," I can teach you how to survive without human bl*od, you know"
21924,Damon," You do not get to lecture me on how to live my life, not anymore"
21925,Sage, What's your name?
21926,Damon, Not interested
21927,Sage," Well, Mr. not interested, you seem to me like a gambling man"
21928,Damon, I'm afraid you have me all wrong
21929,Sage," Well, that's too bad"
21930,Rebekah, I knew Sage once. Trashy little thing
21931,Damon, You really think it was Sage who was k*ll all those founders back then?
21932,Stefan, Town questioned every grown man in Mystic Falls. Probably never occurred to them that a woman could have done it
21933,Meredith," I'm due in surgery. Whatever case you're gonna make against Alaric, make it quick"
21934,Elena, I don't have to make a case. He didn't do anything
21935,Meredith," How do you know? Sure you live with him, he takes care of you, but do you really know anything about him?"
21936,Elena, I know enough
21937,Meredith," Let me tell you what I know. He was arrested for fighting 4 times before the age of 21. When he was at Duke, his future wife Isobel filed a restraining order against him twice. Although then she married him, so I guess that says more about her"
21938,Elena," Ok, you're making all of this up"
21939,Meredith," Am I? How would you know? You took pity on a borderline alcoholic vampire hunter, and you never even thought to look any deeper"
21940,Elena," How could you do this to him? He didn't k*ll anyone, and you know it"
21941,Meredith," You date vampires, Elena. It shouldn't come as a shock to learn that your guardian is a m*rder"
21942,Rebekah," So, uh, tell me more about your old relatives. I heard they tore down half the woods to make this town"
21943,Damon," Easy there, lushy pants. It's been a hoot and a half, but it's boys night, and you weren't invited"
21944,Elena, Wow. Nice job
21945,Matt, I'll add breaking and entering to the list of life favors you owe me
21946,Elena," Ok, look, I don't know how much longer she's gonna be in surgery, so let's see what we can find"
21947,Matt, Don't you think the police already combed through this place? She handed over everything she had
21948,Elena," Yeah, I'm looking for the evidence that she didn't hand over"
21949,Matt, And you're sure it's her we should be investigating?
21950,Elena," I know him, Matt. He's innocent. And I know that Meredith's a Fell, founding family, which means..."
21951,Elena, Skeleton in the closet... Just like a true founder
21952,Elena," Brian Walters, Bill Forbes"
21953,Matt, Alaric Saltzman
21954,Damon," So... Let's just say sage was k*ll everyone in 1912. Who the hell is doing it now? It's not that psycho, Dr. Fell. She's a woman. There's no way she could stab 3 grown men"
21955,Rebekah, That's a bit sexist. A woman could easily k*ll a man with the right motivation
21956,Stefan," You just, uh, don't give up, do you?"
21957,Rebekah, Why are you so grumpy?
21958,Damon," He's on a master cleanse, trying to be a better man and all"
21959,Rebekah," Yeah, you were a lot more fun in the twenties"
21960,Damon, You'll rile him up. He's testy when he's being self-righteous
21961,Stefan," I'm not being self-righteous, Damon. I'm just not interested in slaughtering innocent human beings anymore"
21962,Damon," Oh, ok. Fair enough. My mistake. You used to be self-righteous"
21963,Damon," ""Dear diary, Damon has lost his way. Though I have pulled my own life together, he continues to waste his."""
21964,Rebekah, Ouch
21965,Rebekah," ""His bitterness consumes him. He is nothing but blackness and bile."" Oof. Judgey"
21966,Rebekah," You know, if I'm being honest. You didn't seem like much fun either, Damon"
21967,Damon, I wasn't. Woman I was in love with was stuck in a tomb. She wasn't getting out for 100 years. I wasn't having any fun at all
21968,Sage, You're doing it all wrong. Bad vampire
21969,Damon, I was hungry. Now I'm not hungry. My quality of form is... Purely subjective
21970,Sage, A woman isn't just for food. She's for pleasure
21971,Damon, I do not need a woman for pleasure. I am spoken for
21972,Sage, We are all spoken for in some way. But what is being a vampire if not relishing in the pleasure of it? Come along. Let me show you
21973,Sage," Look at the women. They're beautiful, aren't they?"
21974,Sage," Not them. They're too hungry for attention. You want the ones who button themselves up. Watch them. They can't tear their eyes away. Those are the women who secretly crave seduction. They'll put up a good fight, but the game is in winning them over, making them beg for it"
21975,Damon, What if they don't?
21976,Sage, You're a vampire. You take it
21977,Sage, Her
21978,Rebekah," That sounded like sage, all right"
21979,Damon, How did you know her?
21980,Rebekah, She was obsessed with my brother Finn over 900 years ago
21981,Damon," What? Creepy, suicidal guy?"
21982,Damon, You're doing it again
21983,Stefan," I need to, uh... I got to get out of here"
21984,Damon, Sure. First admit you're jonesing
21985,Stefan," Damon, I'm not gonna..."
21986,Damon, Admit it
21987,Stefan," Ok, fine. I'm freaking out. I'm ready to eat the entire wait staff. Why do you need to hear me say it?"
21988,Damon," Because I'm feeling a little self-righteous, too"
21989,Elena," She's got everything on him... Medical records, old court documents"
21990,Matt, What's this?
21991,Elena, It's an old Gilbert journal
21992,Matt, Why is one of your old family journals in her closet?
21993,Matt, Didn't you say the medical examiner's time of death was between 1:00 and 3 a.M.?
21994,Elena, Yeah. Why?
21995,Matt, Because the county coroner's office says that's wrong
21996,Matt, Oh my god
21997,Liz, What were you thinking?
21998,Elena, I know that we had no right
21999,Liz, No right? You broke the law
22000,Elena, But we found something that clears Alaric. It gives him an alibi in the Brian Walters m*rder
22001,Liz, you mean this?
22002,Elena, What is that?
22003,Liz," A letter from the county coroner's office correcting the error in the time of death of Brian Walters. Meredith Fell received it today. She brought it to me several hours ago, full of apologies for accusing an innocent man"
22004,Matt, Why would she have a copy hidden in her closet?
22005,Liz," I can't ask those questions, Matt, because of the very fact that you broke into her home to find it. Do you know how much I'm already protecting both of you?"
22006,Elena, I'm sorry
22007,Liz," Just get out of my office and go home, please. Alaric'll be released as soon as the letter is authenticated. Go"
22008,Rebekah, So he doesn't want to drink human bl*od?
22009,Damon," Ah, he has an eternally guilty conscience"
22010,Rebekah," Funny. When I knew him in the twenties, he didn't have any conscience at all. It's one of the things I liked most about him. He can't possibly think he can survive without feeding"
22011,Damon," Oh, on the contrary. He's determined to live his life pursuing one extreme or the other. He's a stubborn one, my brother. Think I'm gonna need some help with this one"
22012,Rebekah, What can I do?
22013,Damon, Hello
22014,Woman, Hi
22015,Damon," This may seem very forward, but you're just so pretty"
22016,Woman, Thank you
22017,Damon," And please don't scream. You're about to have a very, very bad night"
22018,Damon," Sorry, brother. It's dinnertime. Have a bite"
22019,Stefan, What are you doing?
22020,Damon," Tough love, Stefan. You're not gonna survive this cold-Turkey thing. You never do. It's time to get that monkey off your back"
22021,Stefan, No
22022,Damon, Feed... Or I'll let rebekah have her way with her. You know she'll k*ll her
22023,Rebekah," Oh, I will"
22024,Damon," Then her bl*od'll be on your hands. Or you can just have a little drink, save her life. Come on, Stefan. You were the one that said you didn't want any more innocent life slaughtered. Save her. Go on. Have a bite. I snatched. You eat. I erase. Hell, I'll even heal her for you when it's over"
22025,Stefan, Why are you doing this? You know what bl*od does to me
22026,Damon, 'Cause you let it control you. You always have. I'm just here to help you learn how to fight it
22027,Rebekah, This is rubbish
22028,Damon, I got it from here. Go ahead
22029,Rebekah, Night's just getting started
22030,Damon, Scram. No one likes a lurker
22031,Rebekah," You're a real ass, you know"
22032,Damon, So I'm told
22033,Damon," All right, that's enough"
22034,Damon, Come on. You're gonna bleed her dry. You're gonna drain her. Come on. I said that's enough
22035,Damon," Hey, you wanna fight hunger, or you wanna fight me?"
22036,Damon, I got you. That's a good girl
22037,Elena, What are you doing?
22038,Elena, Stefan
22039,Stefan, Elena
22040,Elena, What are you two doing?
22041,Damon," Relax, Elena. Just a little experiment. There's no need to make this more dramatic than it needs to be"
22042,Matt," Elena, let's just go. Elena!"
22043,Damon, So... That's gonna take a little time
22044,Damon," Stefan. Wait. Hey. Stefan, wait"
22045,Elena, Just say it
22046,Matt," I just don't get it, your thing with them"
22047,Elena," I know it doesn't make sense. But at the beginning, after my parents died, there was something about being with Stefan that just... Felt safe"
22048,Matt," Safe? Elena, he's a vampire"
22049,Elena," I know, believe me. Just saying it out loud sounds crazy, but... It's like I knew that he would never stop loving me, like he would never..."
22050,Matt, What?
22051,Elena, Die. Like he would never die
22052,Matt, Like your parents did. And Damon?
22053,Elena," Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin, and no matter what I do, I just... I can't shake him"
22054,Matt," Once you fall in love with someone, I don't know if... I don't know if you can ever shake 'em"
22055,Elena, I'm sorry. Is... is this weird? Talking about them with you?
22056,Matt, No. Not really. I got you something
22057,Elena, The journal?
22058,Matt, It's your family's. You should have it. Meredith and that idiot deputy were too busy questioning you to give a damn about me. Sometimes it pays to be the only normal one in a town of vampires. Practically invisible
22059,Elena, Are you ok?
22060,Alaric, Yeah. Yeah. I'm all right
22061,Damon," They let Ric go. Sheriff Forbes said she's out of suspects again, but Ric is in the clear. I know it may not seem like it, but... You did really well tonight. I mean, before you know it, you're gonna be the king of moderation. Elena will understand"
22062,Stefan, Doesn't really matter what Elena thinks
22063,Damon," Uh-uh. None of that. No more no humanity Stefan. There's a road called recovery, and we are on it"
22064,Stefan," Why do you even care, huh? The whole brother-bonding thing, getting Elena to hate you. Why, you feel guilty because you kissed her? Is that it, Damon? Because you can stop. Go back to hating me. It was a lot easier"
22065,Damon, Can you for one minute actually believe that I'm trying to help you?
22066,Stefan, I don't need your help
22067,Damon, Don't need my... Are you kidding me? Do you remember what happened last time you said that?
22068,Stefan, What are you talking about?
22069,Damon," 1912, Stefan, the last time I convinced you to drink human bl*od"
22070,Damon," Go ahead, Stefan. Pick one"
22071,Stefan," They're people, Damon"
22072,Damon," Yes, they are people, Stefan, people with bl*od pumping through their veins, waiting to be opened up and sucked dry. You've just forgotten how good it feels. So had I, but Sage, she reminded me... It's worth it. It's all worth it"
22073,Damon," Not him, Stefan. Not him... Her"
22074,Damon, Her. She's the one
22075,Stefan, I don't do that anymore
22076,Damon," But you can, Stefan. We can. Let the past be the past. Have a drink with me, brother"
22077,Damon, I knew you still had it in you. Don't be greedy
22078,Damon, Stefan. Stefan
22079,Stefan," Oh, my God. Oh, my God"
22080,Stefan, I'm sorry
22081,Damon," Stefan, stop"
22082,Stefan, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
22083,Damon," Stefan, stop"
22084,Stefan, What did you do to me?!
22085,Damon, You just need to learn when to stop. I can help you
22086,Stefan, I don't need your help
22087,Damon," The founders council k*ll had nothing on you. By decade's end, they were calling you the ripper of monterey. I let you walk away. I watched you go over the edge, and I didn't do anything to stop you"
22088,Stefan, You couldn't have
22089,Damon," Sure, I could have. But I just didn't want to. But I want to now. Whenever you go too far, I will be there to pull you back, every second, every day till you don't need m"
22090,Stefan, Why?
22091,Damon, 'Cause right now... You're all I got
22092,Alaric," Hey, I was gonna make some coffee"
22093,Elena, I'm good. Gonna head to bed in a few
22094,Alaric," Hey, listen, Elena. The, uh... The sheriff told me about everything you did today, and... While I appreciate it, I don't want you getting in trouble because of me, ok?"
22095,Elena," If not for you, for who?"
22096,Alaric," Well, still, I... I'm the one who's supposed to look after you, even if I suck at it"
22097,Elena," Ok, well, how 'bout we just agree to take care of each other, then?"
22098,Alaric, Heh. Deal. What are you reading there? 
22099,Elena, Old family journal
22100,Alaric, Any juicy family secrets?
22101,Elena," It's hard to tell. I mean, at first, I thought it was Jonathan Gilbert's journal, but it ended up being his granddaughter's, who apparently went just as crazy as he did, so great genes, huh?"
22102,Alaric," Well, at least you have something to look forward to"
22103,Elena," Good night, Ric"
22104,Alaric, Good Night
22105,Stefan," So I, uh... I dug into the old family archives from the early 1900s"
22106,Damon, So now you want to be helpful
22107,Stefan, Want me to go back to being mad at you?
22108,Damon, What'd you find?
22109,Stefan," Well, nothing from 1912. They never did arrest anyone for the founders' m*rder, but they did get a confession 10 years later"
22110,Damon, They did? Who?
22111,Stefan," Jonathan Gilbert's granddaughter Samantha. They assumed she was crazy, locked her up in an insane asylum"
22112,Damon, Then what?
22113,Stefan," Trail ends there. I mean, she was a founder. You know they like to look out for their own"
22114,Damon, Samantha Gilbert. That is very weird
22115,Stefan, Why?
22116,Damon, Because I'm pretty sure I had already k*ll her
22117,Meredith, I know what this looks like
22118,Alaric," Yeah? Well, I sure as hell don't. You sh**t me, you have me thrown in jail, and then you have me freed"
22119,Meredith," I did it for you, Ric. I forged the coroner's note to clear your name"
22120,Alaric, Oh. You know what? People are right. You are psycho
22121,Meredith," Yeah... Now that you've been cleared, they'll look somewhere else. They won't look your way again. Please, you have no reason, but I need you to trust me anyway. If you let me in, I can explain"
22122,Samantha Gilbert, I don't feel like myself. I am losing time... As though I am going mad
22123,Stefan," So you think Samantha Gilbert's still alive, running around Mystic Falls, k*ll founders?"
22124,Damon," It's not possible. If she became a vampire, we'd know about it, right?"
22125,Stefan," Well, then she must have had a ring that brought her back to life. I mean, she was a... a Gilbert, right? Those rings are passed on through generations"
22126,Damon," Yeah, but even if she had a ring, she wouldn't be alive today. Doesn't protect her from old age"
22127,Stefan," Jonathan Gilbert only made two of those rings. Jeremy has one of 'em, and the other is..."
22128,Damon, Alaric's
22129,Meredith," Like the sheriff said, the v*ctim were k*ll with your w*apon"
22130,Alaric," Yeah, but I was attacked"
22131,Meredith," With your own kn*fe, a wound that could have been self-inflicted"
22132,Alaric, It's impossible. I would know if I were k*ll people
22133,Meredith," Would you? Have you had any blackouts, instances of lost time?"
22134,Alaric, Y-you're insane
22135,Meredith," No, but I think you might be. You wear a ring that lets you cheat death, Ric. How many times can you die before it changes you? I think you're sick, and I want to help you. This has happened before almost 100 years ago"
22136,Alaric, Elena
22137,Elena," Ric, I think she's right"
22138,Elena, What are you looking for?
22139,Meredith," I don't know. A tumor, vascular anomalies. Anything physical that might explain his behavior. If it's medical, I can treat it"
22140,Elena, And if it's not?
22141,Meredith," Well... Then we'll deal with that, too"
22142,Elena, When did you suspect him? That it was Alaric who was k*ll all of those people?
22143,Meredith," It was after he told me about his ring. I remembered a story my grandmother had told me about Samantha Gilbert and her secret journal. I don't know if you know this, but we Fells are notorious busybodies"
22144,Elena, Then why did you protect him?
22145,Meredith," Because I'm a doctor. I don't like to see someone hurt by something they have no control over. And, because when he and I first met, I felt like, I don't know, I... I just kind of want to help him"
22146,Alaric, No! Meredith! Meredith...
22147,Meredith, Everything all right in there?
22148,Alaric," Yeah. Yeah, everything's OK"
22149,Elena," Well, everything is normal"
22150,Alaric," Because there is nothing wrong with me. I didn't k*ll Brian Walters, I didn't k*ll bill Forbes, and I sure as hell didn't shove a hunting kn*fe into my stomach. Or I did, and I've gone insane, just like your ancestor, who... Wore that ring"
22151,Elena," Look, I'm going to call Bonnie. The rings were made by a Bennett witch. Maybe a witch can reverse the damage"
22152,Alaric, Take it. I don't want it anymore
22153,Damon, Ready to ditch this house of horrors? Oof. You look terrible
22154,Alaric, Yeah. Let me... let me check out of here
22155,Damon," Don't worry about him. We'll take him out for chicken soup, we'll get him a Martini, make sure he doesn't k*ll anybody"
22156,Elena, What is wrong with you? How could you just go out feeding with Stefan like some vampire pub crawl?
22157,Damon," Oh, right. I thought we were talking about Alaric, but of course we're talking about Stefan"
22158,Elena, You stood there and let him feed on an innocent girl!
22159,Damon," I didn't let him do anything. If you want to get nit-picky about it, I made him"
22160,Elena, Why would you do that?
22161,Damon," Because we're vampires, Elena. We need human bl*od to survive. We're predators, not puppies"
22162,Elena," Well, Stefan found a way around it before"
22163,Damon, Stefan has built himself a delusional wagon which he has repeatedly fallen off of. What he needs to learn is control
22164,Elena, He was able to manage it when he was drinking my bl*od. Small amounts every single day
22165,Damon," Ah, yes. Back when you two were in love and it was all rainbows and unicorns"
22166,Elena, I'm just saying. Maybe you're not the right person to be teaching Stefan about self control
22167,Caroline, Hey!
22168,Bonnie, Hey
22169,Caroline," I totally lucked out. The hospital just had a bl*od drive, so, I got some... O negatives, some a's, and, my personal favorite, b positive"
22170,Bonnie, Yeah. I made her a daylight ring. She's just been standing out there all morning. I don't think she's taking this very well
22171,Caroline," Well, it's only been a few days since she turned. Your mom's still adjusting"
22172,Caroline," Miss Wilson? Why don't you come inside? You know, have something to drink"
22173,Abby, I can't feel it anymore. My garden. It's gone. I can't feel anything
22174,Caroline, I don't understand
22175,Bonnie, Witches have a connection to the earth. We can literally feel nature. Life
22176,Bonnie," When Abby became a vampire, she lost it. I don't know how to help her"
22177,Damon, Rebekah's up to something. She's been snooping around in places she shouldn't be
22178,Alaric," Tell me again, why are we here?"
22179,Damon," Ric, the world can't stop just because you're an accidental psycho k*ll"
22180,Meredith, Do you have any tact whatsoever?
22181,Carol, Alaric! I'm glad you're here. Did you bring the sign? The restored wickery bridge sign. The history department promised me you would have it today
22182,Alaric," No, I don't have the sign, actually. It slipped... slipped my mind. I've been... Busy"
22183,Carol," Well, it's not an emergency. We'll just, um, unveil it when the bridge is complete"
22184,Alaric, Get me out of here
22185,Meredith, My pleasure
22186,Damon, I'm going to stick around for a bit
22187,Alaric, Who is that?
22188,Damon, Blast from the past
22189,Carol," ... construction has g*n replacing the original wooden support structure to meet modern safety standards. And, our beautification phase will begin in the spring"
22190,Sage, Damon Salvatore. My favorite student
22191,Damon," Sage, my hottest teacher. What are you doing here?"
22192,Sage, I'm just passing through
22193,Damon," Oh, come on. No one just passes through Mystic Falls"
22194,Rebekah, Look what the cat dragged in
22195,Damon," Easy there, Rebekah. You know, she used to b*at men for sport"
22196,Rebekah, She always was quite common
22197,Sage, Rebekah. What a happy surprise
22198,Rebekah," What are you doing here, Sage?"
22199,Sage," Well, I heard Finn was finally freed from that casket your rageaholic brother Klaus carted him around in"
22200,Rebekah," Oh, Finn. You just missed him. He left town and didn't tell us where he was going"
22201,Sage, Oh. He probably went looking for me
22202,Rebekah," Or, quite possibly, he forgot all about you"
22203,Sage, I doubt that
22204,Rebekah, Oh? Because he didn't seem to mention you. Sorry you came all this way for nothing. Have a nice life
22205,Sage," God, I hate that ugly elitist original bitch"
22206,Elena, Hi
22207,Stefan, Hey
22208,Elena, I'm sorry. Damon told Alaric that there was no one home. Otherwise i would have...
22209,Stefan, I just got home
22210,Elena, I just came by to pick up this book that you found on my ancestor Samantha
22211,Stefan, That's fine
22212,Elena," Uh, how are you doing? Damon said that you were..."
22213,Stefan," yeah, I'm, uh, I'm OK. Did you get everything you need?"
22214,Elena," Yeah. Well, if there's anything I can do to help..."
22215,Stefan," You don't have to read that, you know. I can just tell you what happened. Samantha Gilbert was committed to an insane asylum. She tried to give herself a lobotomy with a knitting needle. And bled to death on the floor of her cell. If the same thing is happening to Alaric, then there's... Nothing you can do"
22216,Elena," OK, well... I'm going to let you get back to, uh, whatever it was you were doing"
22217,Damon, Finn? Really?
22218,Sage, He's my one true love. He turned me so we could be together forever. Then Klaus daggered him and locked him away and I've been waiting ever since. Please don't tell me that you and Rebekah are friends
22219,Damon," Ah, not unless you count the hate sex"
22220,Sage, Good. 'Cause her and Klaus always treated me like some peasant whore
22221,Damon," Ah, she's just lurking around because she wants something from me. I can't figure out what it is, though"
22222,Sage, Why don't you get inside her head and find it?
22223,Damon, Because it's impossible. She's too strong
22224,Sage, I bet I can get in there
22225,Damon," Sage, she's an original. It's not going to happen"
22226,Sage," Have you forgotten everything I taught you? Rebekah may be an original, but she's a girl. You find her weakness and exploit it, and I'll walk right in. That is, if you want my help"
22227,Damon, Anyone ever tell you you're sexy when you're bitchy?
22228,Rebekah," We're talking now, are we? Because you were quite rude the other day. Using me to help you with Stefan, and then shooing me away like a stray dog"
22229,Damon," Ah, that was brother business. You can't hold that against me. Besides, I really did"
22230,Rebekah, You were mean
22231,Damon, You like mean
22232,Rebekah, No. I don't
22233,Damon," No? You didn't get a thrill back there pushing Sage down, crushing her dreams of true love?"
22234,Rebekah, Maybe a little
22235,Damon, See? Mean. Can Sage and I interest you in a drink back at the house?
22236,Rebekah, Not a chance in hell
22237,Damon, You know what they say. Two's company. Three is a party. OK. Enjoy the rest of your day
22238,Caroline, Haven't seen you up at the house. Abby's been asking for you
22239,Jamie, I've been pretty busy
22240,Jamie," Hey, hey! Stay away from me! Easy!"
22241,Caroline, I was just going to help you carry the firewood up! You're scared of her
22242,Jamie, She's a vampire
22243,Caroline, She's a vampire. She needs to feel connected to the people she loves. She needs to feel normal right now...
22244,Jamie, she's not normal. None of this is normal
22245,Caroline," Well, Abby didn't choose this. This was forced on her. She could have let herself die but she didn't. She's trying to make this work so she can be there for you, and for Bonnie, so..."
22246,Caroline, So just get over yourself!
22247,Caroline," Hey, what's going on?"
22248,Elena, Bonnie's not returning my of my calls
22249,Caroline," Sorry. She's still mad. And, seriously, Abby's transition has been a little rough, so she's got"
22250,Elena," I know. And I get it. But... Something really terrible is happening to Ric, and I really need her help "
22251,Meredith, I really don't think you should be looking through that stuff
22252,Alaric," Well, it's the truth. Restraining orders and all. My life in a series of police reports"
22253,Meredith," You don't strike me as an angry guy. Which sounds weird, given everything. But... You don't"
22254,Alaric," Yeah, well, I was stupid when I was younger. But listen, it's not like these guys didn't have it coming. I mean... This guy here broke a beer bottle over a bartender's head. And this guy... Hit his girlfriend. And this guy... OK, this guy was just a douche. Everyone needs to find a way to deal with their dark side. Some people meditate. I became a vampire hunter"
22255,Meredith," Mmm, semi-retired"
22256,Alaric," Listen, there's something that's not in these reports that I need to tell you about"
22257,Meredith, Ok... Ominous. sh**t
22258,Alaric," Your cousin Logan Fell, the one who was vampire slayed... I did the slaying"
22259,Meredith," The vampire thing... It's not my fight. I use their bl*od for what I need and leave the judgment to everyone else. Although, I have kind of been wondering why you never drew a stake through Damon's heart"
22260,Alaric," I tried once. He k*ll me. Yeah. Yeah, figures. The thing that started all this ring stuff was me being angry enough to think I could take on a vampire in the first place"
22261,Damon," Oh, come on. Slow down, brother. Control, remember? Doesn't matter whether it's blondes or bl*od bags, same principles apply"
22262,Stefan, What did you say to Elena this morning?
22263,Damon," Oh, you're stress eating. Sublimating. You need to observe each other while you're pining and moping"
22264,Stefan," I asked you a question, Damon"
22265,Damon," I told her what she already knows... you're a vampire and you drink human bl*od. And to get over it. Which is the same thing I'm telling you. Own it, live it, love it. Stop being ashamed of who you are"
22266,Stefan," Do me a favor, Damon... next time you talk to Elena, keep me out of it, OK?"
22267,Damon," Gladly. Now, unless you're interested in a Sage-Rebekah sex sandwich, I suggest you make yourself... Scarce"
22268,Bonnie," Who are you, again?"
22269,Jamie," The guy who lives out back. You know, the one you're not related to"
22270,Bonnie, Right
22271,Jamie, Caroline and I had a little talk
22272,Bonnie, Sounds like code for Caroline lectured you
22273,Jamie, Maybe. But I needed it. Abby's always been there for me. Now it's my turn. Thought I could build a fire
22274,Bonnie, Please. Maybe it'll distract everyone from my crappy cooking
22275,Abby, Jamie...
22276,Jamie," I'm so sorry, Abby. I'm sorry about everything"
22277,Bonnie, Abby!
22278,Sage, Remember this song?
22279,Damon," All right, miss master seductress, where's our v*ctim?"
22280,Sage," Patience. Between her craving for affection and her pathological fear of being left alone, our little get together is too tempting to resist"
22281,Damon," Finn's gone, you know"
22282,Sage, I choose to believe otherwise
22283,Damon," He strung you along for 900 years, didn't bother to call. He's gone"
22284,Sage," You know, the Damon I knew was holding out for someone, too"
22285,Damon," Yes, he was. Hope's a bitch, Sage. Get out while you can"
22286,Sage, The sweet chime of desperation
22287,Rebekah," I stole it from Nik who stole it from a queen. I'm not sure which one. Well, this is depressing. What happened to the party?"
22288,Sage, It just arrived
22289,Damon, How about a duet
22290,Rebekah, What about her?
22291,Damon, I don't want her. I want you
22292,Abby, I almost k*ll him!
22293,Bonnie," Caroline said that this kind of thing happens a lot at first, when you're still..."
22294,Abby," no, no. I should just go right now, before I hurt Jamie again, or you!"
22295,Bonnie, The only way you're going to hurt me is if you leave. Don't give up on this. Not again. We can make this work
22296,Caroline, He's fine. Nothing a little vampire bl*od can't cure
22297,Abby, Thank You
22298,Caroline, Now I need a favor
22299,Alaric," Listen, I want you to have this. This is a list of my bank accounts, passwords, where to find my will and how to contact my family just in case this doesn't go my way"
22300,Elena," No, no, don't even think like that"
22301,Alaric," Elena, I need to know that you and Jeremy are going to be OK"
22302,Elena, We're all going to be fine
22303,Elena, Caroline?
22304,Caroline, So Abby thinks Bonnie can reverse the damage with a spell. I guess the same thing happens with witches who become obsessed with dark magic. They lose control and start acting out their darkest impulses
22305,Elena, Thank you so much
22306,Caroline," I'm going to hang back here with Abby, but Bonnie's leaving now, so if... um, hold on"
22307,Bonnie, I need a personal effect of Alaric's. Something he wore before he started wearing the ring
22308,Elena," OK. I'll get it. Um... Bonnie, I'm so sorry for everything. Thank you for doing this"
22309,Bonnie, Be ready to do the spell as soon as I get there. We have to work fast. I'll see you soon
22310,Alaric," Good news, bad news?"
22311,Elena, Bonnie thinks that she can help you with a spell
22312,Alaric," Well, it's worth a try"
22313,Elena, But she needs something that you wore before you put on the ring. Something personal
22314,Alaric," Well, there's, uh... My wedding ring. It's at the loft"
22315,Elena," OK, yeah. Um, that's a good idea"
22316,Meredith, I think it's better if you stay here with me
22317,Alaric," Oh, you and your tranquilizers. It's in the dresser by the kitchen. It's in, uh, an aspirin bottle. Probably covered in cobwebs"
22318,Elena, Ok
22319,Damon, I take it back. Your plan is amazing
22320,Sage," I told you, if you got her comfortable enough... She's an open book"
22321,Damon," Well, are you going to torture me or are you going to tell me what she's up to?"
22322,Sage, I'd rather show you
22323,Damon, There's another tree
22324,Sage, Milling records?
22325,Damon, Our family made one of its many fortunes selling lumber. That's why Rebekah's been digging around about this stuff. That tree was on our land and milled by our yard. The letters will tell me where it was shipped. The business archives should be around here somewhere. Get upstairs. Make sure you keep her distracted
22326,Damon, You've got to be kidding me
22327,Stefan, Missed you at the house. Alaric told me you'd be here
22328,Elena," You made yourself perfectly clear this morning, Stefan"
22329,Stefan," You don't want to be around me. I'm not trying to hurt you, Elena. I just can't be who you want be to be right now. I'm not in control"
22330,Elena, So then what are you doing here?
22331,Stefan," Well, I, uh, did a little more digging on Samantha Gilbert. Founding family's were always pretty good about it, about destroying their records, but I found a couple of newspaper articles. Seems she k*ll two people while she was in the institution. A nurse and a guard"
22332,Elena, So she was a psychopath. I get it
22333,Stefan, She was under su1c1de watch. No personal effects. No jewelry
22334,Elena," Wait, so you're saying that the violent behavior can still happen even if the person isn't wearing the ring?"
22335,Meredith, Still with me?
22336,Alaric," Yeah. Yeah, I'm still with you"
22337,Meredith," I'm half-dead, too. Neither one of us has slept in two days. Don't worry... I've got coffee on"
22338,Sage, Rebekah just left
22339,Damon," Happy, I hope"
22340,Sage, Did you find what you were looking for?
22341,Damon," Yep. In 1912, the Salvatore milling company chopped down a forest. Its most valuable wood came from an old white oak tree that was used to make the wickery bridge. These aren't public records, so Rebekah's going to chase her tail for a long time"
22342,Sage, So all the wood stripped from the underside of that bridge is basically a w*apon that could k*ll an original
22343,Damon, Yep
22344,Sage," You see how this could be a problem for me, right?"
22345,Damon, Why? Because of your true love Finn? Let me tell you something... I've met the guy. You're not going to miss him
22346,Sage, I will rip your head off in two seconds if you take one more step
22347,Damon," All right, let's make a deal. You want me to k*ll Rebekah, I consider Finn untouchable, you guys walk into the sunset together"
22348,Sage, Is that a promise?
22349,Damon, Yes. It's a promise
22350,Stefan," If Bonnie's spell doesn't work, ,what are you going to do with him?"
22351,Elena," I'm not going to do anything ,Stefan. I'm going to keep looking until we can find something that will help him"
22352,Stefan, You don't know how long this has been going on. It might be too late
22353,Elena, It's my family's ring that's doing this to him. It's my responsibility to fix it
22354,Stefan, You can't put that on yourself. Not everyone is your responsibility. Not everyone can be saved
22355,Elena, Are we talking about Alaric here? Or are we talking about you? Because I wasn't planning on giving up on either of you
22356,Elena, What is that?
22357,Stefan, Pictures of his v*ctim
22358,Damon," age, let's go. We have originals to k*ll"
22359,Damon, Sage...
22360,Elena," ""Jeremy, if anything happens to me, carry on my work. You have the other ring, let the ring make you strong. The council must be cleansed before the work can begin."""
22361,Stefan, It's the founders council roster. Looks like some sort of hit list
22362,Elena," No, Alaric didn't write this"
22363,Stefan," Who else would have written it, Elena?"
22364,Elena, I have to get back
22365,Alaric, Looking for something?
22366,Meredith," I don't know where anything is in this house. I'm sorry, I can't remember, do you take cream?"
22367,Alaric, No cream
22368,Meredith, I was going to make sandwiches. I am starving
22369,Alaric, Can I ask you a question?
22370,Meredith, No mustard. I hate mustard
22371,Alaric, Do you ever feel remorse?
22372,Meredith, Sorry?
22373,Alaric," Well... You are a council member. And the council was formed to protect the people of this town from vampires, yet here you all are, just looking the other way; ignoring your responsibilities. Like you, and your vampire bl*od. So I'm asking you. Do you ever feel remorse? Because you should"
22374,Rebekah," Your grand plans always seem to get ruined, don't they? Sorry to disappoint you. Again"
22375,Damon, You set me up
22376,Sage, No. I'm just looking out for myself
22377,Damon, I told you I'd save your creepy boyfriend!
22378,Sage," And you lied to me, Damon! The originals are linked. If one dies, they all die. If I can get inside her head, don't think I'd be able to get inside yours?"
22379,Damon, I should and you
22380,Sage," I'm 900 years old, Damon. You're not capable of ending me. Do you really think that I would risk Finn's life for one of your petty revenge fantasies?"
22381,Damon," Let me tell you something... your long lost love has a su1c1de wish. So when mama witch linked them together in a spell, he's the one who volunteered to die"
22382,Sage, He wouldn't do that
22383,Damon," He didn't want to live. Not for you, not for anyone. He doesn't love you, Sage. And when I do find another way to k*ll those originals, I'll start with Finn"
22384,Alaric, Hey there
22385,Elena, Hi. Where's Meredith?
22386,Alaric," Oh, she got called in to the hospital for a last minute surgery, but she'll be back later"
22387,Elena, What happened?
22388,Alaric," Oh, I... Broke a coffee cup and sliced my hand open trying to pick up the pieces. But I'll... I'll live. Did Stefan catch up with you?"
22389,Elena, No
22390,Alaric, Did you get my ring?
22391,Elena, I... I couldn't find it
22392,Alaric," Yeah, well, my place is a bit of a disaster. I guess I'll, uh, I'll just have to go get it"
22393,Elena," No, don't hurt him!"
22394,Stefan, I'll try not to
22395,Stefan," Elena, I need you to come upstairs with me"
22396,Elena, Why?
22397,Stefan, I'm going to need your help
22398,Elena," Meredith! OK, OK. You're going to be OK"
22399,Alaric, What the hell are you doing here?
22400,Damon, Just making sure the witch didn't turn you into a toad or a block of salt. Bonnie did a little spell. It's nothing to worry about. Just something to keep the k*ll in you at bay
22401,Alaric, Did something happen?
22402,Damon," Let's just say you've got an alter ego hell bent on k*ll council members. So we're going to pack up some of your stuff, we're going to go to the loft, just for a little bit. You know, it's like house arrest, light"
22403,Alaric," Wait, where's Meredith?"
22404,Damon," She'll be fine, Ric"
22405,Bonnie, Hey. You OK?
22406,Elena," Yeah, I'm fine"
22407,Bonnie," Abby says that all the dying and coming back to life might have chipped away at Alaric's psyche, making it easier for the darkness to take hold. These herbs are the binding element of the spell. He needs to take them twice a day. I'll get you more. Abby and I are going to work on the garden"
22408,Elena, How is she doing?
22409,Bonnie," The transition's been hard, but I think she'll be OK. Eventually. I'm going to go back and stay with her for a while. It'll give us a chance to work things through"
22410,Elena," I'm sorry, Bonnie. I didn't... I didn't want this to happen. If there's anything that I can do to make it different, I..."
22411,Bonnie, I know
22412,Elena, Please say that you forgive me
22413,Bonnie, Of course I do
22414,Caroline, Am I even doing this right?
22415,Jamie," Yeah, you're doing fine. Hey, um, thanks for helping out with Abby. Bonnie's really lucky to have a friend like you"
22416,Caroline, Well... I went through the same thing once. Ahem. With my dad. But it didn't really work out. So... You know...
22417,Caroline," Well, when Bonnie gets back, she can snap her fingers or wave her hands or whatever, and make the herbs bloom. I think Abby's up"
22418,Caroline, What are you doing? You're leaving. You kidding me?
22419,Abby, I have to. I don't know how to do this
22420,Caroline," Do what? Be a vampire or a parent?Because I can help you be a vampire. I can teach you self control. But being a parent, I mean, that's all you. Bonnie grew up without a mom because you ran away once. But now you have an eternity to make up for it and you're just going to throw that away?"
22421,Abby, She's better off without me!
22422,Caroline," No, she's not! No one is better off without their parents. She wants to make this work. Please. Just stay"
22423,Abby, Tell them I'm sorry
22424,Jeremy, Hello?
22425,Elena," Hey, stranger"
22426,Jeremy," Hey, you checking up on me? "
22427,Elena, Do you need checking up on?
22428,Jeremy," Well, I'm not flunking any of my classes. Yet. And I got a dog"
22429,Elena," Hey, have you talked to Alaric lately?"
22430,Jeremy," Uh, no, why? Is everything OK?"
22431,Elena," Yeah, everything is fine. Um, I just wanted to hear your voice"
22432,Jeremy," OK. Hey, can I call you later? I'm actually on my way out with some friends "
22433,Elena," Yeah, um, of course, Jer. Go out. Go have fun and, um... I... I just miss you"
22434,Jeremy," Yeah. Yeah, I miss you, too"
22435,Damon," Little early in the day for you, isn't it?"
22436,Stefan, Just having a little toast
22437,Damon, To what?
22438,Stefan, Control
22439,Damon," You're happy, I'm happy"
22440,Stefan," Why are you in such a good mood? Sage double crossed you, tree's a pile of Ash, Alaric's got a psychopathic alter ego"
22441,Damon," You know, Stefan, I'm a philanthropist. I make the world a better place. Restoring bridges, landmarks, and..."
22442,Damon, Historical signs made of the same white oak as the wickery bridge
22443,Stefan, They think all the wood b*rned
22444,Damon, I sold my rage. Phew. You should have seen me
22445,Stefan, We have a w*apon
22446,Damon," Game's back on, brother. Let's go k*ll some originals"
22447,Damon," Morning, sunshine."
22448,Elena, Hey. How's Alaric?
22449,Damon," Indecent, but fine"
22450,Elena, So then does that mean there were no issues last night?
22451,Damon, Nope. Slept like a baby. Woke up Alaric. No headlines about dead council members
22452,Elena, Then why do I feel like you're hiding something from me?
22453,Damon," Well, maybe because you're being all paranoid and control freak-y. What'd you bring me?"
22454,Damon, Chocolate muffins. You know what they say... the way to a psycho k*ll's heart is through his stomach
22455,Elena, They're not for you
22456,Damon," Fine. Keep convincing yourself you're still mad at me. But sadly, Ric's going to have to pass on Elena time today. You know, lockdown and all"
22457,Elena," Just take it, give it to him and tell him that I miss him, ok?"
22458,Damon, With pleasure
22459,Elena, Please
22460,Damon, Have a great day
22461,Elena, Dam...
22462,Damon, thanks for coming by
22463,Damon, Walking down the stairs. Opening front door and... She's gone
22464,Stefan, Needs to have a sharper point
22465,Damon, Got it
22466,Stefan, Finally have our own stakes to k*ll an original. I'm not going to miss because you can't whittle
22467,Damon, I said I got it. Stop micro managing
22468,Alaric, Looks like you guys got this under control. I'm going to call the sheriff. I want to turn myself in
22469,Damon," No, you don't"
22470,Alaric," I have a homicidal alter ego. Unlike some people in this room, I would like to take responsibility for the people I've k*ll"
22471,Damon," If you wanted to turn yourself in, you wouldn't be saying it out loud. Just sayin'"
22472,Alaric," Listen, of all the people, you cannot psychoanalyze me. I k*ll Caroline's father. I nearly k*ll Meredith. Everything has changed"
22473,Stefan, You're not turning yourself in. Bonnie's herbs are working and we have originals to k*ll
22474,Damon, His morals get very questionable when he has revenge on the brain
22475,Stefan," Klaus needs to die, we finally have a chance to k*ll him. So you are not turning yourself in"
22476,Damon," Here's your ring, Ric. Put it on"
22477,Alaric, That ring is the reason I've k*ll people
22478,Damon," It's also the reason you're alive. You're going vampire hunting, Ric. Wear it"
22479,Caroline, Alaric Saltzman k*ll my father?
22480,Elena," I can't expect you to be ok with this. But at least these herbs that Bonnie's giving him, they're healing him and they're keeping the dark side buried"
22481,Caroline," Yeah, and that's supposed to make everything ok?"
22482,Elena," No, Caroline, it's not ok. It's horrible. And I feel horrible about it, but... He's a v*ctim of something supernatural. He didn't ask for this. It just happened to him. Just like Bonnie's mom. I mean, she didn't ask to become a vampire. And... Neither did Stefan, or Tyler"
22483,Caroline, Or me
22484,Elena, Or you. None of you asked for this. But who would I be if I just... Turned my back on any of you?
22485,Caroline," Oh, Elena Gilbert. Savior of the cursed and the damned"
22486,Matt," Hey. What's with the, uh, cryptic secret meeting text?"
22487,Elena, I don't know. Stefan just said to meet here
22488,Stefan," Where's Bonnie? Texted her, too"
22489,Caroline," Uh, Bonnie's mom bailed on her. Again. So I think we should leave her out of this one"
22490,Matt, What are we doing here?
22491,Damon, We found some more white oak. Long story. Wait for the movie
22492,Elena, Hang on. White oak? You have a w*apon that can k*ll Klaus?
22493,Stefan, Nope. We all have a w*apon
22494,Klaus," Hello, Finn"
22495,Finn," Hello, Niklaus. I have nothing to say to you"
22496,Klaus," I'm not here to chat. I will ask you one thing, though, where's our mother?"
22497,Finn," Gone to find another way to end our abominable lives. And when she does, I will sacrifice myself all over again"
22498,Klaus, How fortunate that I found you. I require your assistance
22499,Finn, I have no wish to help you. Only to see you dead
22500,Klaus," Well, that's the thing. You see, you won't be able to see me dead because if I die, then you die, so it's a wish unfulfilled"
22501,Finn," Oh, bother someone else with your hollow charms, Niklaus"
22502,Klaus, Why? When I can bother my big brother? I need you to accompany me back to Mystic Falls. I have a witch there who can help undo Esther's spell that linked us together
22503,Finn, I have no wish to be unlinked!
22504,Klaus, Again with the wishes. Let me rephrase... you will come back with me or I will put you back in that coffin in which you rotted for 900 years
22505,Finn," What happens to one happens to all. You may not feel the effects of the dagger, but you'd lose your precious Rebekah"
22506,Klaus, Wouldn't be the first time
22507,Rebekah," Let's not make this any worse than it has to be, darling brother"
22508,Finn," You're siding with him? Rebekah, he stored us in boxes"
22509,Rebekah, At least he's not trying to make us extinct
22510,Finn, What are you going to do? k*ll me?
22511,Klaus," Oh, yeah, that's right, you've got a death wish. Fine. Pathetic, but fine. The thing is, I'm not going to have you take the rest of us down with you"
22512,Stefan," Klaus has always been one step ahead of us. But now we have the advantage. We're all armed, and they are all linked. Meaning we only need to k*ll one of them. We need to seize the best opportunity, which means we need to prepare for every opportunity"
22513,Damon, Scenario number one...
22514,Damon, you are to play Klaus
22515,Elena, Ok
22516,Stefan," Rebekah is our target. So we'll distract her and catch her off guard. To do that, we need to keep Klaus separate and occupied. Caroline?"
22517,Caroline, Why do I always have to be Klaus bait?
22518,Damon," Because he's obsessed with you. But for right now, we need you to play Rebekah. We'll use the quarterback to distract her. Just keep her talking"
22519,Matt, How
22520,Damon, Act interested. She's lonely. Desperate
22521,Caroline, Clearly. She slept with you
22522,Damon," Beefcake holds b*mb, I come up from behind her, grab her arms like this..."
22523,Caroline, Ow!
22524,Stefan, Which gives me time for one sh*t. Got it? Good
22525,Stefan," So we all have one stake, we keep it hidden and we look out for any opportunity we have"
22526,Damon, No last minute attacks of pity for any of them
22527,Elena, Don't worry about me. Not after what happened to Bonnie's mom
22528,Damon, Barbie?
22529,Caroline," Oh, I'm ready. Anything that will free Tyler of his sire bond to Klaus"
22530,Damon, Bus boy?
22531,Matt, Do I have a choice?
22532,Damon, Good point
22533,Stefan," We have 12 stakes. 12 shots at k*ll one original. We can do this. All right, let's try another scenario"
22534,Stefan," Elena, grab a crossbow. Matt, you play Klaus"
22535,Rebekah, Gather your witch. Let's get his bl*od and get on with it
22536,Finn, You can't force me to help you
22537,Klaus," Oh, I most likely could. But why force when I can persuade?"
22538,Sage," Hello, Finn"
22539,Finn, Sage!
22540,Rebekah, What do you know? True love prevails
22541,Klaus, It does occasionally have its uses. Easier than torturing him
22542,Rebekah, I have something to do. What do you need from me for this spell?
22543,Klaus, Just your bl*od and your blessing. Where are you going?
22544,Rebekah, I have some unfinished business with Damon Salvatore. Ask Sage what he did to me. And you'll understand why retribution is in order
22545,Alaric," I mean, did you learn nothing from the moon stone in the soap dish?"
22546,Damon, Why? Where'd you put yours?
22547,Damon, What the hell was that?
22548,Damon, Ric?
22549,Rebekah," Hello, lover"
22550,Elena," Bonnie, we're starting to worry about you. Call me back. Or call Caroline. Just call someone, please"
22551,Matt, Mr. Saltzman was like the most normal guy in town
22552,Elena, Is it weird that Bonnie's not returning my calls?
22553,Matt, Is it weird that Klaus' brother is in the middle of town square?
22554,Elena, That's Finn. I thought he left town
22555,Sage, So can you guess why I dragged you out here?
22556,Finn," If memory serves me, this is where the natives used to make sacrifices to their gods"
22557,Sage, This statue was built where we used to rendezvous back when you used to have to sneak away from your siblings to see your tawdry lady friend
22558,Finn, I assumed after 900 years you've moved on
22559,Sage," I took care of myself. But I never stopped loving you, Finn. I don't want you to die"
22560,Stefan, Hey
22561,Elena," Hey, where are you?"
22562,Stefan, I just got home. Why?
22563,Elena, Klaus' brother Finn is in the town square. He's with some ex-girlfriend or something
22564,Stefan, Ex-girlfriend? Guy's been in a coffin for the last 900 years. Sage. It's got to be Sage. 
22565,Elena, We have an opportunity. So how do we do this?
22566,Stefan," Listen to me, Elena. Do not do anything, ok? Sage is very old and very strong. You don't stand a chance against her"
22567,Elena, Then get Damon and get down here
22568,Stefan (looking at Alaric), What the hell happened to you?
22569,Elena, Stefan...
22570,Alaric, Rebekah happened
22571,Stefan (to Elena) , I think we have a problem
22572,Rebekah," I found them in the shed. What kind of monster would trap a poor, defenseless animal?"
22573,Damon," Got to admit, even for me, it's a little kinky"
22574,Rebekah," You pretended to be interested in me. And then you slept with me so your trampy friend Sage could steal my thoughts. Ever since then, I've felt this incessant need to one-up you. So I've decided to bleed the vervain from your system"
22575,Damon, Oh
22576,Damon, You want to compel me to be your boyfriend?
22577,Rebekah," Actually, I'd rather compel you to k*ll your brother. Or Elena. But, since vampires heal, bleeding you may take a while. We should probably stick to the major arteries"
22578,Klaus," Well... Look what you caught. If you're trying to bleed him of vervain, don't you think it would be easier to hang him upside down?"
22579,Rebekah," I'm perfectly capable of inflicting pain, thank you very much"
22580,Klaus," Oh, well, excuse me. It's not like I have any expertise in the matter"
22581,Rebekah," You know, why don't you just leave me be and go and manage your witch?"
22582,Rebekah," Mmm. Now, where were we?"
22583,Klaus, Tick tock. I should hear chanting by now
22584,Bonnie," I'm still studying the unlinking spell. It's not that easy, especially under duress"
22585,Klaus," You've been warned. If you're looking for a way to send for help, I will k*ll anyone who comes to your rescue"
22586,Bonnie, This is the spell. I just don't know if I'm strong enough
22587,Klaus," Then you should have a little more faith in yourself, Bonnie. Your energy helped my mother link us. Honestly, I think someone isn't trying very hard. Very well"
22588,Klaus, Kol. How's the weather up there in mile high city? And how's our friend?
22589,Klaus, That's him. There's Jeremy. Playing fetch with his new puppy. Isn't that just the most adorable thing you've ever seen?
22590,Klaus," Thank you, Kol. We'll be in touch"
22591,Klaus," So, Bonnie. How about that spell?"
22592,Caroline, Hey. I hear you had a run in with Buffy the vampire
22593,Alaric," Yeah, I'll live. What are you doing here?"
22594,Caroline, Checking up on you. In case you're... Not you
22595,Alaric, I'm me
22596,Caroline," I guess not-you would say that, too. Which is why... Elena said you have to drink this"
22597,Caroline, I hope it tastes better than it smells
22598,Alaric, It doesn't
22599,Alaric, Mmm. That's disgusting. 
22600,Caroline," It's either that or k*ll people, so... Elena told me everything"
22601,Alaric, Caroline... I am so sorry. I don't even know what else I can say
22602,Caroline," Right after I turned into a vampire, I k*ll someone. A stranger. I just... k*ll him. And what's worse is, I liked it. I have bl*od on my hands, too. You know, we all do"
22603,Alaric," Yeah, but the bl*od on my hands is your father's"
22604,Caroline," Yeah, it is. And maybe the guy I k*ll was someone's father, too. Look... All I know is, I'm no better than you. So I'm going to take a page from the Elena Gilbert handbook and choose to believe that you can be saved. Ok?"
22605,Alaric, Ok
22606,Elena, Hey. How is he?
22607,Stefan," Hey. He's just banged up. Caroline's going to stay with him; Make sure Alaric stays Alaric. Matt texted me, he said Finn is still in the grill. We need to plan our next move"
22608,Elena," Wait, wait, Rebekah has Damon. Our next move should be finding him"
22609,Stefan," No, we need to stay on point. See an original, k*ll an original. That's the plan"
22610,Elena," Yeah, that was the plan before Damon's life was hanging in the balance"
22611,Stefan," Look, Elena, I understand that you're concerned about my brother's life, but if he even knew for one second that we were talking about missing a chance to k*ll these people, he would lose his mind"
22612,Elena," Yeah, and if the roles were reversed, he would stop everything to save you"
22613,Stefan, I know what my brother would want
22614,Elena, What he would want and what we should do are two different things
22615,Stefan, You going to help me with this or not?
22616,Stefan, Ok. I'll figure it out myself
22617,Damon, What are you doing? Rebekah will k*ll you
22618,Elena, Then hurry up and... and tell me what to do
22619,Damon, Open. Carefully
22620,Elena," Come on, come on. We have to keep going, Damon"
22621,Damon, I need a minute
22622,Elena," No, look at me. Look at me"
22623,Damon," Don't be an idiot, Elena"
22624,Elena, I am not going to leave you. Damon?
22625,Elena, Damon. Drink. Drink
22626,Damon, Ohh. Bitch
22627,Rebekah," It's not fun when someone messes with your thoughts, is it?"
22628,Damon," Actually, I was having a pretty good time in there"
22629,Rebekah," Well, I hope you are nicer to Elena than you are to me"
22630,Damon," Oh, come on. I couldn't hurt you that bad. You didn't think I really had a thing for you, did you? I get it. If Klaus bossed me around for a thousand years, I'd probably be pretty desperate for attention, too"
22631,Bonnie, Who was that?
22632,Klaus," I wouldn't let it bother you, love"
22633,Bonnie," Well, it does bother me. You bother me. The way you use people to get what you want. It's not right"
22634,Klaus," You're being emotional, Bonnie. I understand that things have been rough for you. You know,"
22635,Klaus," Elijah, Rebekah, Kol, Finn"
22636,Klaus, Where do you want us?
22637,Sage," You've never had tequila before? That's embarrassing. Seriously, I'm embarrassed for you"
22638,Finn, Happy now?
22639,Sage, Lime
22640,Finn, I'm truly awed by the evolution of mankind
22641,Man, Hey Sage
22642,Sage, Hey Troy
22643,Finn, You know him?
22644,Sage, I turned him
22645,Finn, You turned him. Why?
22646,Sage," Because I'm in enemy territory. When your brother and sister called, I thought I might need a little back-up. You can't trust anyone here"
22647,Sage, Two more tequilas?
22648,Matt," All right, cool, I'll let your waitress know"
22649,Finn, How many people have you turned?
22650,Sage," I don't know. A lot. Don't judge me, Finn. You turned me"
22651,Finn," Exactly, Sage. I turned you. My passion overtook my morals"
22652,Sage, My passions overtake my morals on a daily basis. It's called living life to the fullest
22653,Sage, Finally. Oh thanks
22654,Sage, To living life to the fullest
22655,Finn, To living life
22656,Sage," Oh, what the hell!"
22657,Finn, Vervain
22658,Sage," Finn, the stake!"
22659,Rebekah," Oh, leaving so soon?"
22660,Klaus, Sister. Be nice.
22661,Rebekah," Thank you, Bonnie. See you in physics class"
22662,Bonnie, Oh my god
22663,Klaus," Yeah, you'll have to excuse the mess. Apparently Damon hurt her feelings"
22664,Damon, Bonnie...
22665,Klaus, Go on. Help him. Save the man who turned your mother into a vampire
22666,Bonnie, Just get me out of here
22667,Klaus, Very well
22668,Elena, Hey. How's Alaric?
22669,Caroline," He'll be ok. I gave him a bottle of Bonnie's herbs, and he went home. Oh, did you guys k*ll Finn? Did it work?"
22670,Stefan, Nothing worked until I see Klaus' dead body myself
22671,Elena," Bonnie, where have you been?"
22672,Bonnie, Klaus has Damon
22673,Elena, Kl... Klaus should be dead. They should all be dead. We just k*ll Finn
22674,Bonnie," No, Elena. He forced me to do a spell that unlinked all the siblings. He's still alive"
22675,Elena," Ok, Bonnie. Where's Damon?"
22676,Bonnie," At Klaus' mansion. It's bad, Elena. He threatened Jeremy. And my mom..."
22677,Elena, Are... are you ok?
22678,Bonnie," I don't know. I'm sorry, I have to go. I just... I have to... I have to go"
22679,Elena," No, Bonnie, just..."
22680,Stefan," Stay with Caroline, I'll call you when it's over"
22681,Elena," Stefan, stop. Klaus is stronger than you. We need another plan"
22682,Stefan," No, what we need is for Klaus to be dead"
22683,Elena," Stefan, stop it! You're acting on anger!"
22684,Stefan," Anger gets things done, Elena"
22685,Elena, Or it'll get you k*ll and it'll get Damon k*ll along with you
22686,Stefan, Klaus does not get to survive this. Not after everything he took from me
22687,Caroline, I miss well-adjusted Stefan
22688,Sage, Ding dong. I'm not here for you. I'm here for him
22689,Troy, I don't think so
22690,Stefan," I had to k*ll him, Sage"
22691,Sage, Oh. You remember me
22692,Sage, Good. Then you know I like to go all ten rounds
22693,Troy, Sage?
22694,Sage," Troy, help me!"
22695,Sage, What is happening to me?
22696,Elena, She just died
22697,Caroline, So Sage and this Troy guy die within an hour of Finn
22698,Elena," But why? Were they bitten by a hybrid, or..."
22699,Caroline," Hybrid bites don't look like that. Maybe Sage was so in love with Finn, she just died of sadness"
22700,Elena," No, that doesn't explain Troy"
22701,Stefan," It's the bl*od. The bloodline. It has to be. Think about it. Finn turned Sage, Sage turned Troy. They're all part of the same vampire bloodline that originated with Finn"
22702,Caroline," Wait, so, when an original dies, every vampire turned in their bloodline dies along with them? Because... That would mean..."
22703,Elena," If the originals die, so do all of you. The entire vampire species would... Just be dead"
22704,Damon, This was much different in my head
22705,Stefan, Klaus! I'm here! Let's do this
22706,Klaus," Oh, good. A hero. What do you want?"
22707,Stefan, I'm here to make a deal
22708,Damon," Stefan, what are you doing?"
22709,Stefan," Eight stakes, made of white oak. The part of wickery bridge that you forgot to burn"
22710,Rebekah, That's impossible
22711,Stefan," Actually, it's not. Finn's dead"
22712,Rebekah, You k*ll my brother?
22713,Stefan, Damon in exchange for the last eight w*apon that could k*ll you
22714,Klaus, And how do we know there aren't any more left?
22715,Stefan, Because there aren't
22716,Klaus," Let's be certain, shall we?"
22717,Klaus, Leave
22718,Damon, No
22719,Klaus, Come on. Leave
22720,Rebekah," Nik, he's my play thing, not yours"
22721,Klaus, I said... Go. Home
22722,Caroline, Vampire disposal... Not my strong suit. Where did Stefan go?
22723,Elena, Trading the stakes for Damon
22724,Caroline, All of them?
22725,Elena," Not all of them. We still have, uh, enough to k*ll three out of the four of them. If we can figure out who to save"
22726,Caroline, h. How are we supposed to do that?
22727,Elena," I have no idea. You were turned with Damon's bl*od and Damon and Stefan were turned by Katherine, and we know that Katherine was turned by a vampire named Rose"
22728,Caroline," Well, who turned Rose?"
22729,Elena," We don't know. But it can only lead back to one original, and if the odds are in our favor, hopefully it won't be Klaus so we can still k*ll him"
22730,Caroline, Elena... Even if Klaus didn't create our bloodline... We know for a fact that he turned one of us
22731,Elena," Oh, my God. Tyler. If we k*ll Klaus, then Tyler will die"
22732,Klaus," All right, stop. Stop. Stop, before you hurt yourself"
22733,Klaus, Wow. I can see that you can finally be compelled. Now
22734,Klaus," Minus the stake that's in my brother, how many more stakes are out there that can k*ll me?"
22735,Damon, 11
22736,Klaus," 11! Really? So not eight, then. You really shouldn't have lied"
22737,Stefan, I'll get you the other three
22738,Klaus," Yeah, that would be nice. Or since you lied, maybe I'll just compel your brother to chew out his own tongue"
22739,Stefan, What is wrong with you?
22740,Klaus," What is wrong with you?! Do you really have no appreciation for me? I have given you someone to hate; To loathe, a target for all of your anger so you don't have to turn it on yourself. I have given your life a purpose as your friend."
22741,Klaus, I really think you should be thanking me
22742,Klaus, Step down or you'll both die
22743,Klaus, There. Now you'll only have to get me the other two
22744,Rebekah, This is ridiculous
22745,Klaus, What are you doing?
22746,Rebekah, I brought him here. I get to release him. My rules now. Bring us the stakes and you both live. Take your brother as a sign of good faith
22747,Klaus, Bring us the stakes. All of them. Or I'll wage a w*r against everyone you love. I hope I'm being clear
22748,Rebekah, I can't believe Finn is dead
22749,Klaus," Good riddance. He was an embarrassment, Rebekah"
22750,Rebekah, He was still your brother. Mind your tongue
22751,Klaus," Fine. Let's all say a prayer for Finn, who slept in a box longer than he lived as a man. He was a lovesick fool. He's better off in death"
22752,Rebekah, Is that how you would speak of me if I died?
22753,Klaus," Well, you let the Salvatores loose with two stakes that could k*ll us, so I guess we'll find out soon enough. And since when did you have a soft spot for them?"
22754,Rebekah," The Salvatores may fight like dogs, but in the end, they would die for each other. At least they know what family means. You destroyed ours"
22755,Klaus, I wanted a family. They just didn't want me. And now we're unlinked. We're no longer responsible for each other
22756,Rebekah," So, what, are you leaving?"
22757,Klaus," As soon as I get my stakes, I'm gone. I'm going to take Elena and use her bl*od to create a new family... of hybrids"
22758,Rebekah, And if I choose to stay?
22759,Klaus, Then you're just as pathetic as Finn
22760,Elena, Hey
22761,Stefan, Hey
22762,Elena, You haven't said much since you got back home
22763,Stefan, I'll be a ball of sunshine once Damon gets Alaric's stake back. I promise
22764,Elena," You really scared me today. You wouldn't have survived if you went up against Klaus on your own. You know that, right?"
22765,Stefan," Mm-hmm. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore"
22766,Elena, Why?
22767,Stefan, Because he's not worth it. All this time and energy that I've wasted hating him. It was for nothing. It's done. It's over. We lost. I'm right back where I started
22768,Elena," That's not true. Yeah, Klaus dragged you through hell. But you came out the other side. You b*at him by being better than him"
22769,Stefan," And what did I lose in the process? Look, hating Klaus was easy. It allowed me to ignore everything that was happening around me. Everything I let slip away. Now I have to deal with that"
22770,Elena, Stefan...
22771,Stefan," No, just admit it. Admit it to me, Elena. I know you don't owe it to me, but I just need to hear you say it"
22772,Elena, I... I can't. Because it's not true. Stefan... I never stopped loving you
22773,Stefan," I know that. I know you didn't. Even though I did... Everything possible to push you away. It's my fault. It's all my fault. I mean, this was all my fault"
22774,Elena, What are you talking about?
22775,Stefan, I'm talking about the fact that you're also in love with Damon
22776,Elena," What? No. Stefan, I was just..."
22777,Stefan, Hey. I love you. I will always love you. I just want you to look me in the eye and tell me... That you don't feel something for him
22778,Elena, I don't know what I feel
22779,Alaric," Oh, you're still alive"
22780,Damon, Yeah. For now. I need your stake
22781,Alaric, It's right behind these books here
22782,Damon," A bookshelf, really? At least I was trying to be clever about it"
22783,Alaric, Where the hell is it?
22784,Damon," Ha ha. Look harder, Ric"
22785,Alaric," It's not here, Damon"
22786,Damon," Well, maybe you just forgot what shelf you put it on"
22787,Alaric," No, I didn't forget it. It's... I put it right here. A stake doesn't just vanish into thin air!"
22788,Damon," Who else did you tell, Ric?"
22789,Alaric," I didn't tell anybody, Damon. I'm the only..."
22790,Damon, what?
22791,Alaric," I'm the only one who knew about it, Damon"
22792,Damon," Are you telling me that your vampire hating alter ego has a stake that could k*ll an entire line of vampires, possibly mine?"
22793,Alaric, That's exactly what I'm telling you
22794,Elena, Alaric?
22795,Alaric, Yeah? Still me. You know you shouldn't be in here. Defeats the point of the whole being locked in a cellar thing
22796,Elena," Well, you still need the basics. Toothbrush, clothes, some boring books to help you sleep"
22797,Alaric," ""Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde""?"
22798,Elena," What? No, I got... Damon. Thinks he's hilarious"
22799,Alaric, At least one of us still has a sense of humor
22800,Elena," Are you sure that you... I mean, you don't have to be kept in here"
22801,Alaric," Oh, no, this is... Ah, this is the right place for me to be. At least until you guys can convince my highly uncooperative alter ego to confess where I... or...he hid the white oak stake"
22802,Elena, We looked everywhere. You...The other you hid it well
22803,Alaric, What's Klaus going to do if you can't find it?
22804,Elena," It's the only thing that will k*ll him, so... Wage w*r. m*rder people. You know, Klaus stuff. Listen..."
22805,Elena," Stefan is going to watch over you for a little while. Now that Klaus knows where Jeremy is, it's not safe. So... Damon and I are going to go to Denver to pick him up"
22806,Alaric, Why do you say that like you're waiting for me to disapprove?
22807,Elena," I don't know. Me and Damon, traveling across the country"
22808,Alaric," Well, I guess I'm more curious to hear what Stefan has to say about it"
22809,Elena," Actually, it was his idea. He thinks that I have some unresolved feelings for Damon"
22810,Alaric, Do you?
22811,Elena, I guess that's why I'm going on this trip. So I can figure it out
22812,Damon, Did you hear from Klaus?
22813,Stefan," Not yet. I'm sure I will soon, though. He's expecting me to deliver two stakes. I only have one"
22814,Damon," Well, that's going to be disappointing for him"
22815,Stefan, I'll get it out of Alaric. I just need some time
22816,Damon," I like that confidence, Stefan. I don't share it, but I like it"
22817,Stefan, You don't think I can do what it takes?
22818,Damon," Well, you're good Stefan again. You're in control. Sorry, you might get the girl but you lose the edge. Speaking of..."
22819,Damon, Have you ever flown first class?
22820,Elena, Who did you have to compel for that?
22821,Damon, Please. I used miles
22822,Elena, Stefan...
22823,Stefan, Be safe
22824,Caroline, What is this?
22825,Matt," It's the decade dance. Remember, you made us sign up to help"
22826,Caroline, No.
22827,Caroline, This. The twenties! We're doing the seventies
22828,Rebekah," It's too flashy, people. It's supposed to be a speakeasy, not the world's fair"
22829,Rebekah," Oh, good, you're here. We need help setting up the tables, so get to it"
22830,Caroline, What do you think you're doing?
22831,Rebekah, Somebody has to be in charge
22832,Caroline," Yeah, me. I'm the chair of the dance committee. The theme of the decade dance is the 1970s"
22833,Rebekah," So you'd rather dress in tacky colors with bad hair than be a classic flapper from the jazz age. Honestly, I don't know what my brother sees in you"
22834,Caroline," Well, maybe he sees a challenge. See, unlike some other people, I don't sleep with everyone I make eye contact with"
22835,Matt, Maybe we can do both decades
22836,Rebekah," No. Go on, Matt, don't be a coward. You know you loved my twenties idea when I presented it to the group"
22837,Caroline, Traitor!
22838,Matt," Bell bottoms and disco? I don't know, this just seemed cooler"
22839,Rebekah," See, it's just cooler"
22840,Caroline, Whatever. Have fun at your stupid dance
22841,Matt, Caroline! Wait!
22842,Caroline, Impressive. You sold it
22843,Matt, And you bought yourself a day
22844,Caroline, Thank you. Just... keep her occupied. Be careful
22845,Matt," You, too. And, uh... Tell him I said hi, ok?"
22846,Alaric, Do you know how hard it is to fall asleep when that's what you're supposed to do?
22847,Stefan," Well, look, I know it's not easy, so...Damon suggested I bring something to... Help speed up the process"
22848,Alaric, What the hell
22849,Alaric," You know, I'll feel decidedly less pathetic if I don't drink alone"
22850,Stefan," Oh, I'm, uh, one step ahead of you"
22851,Alaric," So...ahem. Road trip, huh?"
22852,Stefan," Mmm. Yeah, yeah, I needed to stay here"
22853,Alaric," Why? I mean, why you? You know, it doesn't take much to baby-sit me while I sit here waiting for a psychotic break"
22854,Stefan," Well, unfortunately, we only have a limited amount of time"
22855,Alaric, Before what?
22856,Stefan, Before we have to resort to other methods
22857,Alaric, So you're worried you're going to have to torture it out of me. And you don't think Damon could have done that?
22858,Stefan," Look, Elena needed to go on that road trip with Damon. No matter what I go through... To get her back... fighting my bl*od lust, trying to gain control of my life again... None of that matters if she has feelings for somebody else"
22859,Elena, There he is
22860,Jeremy," Next time we compel him, remind me to make him better at baseball"
22861,Elena," Hey, Jer"
22862,Jeremy, Elena?
22863,Jeremy, What's wrong?
22864,Damon," Katherine sired us, Rose sired Katherine, all we need to do is find out who sired Rose"
22865,Jeremy, So you traveled across the country to get me to talk to a dead vampire?
22866,Damon," Dead vampire's redundant, but yes"
22867,Jeremy," Well, I can't. I can talk to Anna and Vickie because I knew them. I've never even met Rose"
22868,Damon, What good is you dying and coming back to life if you can't talk to a ghost when I need you to?
22869,Elena," Rose spent a long time running from Klaus as well. She and Damon were close, so maybe we can use you as a connection"
22870,Jeremy," Fine, fine. Can we do this later? My friend just got here. And yes, Damon, I actually have some. I'll call you when I'm done"
22871,Elena, Jer...
22872,Elena," Damon, it's Kol!"
22873,Jeremy, What the hell are you doing?!
22874,Elena," Jeremy, get back, he's an original!"
22875,Jeremy, What?!
22876,Kol," No hard feelings, mate, but we're not buds"
22877,Kol," You know, I'll never get used to aluminum but, hey, at least it won't break"
22878,Jeremy, Did you k*ll him?
22879,Damon," No, but it'll give us a head start. Come on"
22880,Damon," For the record, she's the one who wanted to stop in a motel, not me"
22881,Jeremy, So where are we?
22882,Damon, Corner of somewhere and nowhere where Kol can't find us
22883,Jeremy, I can't believe Kol was a vampire
22884,Damon," Well, didn't you find it weird that you made a friend so fast? Have you met you?"
22885,Elena, Not helping
22886,Elena," This should work. Right, Jer?"
22887,Jeremy, Yeah. It doesn't really matter
22888,Damon," All right, Whoopi. What do you need, candles, incense, pottery wheel?"
22889,Jeremy, That's not how it works
22890,Damon," I know, I know. They push from the other side and you pull from this one"
22891,Jeremy," All right, you, uh, you got a picture of her?"
22892,Damon," Picture? From what, our trip to Disneyland? Come on, Rose, you're not going to actually make us wait, are you? I know you're obsessed with me"
22893,Jeremy," All right, uh, tell me something about her"
22894,Damon," Um, well, she did this little thing with her tongue"
22895,Elena," Something that matters, Damon"
22896,Damon," She spent her last day in paradise. Soaking in the sun and reminiscing about what it means to be human. And when death came, she didn't fear it"
22897,Elena," I was with her on her last day, and she definitely wasn't in paradise"
22898,Jeremy, It was in the dream he gave her. She's here
22899,Caroline, Hi
22900,Tyler, You have no idea how much I've missed you
22901,Matt, Here we are. Home sweet home
22902,Rebekah," Ok, spill. Why are you being nice to me?"
22903,Matt, I drove you home. You don't have a car
22904,Rebekah, Not just that. I mean... helping me with the dance and standing up to Caroline. I don't buy it
22905,Matt, Buy what?
22906,Rebekah, The whole gentlemanly thing. After everything my family's done to you. What are you up to?
22907,Matt, It's sad that you can't just get a ride home from school without thinking there's some ulterior motive
22908,Rebekah, You're right. But I'm probably going to organize the whole dance and then have to compel myself a date
22909,Matt," Let's not get crazy. Good-bye, Rebekah"
22910,Rebekah," Good-bye, Matt. Thanks for the ride home"
22911,Rebekah, Mother...
22912,Rebekah, Give me one good reason why I shouldn't k*ll you right now
22913,Esther, Because I'm dying
22914,Elena, Is she lonely on the other side?
22915,Rose, No. I enjoy it. I was running so much when I was alive. Now I have the freedom to do whatever I want
22916,Jeremy," She says not to worry, she's happy"
22917,Damon, Is she still hot?
22918,Rose," Tell him he's still dripping with sex, too"
22919,Rose, Fine. Tell him I miss him
22920,Jeremy, She misses you
22921,Rose, And tell him that I'm rooting for him and Elena
22922,Jeremy," She, uh, she misses both of you"
22923,Rose, Unfortunately I don't have any news on the siring front. Klaus didn't sire me. No original did. It was Mary Porter
22924,Jeremy, She was sired by someone named Mary Porter
22925,Damon," Ahh, scary Mary. Well, where is she, Rose?"
22926,Rose," I didn't keep track of her when I was alive, much less now. Tell them to sit tight. Relax. I'll see what I can find out"
22927,Alaric, You think they got Jeremy by now?
22928,Stefan, They should. I haven't heard from them. Elena's worried about him. Now that she can't count on his ring anymore.
22929,Alaric," Who knows. Maybe his alter ego's a pot-smoking, hippie pacifist"
22930,Stefan," Yeah, maybe"
22931,Alaric, I can't say I thought mine would be so hostile and militant
22932,Stefan," Actually, it makes perfect sense. Your wife left you to become a vampire and your girlfriend was k*ll by one"
22933,Alaric, He must really hate me. He must really hate me. the failed hunter-slash- drinking buddy of vampires
22934,Stefan, Ah. He's too judgmental
22935,Alaric," The thing is... he's me. I'm not compelled, I'm not possessed. There's no humanity switch. What drives him... is me"
22936,Stefan," No. No, he's not you. He's the darkest parts of you. Parts we all have"
22937,Klaus," Well, this is depressing, isn't it?"
22938,Klaus," Oh, and I found this upstairs. Now by my count, there should be one more"
22939,Stefan," Yeah, well, it's going to take a little more time"
22940,Klaus," Why, because we're waiting for that one to pass out?"
22941,Klaus," No, thanks. I think I'll just k*ll him"
22942,Stefan," Well, then you won't know the location of the other stake"
22943,Klaus, I can live with that
22944,Stefan," Well, I can't. When we staked Finn, we discovered that k*ll an original vampire k*ll its entire bloodline. Now, I don't know which one of you I'm descended from, but I'd really rather not find out by dying, so why don't we just find the stake, destroy it so we can all be safe?"
22945,Klaus," So the fate of the entire vampire race depends on you finding the stake. And to get it, we need you to pass out"
22946,Klaus, Which means that I feel totally justified doing this
22947,Klaus, There. Sleeping like a baby
22948,Damon, There you are. Any sign of Evilaric?
22949,Stefan, Nope. Only dead Alaric
22950,Damon, What?
22951,Stefan," Don't worry, he was wearing his ring. Klaus was here. Let's just say he's not very patient"
22952,Damon, Kol must have told him we were in Denver. How long has Ric been out?
22953,Stefan," A few hours. I'm hoping when he wakes up, it won't be him. It'll be the other him"
22954,Damon, And if not?
22955,Stefan," Yeah, I know. Whatever it takes. So were you able to contact Rose?"
22956,Damon, Yeah. No answers yet. So we're just stuck in this motel until she gets back to us
22957,Stefan, A motel?
22958,Damon," Yeah, we had to get away from Kol. I'll call you when I know more"
22959,Jeremy, So what's up with you and Damon?
22960,Elena, What do you mean? Nothing's up
22961,Jeremy, You sure about that? 'Cause even Rose said something
22962,Elena, What...what did she say?
22963,Damon, Everything ok in here?
22964,Elena, Yeah. It's fine
22965,Damon," Ok. Well, I'm going to freshen up. You might want to get some rest. I'm sure Rose will make herself known when she gets back"
22966,Rebekah, How are you dying? I thought Ayana had preserved your body with a spell
22967,Esther," She did. I'm drawing my power from the Bennett witch line. When Abby died, the connection was severed. So my body is weakened"
22968,Rebekah," Well, if you've come to spend your last moments with your loving daughter, prepare to be disappointed. You should have spent last time plotting my death"
22969,Esther, Is that what you think I've been doing on the other side? I've been looking over you for a thousand years of joy and heartbreak. Your fights with Klaus. The nights you cried yourself to sleep calling out my name. Not a day has gone by that I wasn't right there with you
22970,Rebekah, And yet you still tried to k*ll me
22971,Esther," Because it shouldn't have been a thousand years, Rebekah. No one should live that long"
22972,Rebekah, But I haven't lived at all
22973,Esther," I'm sorry Rebekah. I'm so, so sorry"
22974,Klaus, What's going on?
22975,Rebekah, She's dead
22976,Tyler, Did I mention I miss you? Bad
22977,Caroline," Mmm, at some point, we are going to do this on an actual bed, right?"
22978,Tyler, Yes. I promise. Once I figure out how to deal with Klaus
22979,Caroline, Tell him to suck it. Broke his sire bond. And you won't have to deal with him anymore
22980,Tyler," It's easier said than done. Besides, I won't know if it's broken for sure until I test it"
22981,Caroline," Wait, I thought that's why you were coming back. Because you said you felt different"
22982,Tyler," I do feel different. I feel freer. Way more myself. All I know is, I just turned about a hundred times in the Appalachian Mountains. If I can get through that, I can get through anything"
22983,Caroline, Good. Because Klaus might not be our only problem
22984,Tyler, Why? What else did I miss?
22985,Caroline," Matt k*ll an original. And then, every vampire that original had ever turned mysteriously died. Right now Damon is desperate to figure out which original created our vampire bl*od line. And...if he finds out it wasn't Klaus, they're all going to k*ll him"
22986,Tyler, But Klaus turned me. So if he dies...I die
22987,Caroline, I know that. They know that. Difference is... Damon doesn't care
22988,Elena, You never told me about that. What you did for Rose
22989,Damon, It wasn't about you
22990,Elena, Why you don't let people see the good in you?
22991,Damon," Because when people see good, they expect good. And I don't want to have to live up to anyone's expectations"
22992,Elena, Don't
22993,Damon," Why not, Elena?"
22994,Jeremy, Elena?
22995,Elena," Oh, my God. Jeremy"
22996,Jeremy, Rose found Mary. She lives in Kansas
22997,Damon," Ok, then. Let's go"
22998,Stefan, Welcome back
22999,Alaric," What happened? Did I, uh..."
23000,Stefan," No. No, you pretty much, uh, laid there dead for half the night. But on the, uh, on the plus side... I did almost finish reading ""Moby Dick"""
23001,Alaric," This is stupid. Evil me, or whatever you want to call him, he's not going to make an appearance. Why would he? I mean, the best hiding place is the one where you can't find the person who hid it"
23002,Stefan, I know
23003,Alaric, So how do you want to do this?
23004,Stefan, I don't want to do any of this
23005,Alaric," Well, that makes two of us. But I don't think we have much choice in the matter"
23006,Stefan," Wait a minute, what are you doing? You need that ring"
23007,Alaric," No, what I need is hope that my alter ego doesn't have a death wish. So I'm taking bets that my dark side has a sense of self-preservation So let's see if he defends himself against death"
23008,Stefan," Look, Alaric, I'm not going to k*ll you, ok?"
23009,Alaric," If we have any chance at this, Stefan, you're going to have to try"
23010,Jeremy, This is the address
23011,Damon, Looks about right
23012,Elena, Wait here
23013,Jeremy, Why? So you guys can make out some more?
23014,Damon, Don't be a dick.Listen to your sister
23015,Damon, Thank you. Come on
23016,Damon," Whoa. Like ""Vampire Hoarders"""
23017,Elena, Who is this Mary person?
23018,Damon," Scary Mary. Really old, super creepy"
23019,Elena, And how do you know her?
23020,Damon, You know
23021,Elena, Of course
23022,Damon," What? I said creepy, not ugly"
23023,Damon, Mary...
23024,Kol, Quite contrary
23025,Alaric, You're not putting enough into this
23026,Stefan," If i put any more into it, I'm going to break your spine"
23027,Alaric," Well, don't back down now"
23028,Alaric," Well, don't back down now"
23029,Stefan," Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't. The bl*od"
23030,Alaric," Oh, come on, you're past that"
23031,Stefan," No, I'm not"
23032,Alaric," Then use it. Give into it. Try to k*ll me, Stefan, come on"
23033,Stefan," Not like this, Alaric"
23034,Alaric, Yes! Like this. You're going to have to want to k*ll me for me to believe that you will
23035,Stefan," I go this far, I may not be able to stop"
23036,Alaric," You want the answers from my darkest side, you're going to have to tap into yours. So don't back down. Don't fight it. Just do it!"
23037,Alaric," You're so weak. Look at you. One of nature's most hideous creatures, and you can't even get that right"
23038,Stefan, You
23039,Alaric, Me
23040,Kol, Shame about Mary. She used to be a blast. I don't quite know what happened. I fear all the time she spent with my family might have ruined her. She was a bit of an original groupie
23041,Elena, And were you her favorite?
23042,Kol," You mean, did I turn her. I think I did. But, no, wait. Maybe it was Rebekah. But there was also a Klaus period. And let's not forget the Elijah affair. I spoke to my brother. I know you're trying to find out who you descended from. Now you never will. So... Where did we leave off?"
23043,Damon," Elena, get out of here!"
23044,Kol," According to my brother, you're off-limits. Please don't test me"
23045,Damon, Don't touch her
23046,Kol," Oh, dear. I've hit the nerve. Relax, darling. I just want us to be even. You snapped my neck, you k*ll my brother, and then you humiliated me"
23047,Kol, There. Now we're even
23048,Stefan, Where's the stake?
23049,Alaric, You're worse than I ever was. Spineless. Pathetic
23050,Stefan, Tell me where the stake is before I k*ll you
23051,Alaric," You know, you're all going to burn. Ashes to dust"
23052,Stefan, Where's the stake?!
23053,Stefan, I'm going to k*ll you in 3... 2...1
23054,Alaric, It's in the cave. Where no vampire can get it
23055,Klaus," That wasn't too hard, was it?"
23056,Elena, Are you ok?
23057,Damon, Yeah
23058,Damon, That's better
23059,Damon, Are you ok? You're bleeding
23060,Elena, Yeah. I'll be fine
23061,Damon, What are you doing?
23062,Elena, What do you mean?
23063,Damon," Well, going on this trip and kissing me... What the hell is this?"
23064,Elena, Stefan thinks that I have feelings for you
23065,Damon, Oh. Do you?
23066,Elena, I don't...I don't...I don't know
23067,Damon," Hmm. I guess you thought this little trip could help you figure that out, didn't you?"
23068,Elena, No
23069,Damon," Or maybe you're hoping I'll screw it up so I can just make the decision for you, am I wrong?"
23070,Elena, Damon...
23071,Damon, Am I wrong?
23072,Elena," It's what you do, Damon! You sabotage things. You... I mean, think about it. Every time that there's a bump in the road, you lash out"
23073,Damon, But what if I didn't? What if there was no bump?
23074,Damon," I'm sorry, Elena. But this time I'm not going to make it so easy for you. This time you'll have to figure it out for yourself"
23075,Klaus," It's a little gratuitous, don't you think, Stefan? I would have been more gentle"
23076,Rebekah, I'm going to take him to the caves
23077,Rebekah," You're going to go inside and fetch me the stake And if you think you can hide, you're wrong"
23078,Klaus, And then there was one. I know about your brother's little mission to Denver. He failed. Not that that's news anymore
23079,Stefan," So what are you going to do now, Klaus? Are you going to k*ll me?"
23080,Klaus, I haven't actually decided yet
23081,Stefan," Oh, sure you have. See, you've had every chance and every excuse imaginable to do it, but yet you haven't. Which means you don't want to"
23082,Klaus," You know something, you're right. See, I'm still waiting for my old friend to come back. By the looks of it, he's just beneath the surface. Waiting to come out and play. Right, ripper?"
23083,Stefan," I've been fighting that part of myself. Thinking that if I repress it, it would go away. But it won't. And now that I've accepted it, it can't control me. And neither can you. So... unless you're going to stake me... why don't you get the hell out of my house"
23084,Rose," Are we there yet? Don't tell them I'm here. They had a fight. I know you want to stop it. Protect her from it. But you're young. You don't see what I see. It's not just that she makes him a better person. She does, but... he changes her, too. Damon challenges her. Surprises her. He makes her question her life. Beliefs. Stefan is different. His love is pure. And he'll always be good for her. Damon is either the best thing for her, or the worst"
23085,Caroline, My mom said you can stay as long as you want
23086,Tyler, Did she say we could share the bed?
23087,Caroline, No. She said you can sleep on the couch. At least until we figure out what Damon and Stefan find out about Klaus
23088,Tyler, And if Klaus didn't create their line? And they try to k*ll him?
23089,Caroline, Tyler... I just got you back.
23090,Caroline, I'm not losing you again
23091,Tyler, Klaus drew this for you?
23092,Caroline, Huh?
23093,Tyler, That's...pretty creepy
23094,Caroline, Yeah. Klaus is pretty creepy. Even when he's trying to be charming
23095,Tyler, Charming? Does Klaus have a thing for you or something?
23096,Caroline," No! As far as I'm concerned, he isn't capable of real feelings"
23097,Tyler, I'm serious. What the hell happened while I was gone?
23098,Caroline," Tyler. Nothing. Ok, nothing happened"
23099,Tyler, Then why'd you keep this?
23100,Caroline, I don't know
23101,Tyler, I think I'm going to find some place else to spend the night
23102,Caroline, Tyler... Tyler!
23103,Rebekah, Go get it. You know I can't get in
23104,Alaric, Why would I give you the one thing that requires everyone to keep me alive?
23105,Rebekah, Are we bargaining now? Fine. What's your offer?
23106,Alaric, There's only one stake out there. Which means only one original has to die. Help me. And I'll make sure it's not you
23107,Rebekah," Tenuous, but points for effort. You see, I don't want one original to die."
23108,Rebekah, I want them all to die
23109,Alaric, How the hell did you do that?
23110,Rebekah," It was easy to fool Niklaus, but I thought you, of all people, would understand. After all, my son did use your body at one point"
23111,Alaric, You're not Rebekah
23112,Rebekah, No. My name is Esther. And we have a great deal in common
23113,Klaus, What took you so long?
23114,Rebekah, Alaric didn't want to hand over the stake. Luckily I'm quite the charmer
23115,Klaus, That's it?
23116,Rebekah," Last of the white oak stakes that can k*ll us. Do you want to do the honors, or shall I?"
23117,Rebekah," Well, that's that, then"
23118,Klaus, Pack your bags. We're leaving
23119,Rebekah, Today?
23120,Klaus, Why not? There's nothing keeping us here. We'll grab the doppelganger and be off by sunset
23121,Rebekah, But tonight's the decade dance
23122,Klaus, So?
23123,Rebekah, So I'm head of the committee. We have to go
23124,Klaus, I'm not going to any dance
23125,Rebekah, Caroline will be there
23126,Klaus, That means nothing to me
23127,Rebekah, Please? I have big plans for tonight. Just go for me
23128,Klaus," Ok, fine. One last hurrah"
23129,Rebekah," One last hurrah, Nik"
23130,Damon, Where have you been? I've been calling you all day
23131,Alaric," Yeah, sorry about that. I just needed to get my head together"
23132,Damon, So I take it Rebekah got the stake
23133,Alaric, I don't know. I woke up alone. There's no sign of it
23134,Damon, Lovely. What now?
23135,Alaric," Well, I think I need to get out of town, You know, somewhere secluded. I keep blacking out, which means I'm still a threat to everyone"
23136,Damon," I don't know if right now is the best time for you to be going on a spirit quest, Ric"
23137,Alaric," Ah, it's just for a couple days. I'm stocked up on Bonnie's herb, so I should be fine. I got to go"
23138,Rebekah/Esther, Quite the cunning liar
23139,Alaric," Well, Damon's too arrogant to think his only friend would betray him"
23140,Rebekah/Esther," Just as Niklaus would blindly accept an invitation from his beloved sister, unaware that he is headed to his own death"
23141,Alaric, Did you give him the stake?
23142,Rebekah/Esther, He b*rned it without hesitation
23143,Alaric, So where is the real one?
23144,Rebekah/Esther, You'll get it when it can no longer be used against me in this body
23145,Alaric, So how do you...
23146,Rebekah/Esther, How do I return to my true form? With a little magic and some help from a vampire hunter
23147,Caroline, So Alaric is trying to pull out something together? Why is that a bad thing?
23148,Elena, Just I wish there was something I could do
23149,Elena, Where do you want me to hang this thing?
23150,Caroline," You know what? If Rebekah wanted to hang this monstrosity, she should have shown up to do it herself"
23151,Caroline, Just no
23152,Caroline, What are you doing? You can't just hang them. They're supposed to trickle down
23153,Caroline, Look at them all bromancey
23154,Elena," Yeah, I asked Matt to help Jeremy readjust. He got him his old job back at the grill"
23155,Caroline, That was nice of him
23156,Elena, Mm-hmm. Jeremy's got a lot on his mind. The whole thing with Alaric has got him really stressed out
23157,Caroline, You sure it had nothing to do with witnessing you and Damon getting hot and heavy in a skeevy motel?
23158,Elena, I didn't tell you that so you could torture me with it
23159,Caroline," Ah, what are friends for? So who you bringing to the dance?"
23160,Elena," What do you mean? I thought you, Bonnie, and I were going as girl dates"
23161,Caroline, Bonnie has a date
23162,Elena, What?
23163,Caroline," Jamie called And wanted to see her, so she asked him. So here's a thought. Why don't you ask Stefan?"
23164,Elena, I... I can't ask him on a date. I just made out with his brother
23165,Caroline," All the more reason. Like, you're supposed to be figuring out what you want. That's what Stefan wanted you to do, right?"
23166,Elena," Yeah, but..."
23167,Caroline," But nothing. I've watched ""The Bachelor"". Ok, fair is fair. It is Stefan's turn"
23168,Elena," Yeah, and you're not biased or anything"
23169,Caroline," I'm sorry, but Stefan is your epic love. And I'm not going down without a fight"
23170,Stefan, Hey
23171,Elena, Hey. Do do you have a second?
23172,Stefan, Yeah. Everything all right?
23173,Elena," Yeah. Yeah, I just, um I wanted to, uh... Caroline and I were talking about going to the dance, and, um... Ok, look, I know where we're at, you and I, and I know it would be stupid to even think that we could go back to the way things were, but I'm going to the dance, and I'd like to go with you"
23174,Stefan, Um... I'd love that
23175,Elena," Ok, great. Bye"
23176,Damon," I'm thinking gardenia corsage. Wrist, obviously. You don't want to accidentally stab her in the chest with a pin. That could get messy"
23177,Stefan," Damon, I..."
23178,Meredith, Don't do that. It's not funny
23179,Damon," Oh, come on. It's a little funny"
23180,Meredith," What do you want, Damon?"
23181,Damon," I need medical advice for a friend, Alaric. You remember him, right? About 6'2"", tried to hack you into pieces"
23182,Meredith, How is he?Are those herbs that Bonnie made for him working?
23183,Damon, I don't know. Can they work if he doesn't take them?
23184,Damon, I found these in his loft untouched
23185,Alaric, Why are we here?
23186,Esther," Long ago on this spot, My son tore my heart from my chest. The violence of my death marked this ground for all time"
23187,Esther, I'll need your ring
23188,Alaric," Now, why would I give you the one thing that protects me from death?"
23189,Esther," I will give you all the protection you need. However, the stake will burn up in the body of its first v*ctim. If you are to k*ll all of my children, I will need to bind the protective magic in your ring to the stake, thus rendering the white oak indestructible"
23190,Esther, The ultimate w*apon... for the ultimate hunter
23191,Elena, Wow. You look very dapper
23192,Stefan," You look, uh... very beautiful. Here. I, uh... I got something for you"
23193,Elena, Thank you
23194,Stefan, So given our dangerous dance karma... You sure you're up for this?
23195,Elena," Getting out of bed is dangerous these days, but we have to live our lives"
23196,Stefan, Who gave you that horrible advice?
23197,Elena, Some guy I used to date said it once or twice
23198,Stefan, Right
23199,Elena, Shall we?
23200,Stefan, Please
23201,Caroline, Have I told you how amazingly awesome you are?
23202,Matt," Yeah, I am one of the good ones. I know. Why the compliments? What else do you want?"
23203,Caroline, I know that you and Elena have been getting closer lately
23204,Matt, And your point is?
23205,Caroline," One way or the other, she's pretty much spoken for"
23206,Matt," Elena's my friend, Caroline. I'm just looking out for her"
23207,Caroline," And I'm just looking out for you, because sometimes the people who love her get caught in the crossfire"
23208,Matt, What's he doing here?
23209,Caroline, Are you crazy? If Klaus sees you...
23210,Tyler, What's he gonna do? Draw you another picture?
23211,Caroline," Tyler, this isn't a joke"
23212,Tyler, I could pretend I'm sired if I have to. But I'm not gonna hide while he's macking all over you
23213,Caroline, Tyler... You do not need to be jealous of Klaus
23214,Tyler," I am jealous, But I'm also competitive, So hang on. I'm about to sweep you off your feet"
23215,Elena, Teach me some moves
23216,Stefan," Oh, no, no, no, no. I, uh... I blacked out for most of this decade, remember?"
23217,Elena, Nice try
23218,Stefan, Bonnie seems happy
23219,Elena, She's working on it
23220,Stefan," I've been meaning to talk to her, apologize"
23221,Elena," Yeah, you should. Although I wouldn't expect her to forgive you or Damon. Listen, Stefan, about Damon, We should probably talk about the trip to Denver"
23222,Stefan," I don't need to know, Elena. When all this is over, if you and I find our way back to each other, You can tell me if you want to. Otherwise, I don't need to know. I don't want to know"
23223,Elena, How can you be so fair about this?
23224,Stefan, Because after everything I've put you through... I'm just honored to be your date tonight
23225,Damon, We three need to talk
23226,Jeremy, Sorry. Uh. Hey. Bonnie
23227,Bonnie, Why are you still wearing your ring? Didn't Elena tell you?
23228,Jeremy," Yeah, yeah, I know all about Alaric. When my sister stops hanging out with vampires, I'll take it off"
23229,Jamie," Uh, ex-boyfriend?"
23230,Bonnie, Yep
23231,Jamie, That's not awkward at all
23232,Elena," If Alaric's sick, then we need to find a cure, something"
23233,Damon, We tried medicine. We tried magic
23234,Stefan," Why don't we get him off vervain, compel him?"
23235,Damon," To do what, pretend to be Alaric? The guy that we know is gone. We're talking about someone who not only hates vampires, but vampire sympathizers, which makes one of his most obvious targets I don't know you, you?"
23236,Stefan, What? You think he'd go after Elena?
23237,Elena, So wait. What are you suggesting we do?
23238,Damon, I'm suggesting that we put him out of his misery
23239,Elena, What?
23240,Jeremy, No way in hell
23241,Damon," Oh, come on. It's what he would want. It's a mercy k*ll"
23242,Jeremy, You are out of your mind
23243,Elena, Jeremy
23244,Elena," Jer, stop!"
23245,Jeremy," This is Alaric we're talking about. You know, he looked out for us, And we need to do the same for him"
23246,Elena, No one's gonna hurt him
23247,Elena, Hey. Hey. Look at me. I promise
23248,Esther, Elena
23249,Esther," If you wish to help your friend Alaric, I suggest you come with me"
23250,Elena," Jeremy, go inside and get Stefan and Damon now"
23251,Esther," I mean you no harm, but willingly or not, You will come"
23252,Stefan, Salt. It's the binding agent for a spell
23253,Damon, We're trapped here
23254,Bonnie, You had all kinds of moves out there
23255,Jamie," Yeah? I mean, I was just, you know, Trying to make a good impression"
23256,Bonnie," Well, consider me impressed"
23257,Jamie, Your friends seem pretty cool
23258,Bonnie, Yeah. They're the most important thing in the world to me
23259,Jamie," Though you gotta admit, This whole circle of people, it's kind of crazy. I mean, there's vampires, werewolves, Ex-boyfriends with magic rings. I mean... I'm just a normal guy"
23260,Bonnie, A normal guy wouldn't have said yes to a date with me
23261,Jamie," Yeah, that's true"
23262,Damon, Sorry to spoil your 7 minutes in heaven. We have a problem
23263,Esther," You'll forgive me for taking you from the dance this evening. That's the burden of being the doppelganger, I'm afraid your bl*od is a potent binding agent for a witch's spell."
23264,Elena, Just please don't hurt Alaric
23265,Alaric, She's not hurting me
23266,Elena, Ric. What's going on? What are you doing with him?
23267,Esther, I'm going to remake him
23268,Elena, Remake him?
23269,Esther," Make him strong, fast, Like my children, Indestructible. For one final time, I'm going to tap into the dark magic I used a thousand years ago. Like my husband Mikael before him, I will make Alaric into a true hunter, the vampire to end all vampires"
23270,Elena, You can't create another original. What if he turns out to be an even bigger monster than your children?
23271,Esther," He won't, Now that he's embraced his darkest aspect his hatred for them will become more pure and uncompromising. In death, that hatred will be magnified"
23272,Elena, You don't know that. You don't know anything about him
23273,Esther," That is where you're wrong. Each time he died with that ring, during his brief journey into death, I was there on the other side. I spoke to him. I nurtured him, knowing that every death brought him closer to his true self. Vampires took everything from him. Now he's getting his vengeance."
23274,Caroline, What is it?
23275,Klaus," Where have you been, mate?"
23276,Tyler, I just got back in town
23277,Klaus," That's funny. I don't recall giving you permission to leave in the first place. You don't mind if I cut in, do you?"
23278,Caroline," Yes, actually, we do"
23279,Tyler, No. It's fine
23280,Caroline, Why do you always have to prove you're the alpha male?
23281,Klaus," I don't have to prove anything, love. I am the alpha male. Come on. One Dance. I won't bite"
23282,Klaus," You would have loved the 1920s, Caroline. Girls were reckless, sexy, fun. They literally used to dance until they dropped"
23283,Caroline, Heh. I don't suppose that ever happened to their dance partners
23284,Klaus," You should be nicer to me. I'm leaving town tomorrow. I'd invite you to come with me, but we both know you're not ready to accept my offer. Perhaps one day, in a year or even a century, You'll show up at my door and let me show you what the world has to offer."
23285,Klaus," You mark my words. Small-town boy, small-town life, it won't be enough for you"
23286,Klaus," Rebekah, call me back immediately. I only came to this ridiculous dance because you begged me to, and now you're nowhere to be found"
23287,Klaus, What is this?
23288,Stefan, Your mother's back
23289,Jamie," She does this all the time, right?"
23290,Klaus, What's taking so long? All boundary spells have a loophole
23291,Matt," People are walking right out of the dance, past the barrier"
23292,Jeremy," Well, if Matt and I can leave, we could stop Esther ourselves. We just gotta find out where she is"
23293,Stefan," su1c1de, Jeremy"
23294,Klaus," su1c1de would be disappointing me. Now work your magic, witch, or I'll start k*ll people you fancy"
23295,Bonnie, Let him go
23296,Klaus, Not until you get us out of here
23297,Stefan," Ah, don't be stupid, Klaus. Bonnie doesn't give a damn about us. The only reason she's helping right now is to save Caroline and Tyler. If you start k*ll the people she cares about, she'll tell us all to go to hell"
23298,Elena," Ric, this isn't what you want. It's not who you are"
23299,Alaric," You don't know who I am, Elena. You only know the weakest parts of me, a man who lost his way, befriending vampires instead of k*ll them"
23300,Elena, You don't mean that
23301,Alaric," They're all monsters. The bl*od of their v*ctim is on my hands, Jenna's bl*od is on my hands"
23302,Esther, When you are ready
23303,Elena," No, Ric, please don't. Don't do this"
23304,Elena, I won't help you. I'm not gonna give you my bl*od. You're gonna have to k*ll me
23305,Esther, That won't be necessary
23306,Esther, Drink and let it be done
23307,Elena," No, Ric, please don't"
23308,Elena, no
23309,Alaric, Is it finished?
23310,Esther, Not just yet
23311,Damon, Here. Jeremy made a little gilbert bl*od donation for your locater spell
23312,Bonnie, I have to do this with you two lurking over me?
23313,Damon, You're still mad at me for what happened to Abby. Let me apologize. I'm sorry Elijah forced us to turn your mother into a vampire to save Elena's life. Didn't exactly have a choice
23314,Bonnie," There's always a choice. Whenever you make one, someone else suffers"
23315,Klaus," Let's cut the dramatics and begin, shall we?"
23316,Bonnie, Esther's fighting me
23317,Klaus," Esther couldn't possibly have this much power. No, she's channeling something."
23318,Bonnie, A hotspot
23319,Klaus, Get the humans ready. I know where she is
23320,Stefan, They're at the old cemetery. Jeremy and Matt are headed there right now
23321,Caroline, You let them go? They're gonna get themselves k*ll
23322,Stefan," We didn't have a choice, Caroline. We're useless right now stuck in here"
23323,Caroline," Hey, she'll be fine. Elena always manages to find her way through this stuff"
23324,Stefan," Yeah, well, I'm just as worried about what Esther's up to. She led Klaus here for a reason. If she succeeds in whatever she's doing…"
23325,Tyler, Klaus could get k*ll...And I die along with him
23326,Stefan," No one's gonna die, ok? Bonnie's still looking for a way around the boundary spell. It's not too late"
23327,Caroline," So best-case scenario, Bonnie gets us out of here, Klaus hauls ass to Timbuktu, And you and i, we're home free"
23328,Tyler, Or we let Esther come and k*ll him
23329,Caroline, That's not a best-case scenario. That's not even a remotely acceptable scenario
23330,Tyler, It would be an option if we knew he wasn't the one who turned your bloodline. You'd be safe. At least he'd be gone
23331,Caroline, How could you say that?
23332,Tyler, Because I'm angry. Because I hate him. I should have never let him dance with you
23333,Caroline," What were you're supposed to do? He can't know that you're not sired anymore. Tyler, it doesn't matter How many times I dance with him. I love you"
23334,Esther," He'll wake soon. When he does, he may for a time be his old self. If so, you can say your good-byes before his transition is complete"
23335,Elena," You said you wanted to undo the evil that you created, but this this is just as evil"
23336,Esther," Alaric will never be what my children became. I have granted him enough power to complete his task. Then when the time is right, he will die"
23337,Elena," How, if he's immortal?"
23338,Esther," All you need to know is that when this is over, we will have rid the earth of vampires once and for all"
23339,Elena," Yeah, but you'll be k*ll the good along with the bad. You're no better than Klaus"
23340,Esther," Am I not? I desire a world where you and your loved ones will not suffer at the hands of vampires, like your aunt Jenna did"
23341,Elena, Don't you dare use Jenna as an excuse for what you've done
23342,Esther," You may draw comfort knowing that your aunt is not in the place that I was. She doesn't know the torment of the other side. Though made a vampire, she remained pure, and she knows peace... which is all any of us can hope for"
23343,Matt, Don't move
23344,Jeremy, Where is Elena?
23345,Elena, Jeremy?!
23346,Jeremy, Let her go
23347,Esther, How foolish of you to risk your lives in defense of those who will k*ll you. But if that is your choice...
23348,Jeremy," Matt. Matt, drop your g*n!"
23349,Matt, I can't. I'm not controlling it
23350,Elena," Esther, stop it!"
23351,Alaric, Oh god. Where's my ring? Tell me what happened
23352,Klaus," You know, this is your fault. You set us on this path when you released my mother. I wonder if revenge will prove worth the cost"
23353,Stefan," As far as Esther, we've stopped her before, we'll stop her again"
23354,Klaus," We are strange bedfellows, you and I. You know, all of this reminds me of our time together in the twenties"
23355,Stefan, You say that like I'm supposed to have happy memories about it
23356,Klaus," Well, there were moments, real friendship, brotherhood"
23357,Damon," Oh, he already has a brother. Not to be, you know, territorial or anything"
23358,Klaus," Oh, no, of course. The Salvatore's and their unshakeable bond. I wonder what'll happen when Elena finally makes her choice. Will we see you shake just a little bit?"
23359,Bonnie, It's done. Esther's not fighting me anymore. The boundary spell is broken
23360,Stefan," Thank you, Bonnie. For everything"
23361,Bonnie, I didn't do it for you
23362,Jeremy," Damon's here, and Klaus took Esther's body"
23363,Alaric, Does he know about the stake?
23364,Jeremy," No, only that she tried to turn you into a w*apon and failed"
23365,Jeremy, What's going on?
23366,Alaric," Listen, Jeremy... I'm not gonna complete the transition. My dark side was dangerous enough as a human. I can't be a vampire"
23367,Jeremy," So, what, we're just gonna lock you in here and let you die?"
23368,Jeremy," No. No, we can't"
23369,Alaric," Listen, Jeremy, it's the right thing to do, ok? After everything that's happened, after... after all that I've done... maybe I had it coming"
23370,Elena," Hey, wait, Jer"
23371,Elena," Alaric, this isn't your fault"
23372,Alaric," Please, you guys, let's not make this any harder than it already is. You two should go. Damon's here. He'll make sure it'll all go down the right way"
23373,Alaric, Hey. Hey
23374,Jeremy, Don't. Just don't give me some crap speech about how I need to be the man of the house
23375,Alaric, Ok. I won't
23376,Elena," This is all my fault. You moved out. You... you gave me your ring back. You didn't want any part of this, And I I forced you to stay and take care of us"
23377,Alaric, Don't do that. Ok? Taking care of you and Jeremy has been... it's been the closest I've ever come to the life I always wanted
23378,Alaric, You should go
23379,(They go out. Everyone is gathered in front of the crypt," Meredith, Jeremy, Matt, Bonnie, Caroline, Tyler, Stefan, Elena and Damon. She looks at Alaric and then rejoins the others. They all look at him, they have tears in their eyes. He looks at them, looks moved and goes back inside.)"
23380,Klaus," Your trap failed, mother. I live, and I will go on living. let your beloved spirits try to preserve you again. I dare you to come after me. I will build an army so big, no one will ever touch me. My survival will haunt you through eternity. You will never destroy me!"
23381,Bonnie, Thanks for the ride home
23382,Jamie," No problem. You know there's nothing you could have done, right?"
23383,Bonnie, I know. That doesn't make it any easier.
23384,Jamie," I should have said this before, but... Thank you for protecting me"
23385,Bonnie, Apparently it's what I do
23386,Jamie, You really are pretty amazing
23387,Bonnie, Sometimes I think I'd settle for just ordinary
23388,Jamie," You said your dad's out of town, right? You gonna be ok by yourself?"
23389,Bonnie, No. I don't think I am
23390,Matt, Mr. Saltzman
23391,Jeremy, Alaric
23392,Stefan," We can handle this later, you know"
23393,Elena," No, I'd rather get it over with now before some janitor comes to clean out Alaric's stuff and realizes the history teacher was a vampire slayer"
23394,Stefan," Elena... Hey, Elena, please"
23395,Elena," I can't, Stefan, ok? I... I can't think about the fact that Jeremy and I don't have anyone to take care of us anymore. Or... or that we've lost another friend. I just can't... I can't think about any of it"
23396,Stefan, I want you to come with me
23397,Elena, I'm not done
23398,Stefan, Please
23399,Stefan," We were in this gym the night Klaus compelled me to turn my feelings off. I thought I hit rock bottom in the twenties, but... after I bit you, I never wanted to feel anything again. But someone... kept telling me that it was ok to feel... No matter how much it hurt... That our emotions would make us human, good or bad, and to never lose hope"
23400,Elena, Who gave you that horrible advice?
23401,Stefan, Some girl I used to date
23402,Elena, I don't have anyone anymore
23403,Stefan, You have me
23404,Meredith, I gave him a sedative. He'll fall asleep first. He'll go comfortably
23405,Damon," Well... I offered to snap his neck, put him out of his misery, but... he didn't take me up on it"
23406,Meredith, You seem surprised
23407,Damon," Well, you just think a guy so used to dying wouldn't want to drag it out"
23408,Meredith," Well, it was nice of you to give him the option"
23409,Damon, Hmm. Apparently my choices have been a little controversial lately
23410,Meredith, You shouldn't leave him alone in there
23411,Damon, That's the way he wants it
23412,Meredith, Is that really what you think he wants?
23413,Damon," Aw, Ric"
23414,Alaric, Is this the part where you give me a dream? rainbows and rolling green hills?
23415,Damon, I was drunk when I told you that
23416,Alaric," Yeah, and I told you I'd use it against you"
23417,Damon, Damn you. Sorry I k*ll you. Twice
23418,Alaric, So I have to actually die to get a real apology out of you
23419,Damon, Drink?
23420,Alaric, Actually I've been thinking about cutting back
23421,Damon, Yeah. This stuff'll k*ll you
23422,Esther," Your sisters need you to finish what I started, Bonnie"
23423,Jamie, Bonnie. Hey. Hey
23424,Jamie, I think you're having a bad dream
23425,Damon," What are you doing here? Hey, Bonnie, What, are you sleepwalking or something? Bonnie?"
23426,Caroline, What do you mean you're ditching my clean up committee?
23427,Tyler, Klaus called. He's leaving town and wants me to pack up his house.
23428,Caroline," Well, since when does sire bond equal mover slave?"
23429,Tyler, Since he realized you're not gonna dump me for him.
23430,Caroline," Ugh, he's being petty."
23431,Tyler, And he still thinks I'm sired to him. It's fine. I'll keep up the act and it will all be
23432,Caroline," I love you, too."
23433,Caroline, Hello?
23434,Caroline, Where's Matt?
23435,Rebekah, He bailed. Got called into work at the last minute.
23436,Caroline," Are you kidding me? So, it's just us?"
23437,Rebekah," Yes, and you're late. Clean-up committee started at 8 o' clock."
23438,Caroline, It's like 8:02.
23439,Rebekah, Exactly. I managed to turn up on time and I didn't even get to attend the
23440,Caroline," I'm sorry about your Mom. I mean, I know you like hated her and"
23441,Rebekah, I'm sorry about your teacher. He seemed like a nice guy.
23442,Caroline," Yeah, he was."
23443,Rebekah, I'm gonna get started on the gym.
23444,Rebekah, You're supposed to be dead.
23445,Alaric, I am.
23446,Stefan," Going darker, huh?"
23447,Elena, It's the only color we had.
23448,Jeremy, That's what happens when you decide to paint your dead guardian's room in
23449,Stefan, I don't suppose anyone tried to talk you guys out of doing this so soon.
23450,Elena, We have to keep moving. Otherwise we'll start thinking and we don't wanna
23451,Stefan, You want a hand?
23452,Jeremy," So, are you two like back together or something?"
23453,Elena," What? No, Jer. We're just…"
23454,Stefan," I was just checking up on you guys, seeing how you were doing, after, after"
23455,Jeremy," We're fine. But, if you are trying to be the good guy again, why don't you do"
23456,Elena, He didn't mean that.
23457,Stefan," Yeah, yeah he did."
23458,Stefan, I'll get that.
23459,Damon, We have a problem.
23460,Rebekah, Alaric Saltzman just tried to k*ll me.
23461,Klaus, Alaric Saltzman is supposed to be dead.
23462,Rebekah," Well, he's not. And he's vampire thanks to mother's spell with a white oak"
23463,Klaus, Where is he now?
23464,Rebekah," He's stuck at the school without a daylight ring, but as soon as night falls"
23465,Klaus, Fine. I'll collect Elena. We'll be on our way.
23466,Rebekah, Forget Elena! You don't need anymore stupid hybrids.
23467,Klaus, What I need is protection from Esther's continued as*ault against us.
23468,Rebekah," We'll protect each other, like we always have. Always and forever, Nik."
23469,Klaus, I'm not leaving without her.
23470,Rebekah, I'm leaving now. You can either walk out that door with me or you are on
23471,Rebekah, Fine. Trust your hybrids over your family. Let your spite be the death of
23472,Rebekah," Move it, sire boy!"
23473,Tyler, What's her deal?
23474,Stefan, What do you mean he turned? I thought you were standing guard.
23475,Damon, Don't blame me. Blame Bonnie the bl*od bank. She fed him.
23476,Bonnie, I had no idea what was happening. Okay. The witches led me there. They
23477,Stefan," So, where's the stake now?"
23478,Damon," Oh, you mean the white oak one? The one that can k*ll an original and wipe"
23479,Bonnie," If you are so upset with me, why did you feed me your bl*od to save my life?"
23480,Damon," Because I do stupid things, Bonnie. I do things, like let my friend die with"
23481,Stefan, Alright. So how do we k*ll him now?
23482,Bonnie, I've been trying to figure that out. A witch can't truly make an immortal
23483,Damon," So, what's the witchy work around?"
23484,Bonnie, That's the problem. I don't know.
23485,Elena," Whoever this is, it's not funny."
23486,Alaric," Well, who else would it be?"
23487,Elena, Ric?
23488,Alaric," Listen, closely. I'm at the school, I have Caroline and if you wanna keep her"
23489,Jeremy, What the hell do you want?
23490,Klaus, Now is that any way to treat a guest?
23491,Stefan," What are you doing here, Klaus?"
23492,Klaus," Well, for starters, young Jeremy here could show some manners and invite me"
23493,Stefan, Why don't you go up to your room?
23494,Damon, Now.
23495,Stefan," Hmm, poor lad. Loses one questionable father figure only to be replaced by"
23496,Damon," Yeah, about that. Something happened."
23497,Klaus," Oh, I know all about my mother's invulnerable little creation. That's why I'm"
23498,Damon, Can't help you there.
23499,Stefan, Elena!
23500,Stefan, Where is she?
23501,Jeremy, I don't know. She was just here a few minutes ago.
23502,Damon, Where is she?
23503,Stefan, She is not here.
23504,Damon, What do you mean she's not here? Where did she go?
23505,Bonnie, What's going on?
23506,Damon, Klaus wants in. We have to keep him out.
23507,Alaric, Right on time.
23508,Elena," Caroline. Let her go, Alaric."
23509,Alaric, Free her yourself.
23510,Elena, You said that you would let her go.
23511,Alaric," How many times do I have to tell you, Elena? Stop trusting vampires!"
23512,Klaus, I think you're probably gonna want to let me in.
23513,Jeremy, Elena's car is gone.
23514,Bonnie, Why wouldn't she tell anyone where she was going?
23515,Stefan, Get down!
23516,Damon, Missed me.
23517,Damon, Missed me again.
23518,Stefan, Alaric.
23519,Stefan, Put it out.
23520,Klaus, Come outside and make me.
23521,Stefan, Elena is not here. Alaric has her and Caroline. He's gonna k*ll them both
23522,Klaus, Now I know you're not asking me to walk into a certain death.
23523,Stefan," I really wish we could. But unfortunately, if Alaric k*ll you there's a 1 in 4"
23524,Damon, I'll take those odds.
23525,Stefan, And a hundred percent chance that Tyler dies.
23526,Damon, I'm good with that too.
23527,Stefan, Why don't we just figure out a way to put Alaric down?
23528,Klaus," Okay. How about Damon sneaks in and distracts Alaric, while Stefan grabs"
23529,Damon," Huh, that's a great idea. What's to stop me from getting k*ll instantly?"
23530,Klaus, Nothing.
23531,Damon, Caroline is in there. Don't you have a thing for her? Or did she just reject you
23532,Stefan, This isn't really helping too much.
23533,Bonnie, I might have an idea. My mom used a desiccation spell on Michael that
23534,Klaus, If and might your words inspire such confidence.
23535,Bonnie," I'll get it. But even with the spell, we need a lot of vampire muscle to take"
23536,Klaus, Just so we're clear. The sun sets in about 8 hours. We don't succeed before
23537,Caroline," No. No more. Please, no more."
23538,Elena," Alaric, stop!"
23539,Alaric, Sit down! This keeps the vervain in her system. It's like inhaling razor blades
23540,Elena, Why are you doing this?
23541,Alaric, To make it easier on you when you put her out of her misery.
23542,Elena, What? No!
23543,Alaric," Isn't this what you wanted, Elena? For me to teach you how to k*ll a vampire?"
23544,Elena, This isn't what I want.
23545,Alaric," Of course it is. All those hours you spend training, getting stronger. You could"
23546,Damon," Well, this is promising."
23547,Bonnie," Relax, Abby will be here."
23548,Damon," I'm sorry, I forgot about her stellar track record in the dependability"
23549,Bonnie," Jamie said she was coming, okay. Just give her time."
23550,Damon, Don't get your hopes up! Might be a girl scout.
23551,Abby," Hello, Bonnie."
23552,Bonnie, Thanks for coming.
23553,Abby, Jamie's worried about you. He said it was urgent. I just didn't think you'd ever
23554,Bonnie," Like Jamie said, it's urgent."
23555,Stefan, Abby just showed up.
23556,Klaus," Good. Perhaps this plan won't be an epic failure after all. You know, if this"
23557,Stefan, I'll go with you.
23558,Klaus, Really? What's the catch?
23559,Stefan, There's no catch. I turned my back on everything here to make sure Elena's
23560,Klaus, And that is what makes you her better option. It's a shame it's not easier for
23561,Stefan," You know, all this time and energy you've spent trying to get me and my"
23562,Klaus (laughs)," Has it? Has it really? Well, then perhaps I should let Elena decide"
23563,Stefan, Go for it. Damon and I have been through a hell of a lot worse than you.
23564,Abby, Why didn't I have to be invited in?
23565,Bonnie, Only vampires live here.
23566,Damon, We signed over the deed to Elena. But she died and the seal broke and very
23567,Damon, bl*od?
23568,Damon," Oh, come on. Take it as a peace offering."
23569,Damon," Fine, more for me."
23570,Bonnie, We called you here because I need help with a spell. Esther created a
23571,Abby," Bonnie, it's too dangerous. Your magic comes from the earth. It's pure. This"
23572,Bonnie, You turned your back on me for 16 years. You have no idea what I can
23573,Damon," Gotta say, I'm team Bonnie on this one. How hard can it be to parch a"
23574,Abby, The spell allows you to stop a vampire's heart. The bl*od will stop flowing and
23575,Bonnie, That's exactly what we wanna do.
23576,Abby," To stop a vampire's heart, you need to find a balance among the living. Can"
23577,Damon," What? What does that mean? Bonnie, I don't speak witch."
23578,Bonnie, I have to stop a human heart.
23579,Bonnie, I just got this. It connects me to Caroline and Elena through our phones.
23580,Damon, Digital locater spell. Why the hell do we need you then?
23581,Damon, Hand it over.
23582,Jeremy, I'm not giving you my ring. Let me do this.
23583,Damon," By my math, you've already bit it once, possibly twice, wearing that thing"
23584,Jeremy, This is my ring. Elena is my sister. No one's gonna fight harder for her than
23585,Damon, Fine. Be stubborn.
23586,Damon," Try not to k*ll him, will you?"
23587,Klaus," Look at this, one big, happy family."
23588,Bonnie," Drink this. It's my bl*od. It bridges us all together, so that when I stop"
23589,Stefan," One of us gets a clean sh*t, take it, the other two hold him down."
23590,Klaus," Before we all walk through these doors, let's get on the same page, shall we? I was the one who created your vampire bl*od line, therefore I'm responsible for your lives and Tyler's life, Caroline's life and of course Abby's life, should anything go wrong."
23591,Damon, Or you're just lying to save your ass.
23592,Klaus," I'm not lying, but go head, call my bluff, let the teacher k*ll me. You'll all be dead soon thereafter."
23593,Stefan," Let's just get this over with, shall we?"
23594,Elena, Why are you doing this?
23595,Alaric, Because you need me. Because you're an 18 year old girl without parents or
23596,Elena, Look at you. How is this right?
23597,Alaric," She's a m*rder. She told me she k*ll someone and liked it. Now, how is"
23598,Elena, You don't know anything about them.
23599,Alaric, Why am I wrong? Do you actually think that they'd be proud of you?
23600,Alaric," If you don't side with the humans, you're just as bad as them."
23601,Alaric, Now k*ll her or I'll do it for you and I'll make it hurt. Get up!
23602,Alaric, I thought I taught you better than that.
23603,Elena, You did.
23604,Elena, Get help!
23605,Alaric, Not so fast.
23606,Klaus (whispers), Shhh. It's okay. It's okay. It's me. It's okay. You're safe. We'll save
23607,Klaus, Do you understand me?
23608,Caroline (nods), Thank you.
23609,Alaric," I should k*ll you. I should gut you like Brian Walters, Bill Forbes and all the"
23610,Elena, So then why am I still alive? There is obviously no humanity left in you. So
23611,Damon, Do it now!
23612,Bonnie, They made contact. It's happening.
23613,Jeremy, What's wrong?
23614,Bonnie, Something happened. The connection broke.
23615,Elena (holding a kn*fe to her throat), Stop! Let him go or I'll k*ll myself.
23616,Alaric," Put it down, Elena."
23617,Elena," Why, because you still need me alive? There's a reason why Esther used me to"
23618,Alaric, You're wrong.
23619,Elena, Am I?
23620,Alaric, Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
23621,Nurse," Be careful, moving only makes it hurt more."
23622,Elena, What are doing?
23623,Klaus, Draining you of all your bl*od.
23624,Tyler (surprised), Elena.
23625,Elena," Tyler, help me!"
23626,Klaus, He can't. He needs to go fetch me more empty bl*od bags. About three liters
23627,Elena," Tyler, please. Get Stefan, please."
23628,Klaus," No, Tyler, get the bags."
23629,Klaus, Forget the girl and get the bags. Now!
23630,Elena, So that's it? You're just gonna bleed me dry?
23631,Klaus," Yes, but don't worry. It'll be completely painless, as the last drop is drawn,"
23632,Damon, Why am I still alive?
23633,Alaric, Get up!
23634,Alaric," I said, get up! Klaus is gonna k*ll Elena."
23635,Damon, What?
23636,Stefan, What are you talking about? Klaus needs Elena's bl*od to make hybrids. She's
23637,Alaric," The witch bound my life to Elena's. If she dies, I die. Klaus figured that out and"
23638,Elena, What about your hybrids? You'll need more than this to create your army.
23639,Klaus," These last few liters will have to suffice. You see, by attempting to k*ll us, my"
23640,Elena," If you believe that, then why take my bl*od at all? You want a backup family."
23641,Klaus," You know, Stefan blames me for trying to tear him from his brother, but I think"
23642,Klaus," Consider this me doing you a favor. Once you're dead, you won't have to"
23643,Elena, Rot in hell.
23644,Klaus," You're welcome. Sweet dreams, Elena. It's been fun."
23645,Elena, What are you doing?
23646,Tyler, Shhh.
23647,Elena, Tyler.
23648,Klaus, So much for that sire bond.
23649,Tyler, I'm not your little bitch anymore.
23650,Klaus, How did you break the sire bond?
23651,Tyler, By breaking every bone in my body a hundred times for the girl I love.
23652,Klaus, That's impossible.
23653,Tyler, Is it? Or maybe real love is stronger than fake loyalty. But what would you
23654,Klaus, You know you should be thanking me. I gave you a gift. I took away your
23655,Tyler, You didn't give a crap about me! You just didn't want to be alone.
23656,Tyler, Come on.
23657,Klaus," Goodbye, Tyler."
23658,Damon," Hey, are you okay?"
23659,Bonnie, Oh my god! Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy!
23660,Stefan, We should get her home before the sun sets.
23661,Elena," You two are really gonna walk me all the way to the door, aren't you?"
23662,Stefan, You lost a lot of bl*od today.
23663,Elena," Yeah, I know, but I told you I'm fine. I just have a little headache."
23664,Damon," Yeah, but the sun's about to go down and Ric's gonna be able to terrorize"
23665,Elena," Yeah, but he can't hurt me. It's you two that we should be worrying about."
23666,Stefan," Nah, he won't be able to find us."
23667,Stefan, I'll call you when we get back.
23668,Elena, I know it's selfish. I know that it seems that I'm stringing you both along. But I
23669,Stefan, It's – It's been a long day.
23670,Damon," We'll call you from the road, after we've dumped Klaus' body in the Atlantic."
23671,Elena, Just be careful. Both of you.
23672,Elena, What are you guys doing here?
23673,Caroline, Welcome to our victory party!
23674,Elena, What victory? We've failed Alaric is still out there.
23675,Bonnie," We know, but we've been trying to get rid of Klaus forever and Caroline"
23676,Matt, I gotta be honest I'm a little pissed none of you let me help you
23677,Tyler," Yeah, he would‘ve taken you right down to the hospital, bro."
23678,Matt," Please, I'm more stealth than that, I'm like a ninja."
23679,Jeremy," Yeah, you wish."
23680,Caroline," Here, you need this. I heard. And you know that sooner or later, you're"
23681,Elena, I know.
23682,Tyler," Hey, give me your hand."
23683,Elena, Thank you for standing up to Klaus like that.
23684,Tyler," Let's just say, it's been a long time coming."
23685,Caroline," Way too long. Alright, let's drink!"
23686,Elena, I do not condone this by the way.
23687,Jeremy," You survived Klaus. Alright, make an exception. You can go back to being"
23688,Elena, Okay.
23689,Tyler, Hang on. Do you guys here that?
23690,Tyler, That is the sound of a Klaus free life.
23691,Elena," To a Klaus free life and to all of you, my family."
23692,Liz," Carol, what's so urgent you called an emergency council meeting"
23693,Carol," I didn't call the meeting, Liz. He did."
23694,Alaric, Join us sheriff. I was just telling the council about out vampire problem. Or
23695,Liz, What do you think you're doing?
23696,Alaric," Well, perhaps you and the mayor can enlighten the group on the strides"
23697,Carol, Why are doing this?
23698,Alaric, These women are hypocrites. They claim to spearhead our defense against the
23699,Liz, That's enough. We're done here. It's time to go.
23700,Alaric," Sit down, Liz! We're just getting started."
23701,Stefan, What?
23702,Damon, How many desiccated hybrids does it take to screw in a light bulb?
23703,Stefan, You're in a good mood.
23704,Damon," Yeah, I'm in a good mood. Klaus is dead, my brother is halfway sane, again."
23705,Stefan, We won.
23706,Damon, Once more with feeling.
23707,Stefan, We won.
23708,Damon, Thank you.
23709,Stefan," You know what, thank you. Turns out we make a pretty good team, huh?"
23710,Damon, It only took a century and a half.
23711,Stefan, What happens when Elena makes a decision?
23712,Damon," You know how these things pan out, Stefan. She'll probably make a list of"
23713,Stefan, What if she doesn't?
23714,Damon, Then she'll pick one of us.
23715,Stefan," Well, if she chooses you, I'll leave town and let you two be happy and not be"
23716,Damon," And in sixty years, we'll go back to being brothers and none of this will have"
23717,Stefan, Yeah.
23718,Damon," Fine, she chooses you, I'll leave town too. All this over one girl."
23719,Stefan, She's a pretty special girl.
23720,Damon," Yes, she is."
23721,Jeremy, Hey. Everyone gone?
23722,Elena, It's just us.
23723,Jeremy, I hate this room.
23724,Elena, Me too. Mom and Dad were right. Alaric should just k*ll all the vampires and
23725,Jeremy," You forget that Alaric never wanted any of this. Once he carries out his plans,"
23726,Jeremy," I'm gonna shower and get some sleep. Goodnight, Elena."
23727,Elena, Goodnight.
23728,Elena, Hey. Jeremy locked himself in the bathroom again. Does he think we don't know what he's doing in there?
23729,Jenna, He's 14. They don't think
23730,Jenna, Hey. You'll get me in trouble with your...
23731,Elena, Good morning mom
23732,Meredith," She's going to be fine. She got a little banged up today, hit her head. But it was just a slight concussion. Nothing to worry about"
23733,Jeremy," But she collapsed, there was bl*od"
23734,Meredith," Honestly, Jeremy, she's OK. She's just... She's been through a lot. Is there anyone"
23735,Damon, Did what?!
23736,Jeremy, I took her to the hospital. When you find your sister unconscious you call 911 
23737,Damon, Not when you have a parade of vampires at your disposal. 
23738,Stefan, Every remaining original is going to want Elena dead to stop Alaric. She's a sitting duck in there
23739,Jeremy," Well, Meredith wants to keep her here for observation"
23740,Damon," Jeremy, get Elena home. We're on our way"
23741,Damon, Have I told you lately how much I appreciate you not being the dumbest brother on earth?
23742,Stefan," You know one of us needs to keep moving, right? If Klaus really is the sire of our bloodline, we need to keep his body hidden before Alaric finds him, k*ll him and we all end up dead"
23743,Damon, Our life is one big proverbial coin toss
23744,Alaric," Hello, Meredith"
23745,Meredith, What are you doing here?
23746,Alaric, I'm Elena's guardian. I thought it was strange I didn't get a phone call
23747,Meredith, How did you find out?
23748,Alaric," Oh, I have eyes and ears everywhere now. It's funny. The people of this town are actually good at their jobs when you allow them to be. Speaking of..."
23749,Alaric, You are a little too good at your job
23750,Alaric, But that's because you cheat. So I found your stash of vampire bl*od
23751,Meredith, Don't... stop it. Don't... don't do that. Stop it!
23752,Alaric, The council will be in touch with the medical board to have your license suspended. Mayor Lockwood
23753,Caroline, Couch
23754,Elena, I'm fine. I just... I want something to eat first
23755,Tyler, We're on it. As soon as we make sure no one's lurking in the closets
23756,Caroline," All right, couch. Now"
23757,Elena," Ugh, I told you, I'm fine"
23758,Caroline," Doctor says rest, you rest"
23759,Caroline, Now what can I get you? Do you want some tea? Maybe some vodka? Both will help you sleep
23760,Caroline, I know. I'm being smothering. It's what I do
23761,Elena, No. It's... It's nice
23762,Caroline, I'm thinking... Maybe tea with vodka
23763,Elena, Caroline Forbes told me that my ponytail lacked juju
23764,Matt, I don't even know what that means
23765,Bonnie," It means Caroline's driving Elena crazy, as usual. So as I psychically predicted, flare jeans are"
23766,Elena," That doesn't make you are a psychic, Bonnie. It means that you watch too much ""top model"""
23767,Bonnie, Say what you want. But I've got a bad feeling about the bonfire tonight
23768,Elena," It doesn't matter, because I can't go"
23769,Elena," I know, but Jenna's in town and my parents want to do family night"
23770,Matt, You have to go. See if you can sneak out
23771,Matt, Got to see Coach Tanner. Love you
23772,Bonnie, You didn't say it back
23773,Elena, What?
23774,Bonnie," You know what. You can't string him along, Elena. If you're not into it anymore, just... Tell him"
23775,Elena, Where is everyone?
23776,Matt, Tyler and Caroline got a call from their moms. What were you dreaming about?
23777,Elena, Sophomore year
23778,Matt, That seems like forever ago
23779,Elena," It was. I'm sorry that I strung you along. I should have figured out what I wanted, and just been"
23780,Matt, Which one?
23781,Elena, Stefan
23782,Stefan, Are you okay?
23783,Elena, Yeah
23784,Jeremy," Thanks, man. Tell the kitchen I appreciate them staying open for me"
23785,Alaric, We need at talk
23786,Elena, I'm being over-coddled. I feel completely fine
23787,Stefan, You're on house arrest. You're supposed to be coddled
23788,Matt, Wouldn't it be smarter if we just got you the hell out of town?
23789,Elena, And do what? Go on the run for
23790,Elena, I'm done with the couch
23791,Matt, So you're just going to let her call the shots?
23792,Stefan, I'm letting her make her own decisions
23793,Matt, Even if they're wrong?
23794,Stefan," Nothing wrong with free will, Matt. Trust me. You don't realize that till you lose it"
23795,Elena, Stefan…
23796,Stefan, Elijah
23797,Elijah, Hello again
23798,Alaric, I need you to tell me where they're keeping Klaus' body
23799,Jeremy," I don't know. And even if I did, why would I tell you?"
23800,Alaric," Elena's association with vampires nearly got her k*ll again tonight, Jeremy. Does that even register with you?"
23801,Jeremy, Of course it does
23802,Alaric," Well, she can't seem to cut them out of her life, but I can. And with your help... I'll get rid of all of them. Find out where Klaus' body is being hidden. I'll k*ll him. All his siblings. And when I die, vampires will no longer exist"
23803,Jeremy, But the only way for you to die is if Elena dies
23804,Alaric," Then lock me up. Have Bonnie put a spell on me like she did Klaus. Let Elena live a long, healthy, human life. And when her life is over... mine will be too"
23805,Alaric," This stake is the one w*apon on earth that can k*ll them. I'm going to get Klaus either way, Jeremy. Be on the right side of this"
23806,Elijah," All we need is to take that stake away from him. Once he's been disarmed, the w*apon's in my possession, my family will scatter to the ends of the earth. And Alaric will follow us"
23807,Stefan, And you'll just... Run
23808,Elijah, We've done it before. Klaus and Rebekah spent the better part of a thousand years evading my father. What's another half century while Elena's able to live out the rest of her natural life?
23809,Elena," We finally stopped him, Elijah. After everything that he's done to us, I can't just let you bring him back"
23810,Elijah," I give you my word, Elena. I will not revive Klaus within yours, nor even within your children's lifetimes. Perhaps it'll finally teach him some manners"
23811,Matt, Why should she trust you? All you've done is screw her over
23812,Elijah," And for that, I'm deeply ashamed. But know this... she could have been dead the instant I walked through that door tonight. So, Elena, I leave it to you to make the decision whether to trust me or not"
23813,Damon, Not! Hello! Did that concussion give you brain damage? His lunatic siblings will k*ll you the first chance they get! 
23814,Elijah, Rebekah and Kol will honor the terms if you return Klaus' body to us... Elena will come to no harm
23815,Elijah, Do we have a deal?
23816,Damon," No! No, no, no, no. Did I mention, no!"
23817,Stefan," Elena, it's up to you"
23818,Damon," Oh, come on!"
23819,Elena, Why do you want Klaus' body?
23820,Elijah, He's my brother. We remain together
23821,Elena, We have a deal
23822,Tyler, Mom?
23823,Carol, In here
23824,Caroline, Mom
23825,Tyler, What's going on?
23826,Carol, Alaric outed us to the council. He told them everything. The whole council knows what you are
23827,Liz," He's got them looking for Klaus, and then they're going to come looking for you. You can't be here when they do"
23828,Caroline, What are you saying?
23829,Liz, You both need to get out of town
23830,Carol," I've pulled together some cash, and Liz has gotten you some new identification. And we'll get school records, and..."
23831,Tyler," well, wait a minute, you want us to run?"
23832,Liz, We can't protect you anymore
23833,Caroline," Well, we can't just pack up and leave!"
23834,Carol," If you stay, you're going to end up dead. You don't have a choice"
23835,Matt, So what are you going to do?
23836,Jeremy," What I want to do is run in that house, grab Elena and get her out of here and away from all this"
23837,Matt," Well, why don't we?"
23838,Jeremy, Good luck getting her past all the vampires in there. Even if I wanted to help Alaric... I have no idea where Klaus' body is
23839,Matt, I do
23840,Alaric, Yes?
23841,Jeremy, I know where Klaus' body is
23842,Alaric, Good. Tell me
23843,Jeremy, Damon's on his way to bury him in the woods off route 12. I'll text you with the specifics
23844,Alaric," Thank you, Jeremy. You're doing the right thing for your sister"
23845,Jeremy, I know
23846,Jeremy, He bought it
23847,Caroline, We can't just leave town
23848,Tyler, Yes we can
23849,Caroline," No, our friends need us"
23850,Tyler, And our mothers need us to stay alive! 
23851,Tyler," Look, Stefan and Damon are going to do whatever it takes to protect themselves, but this is our lives. So let me protect you"
23852,Caroline," I will go anywhere with you. And if we have to spend the rest of our lives running, I will run with you. But, first, I have to help our friends. "
23853,Tyler, I'll get stuff together and meet you at the cell in two hours
23854,Caroline, Deal
23855,Tyler, We've got to travel light. So what do you need?
23856,Caroline," Ah, just you. Maybe a curling iron"
23857,Caroline," Oh, I have to tell Bonnie!"
23858,Tyler," I'll call Bonnie, OK? Two hours. Don't you dare be late"
23859,Caroline, Ok!
23860,Damon, I'm not halfway out of Virginia and Elena sells our soul to the originals?
23861,Bonnie, It's her call
23862,Damon, You know what else is her call? Everything bad ever
23863,Bonnie," Where's the body? As long as it's unspelled, Alaric is one witch away from finding it"
23864,Damon," Hidden. I was going to use unit 666, but I figured that would be a little obvious. So… 1020"
23865,Damon," Mini fridge, a couple of bird cages, box full of ""playboys"""
23866,Damon, One beef jerkified original
23867,Damon, Whoa. Creepy
23868,Bonnie, I need a minute
23869,Damon," Just jam the witch locator bat signal, whatever, and get on with it, Bonnie"
23870,Bonnie, Elena and Jeremy lost Jenna and Alaric because of him. Tyler's a hybrid. My mother's a vampire. Could you give me a minute to just appreciate the sight of him like this?
23871,Bonnie," You should burn in hell. But if you die, so do my friends. So does my mother. What am I supposed"
23872,Elena," Stefan, make sure that Alaric doesn't lay a hand on Jeremy"
23873,Stefan," Jeremy will be fine. Between all of us, we'll have the strength in numbers to disarm Alaric"
23874,Stefan, Hey. What's wrong?
23875,Elena," I... Lately, I feel like every time someone walks out of this house, there's a chance they may not make it back home"
23876,Stefan," Well, I promise... I will do everything in my power to make sure that we all come back"
23877,Elena, Stefan…
23878,Elena, Forget it. We can talk later
23879,Stefan, Just in case there is no later
23880,Damon," Bonnie just left. Rebekah should be here soon, pick up the body"
23881,Stefan, I got Caroline and Elijah in place. Jeremy's going to lead Alaric to us
23882,Damon," You just had to let her make the choice, didn't you?"
23883,Stefan," What would you have done, Damon?"
23884,Damon," Grabbed her, gagged her, threw her in a well. I don't know, anything other than let her trust Elijah!"
23885,Stefan," You know she'd just hate you for it, right?"
23886,Damon, Yet she'd be alive and she'd hate me. Thus the eternal difference between you and me. Brother
23887,Stefan," As soon as we get the stake, hand over the coffin and get out. Alaric's got half the police looking for Klaus' car "
23888,Damon, Will do
23889,Damon, Got to go. The original sister's here
23890,Damon," It's about time, sexy Bex"
23891,Alaric, Where is Klaus?
23892,Damon, How did you find me?
23893,Alaric," Well, you'd be amazed at how competent law enforcement is when it's not corrupted by vampires. Now, where is Klaus?"
23894,Damon, Storage locker. There's only about a thousand of 'em. Have at it
23895,Elena, Thank you
23896,Matt, You're welcome
23897,Matt, Sorry. I over-honeyed. I suck at tea
23898,Matt, So... Stefan
23899,Elena," He saved my life, you know. I never told you that. The night that my parents' car went off the bridge, Stefan was the one that saved me"
23900,Matt, So do you feel like you owe him or something?
23901,Elena," No. It's not that. It's... After the accident, I kind of felt like I didn't know how to live anymore. Like I didn't want to. But then being with Stefan, somehow I figured it out. And that's what love should be. You should love the person that makes you glad that you're alive"
23902,Matt, So then what's the problem?
23903,Elena," The problem's Damon. I... When I'm with him, it just consumes me. And I know that I can't love them both. I know that it's wrong, but I... when I choose one, then I'll lose the other. And I don't want to lose anyone else. I... I just... I wish that I had my mom here to give me some advice"
23904,Elena, Hey it's me
23905,Jenna, Your dad is making me play Pictionary. I suck at Pictionary
23906,Grayson, You do. You're terrible
23907,Jenna," Bite me, Grayson"
23908,Elena," Listen, do you think someone can come pick me up?"
23909,Jenna," Oh, having second thoughts about ditching family night?"
23910,Miranda, Elena? Everything OK?
23911,Elena," Matt and I got into a fight. He was talking about college and marriage and all the stuff that he always talks about, and I just... I couldn't"
23912,Miranda," He doesn't really care about that yet, honey. He's just trying to figure out how you feel about him right now"
23913,Elena, I don't know how I feel
23914,Miranda," Yes, you do. You're just afraid to say it"
23915,Elena," Yeah, but I don't want to lose him"
23916,Miranda," You're not going to lose him, honey. You're setting him free "
23917,Elena, What's going on?
23918,Matt, It's the only way I was going to get you in this truck
23919,Elena, The tea. You drugged me?!
23920,Matt," I'm sorry, Elena. But you're right, OK? You don't have any parents to tell you what's right or wrong. You've got me and Jeremy and a bunch of vampires fighting a w*r you shouldn't be in the middle of"
23921,Elena," What the hell is going on, Matt?"
23922,Matt," I'm getting you out of town, Elena. It's the only way to keep you safe"
23923,Rebekah," Damon! Damon, where are you?"
23924,Rebekah," Damon, this isn't funny"
23925,Damon, Shh
23926,Rebekah, No!
23927,Damon, No! Don't!
23928,Alaric, Next
23929,Damon," Rebekah, run. Run!"
23930,Stefan, Damon?
23931,Damon," Bad news, brother. Alaric staked Klaus. He's dead"
23932,Stefan, I feel OK. Do you feel anything?
23933,Damon, No
23934,Stefan, It took Sage about an hour before she got sick
23935,Damon," Yeah, or Klaus was lying about being the sire of our bloodline"
23936,Stefan," Well, if he wasn't lying... An hour's not enough time to get you all the way back to Mystic Falls"
23937,Damon," What, so we can have an epic good-bye, Stefan?"
23938,Stefan," Not us, brother. You and Elena"
23939,Damon," Well, I guess you'll just have to say good-bye for both us, won't you?"
23940,Damon, Call me if you cough up a lung
23941,Jeremy, Stefan. Elena's not home. Matt and I... We're getting her out of town
23942,Stefan, It's going to be fine. Klaus was lying. We're all going to be OK
23943,Elijah, What happened?
23944,Caroline, Stefan?
23945,Matt," Got it, jer"
23946,Elena," We have to go back. Listen to me, Matt. If Klaus is the one that turned their bloodline, then they're all going to die. We have to go back, Matt!"
23947,Matt, Elena…
23948,Elena, What?
23949,Matt, Damon's not with them
23950,Elena, What?
23951,Matt," He's a hundred Miles out of town. I can keep driving to him, or I can turn around and go back to Stefan. It's your choice"
23952,Damon, Let me guess... calling to see if the grim reaper's paid a visit?
23953,Elena, How are you feeling? Are there any symptoms?
23954,Damon," Not yet. But I'm sure we'll have a laugh when we find out that Klaus is a big, fat liar"
23955,Elena," Yeah, I'm... I'm sure we will"
23956,Damon," Hey, where are you?"
23957,Elena, Matt's taking me home
23958,Damon, To Stefan
23959,Elena, Not just Stefan... Damon. To Tyler. To Caroline
23960,Damon," No Elena I get it. So… Since I'm possibly a dead man, can I ask you a question?"
23961,Elena," Yeah, of course"
23962,Damon," If it was just down to him and me, and you had to make a choice. Who got the good-bye? Who would it be?"
23963,Elena," I love him, Damon. He came into my life at a time when I needed someone, and I fell for him instantly. And no matter what I feel for you, I... I never un-fell for him"
23964,Damon," Hey, I get it. It's Stefan. It's always going to be Stefan"
23965,Elena," I can't think about ""always"". All I can think about is right now. And I care about you, Damon. Which is why I have to let you go"
23966,Elena," I mean, maybe if you and I had met first..."
23967,Damon, Maybe
23968,Elena," You're going to be fine. You hear me? You're going to be OK, and I'm going to see you soon"
23969,Damon," Real soon. Good-bye, Elena"
23970,Damon, I see you're still pissed. I take it goldilocks gave you the slip?
23971,Caroline, Tyler! Tyler!
23972,Tyler, Caroline
23973,Caroline," Tyler, oh, my God!"
23974,Tyler," Hey. Sorry, I was just with Bonnie"
23975,Tyler, What happened?
23976,Caroline, Klaus died. He's dead
23977,Tyler," You're going to be fine, Caroline"
23978,Caroline," No, it's not me that I'm worried about"
23979,Tyler, There's no point. I'm a lost cause
23980,Caroline, No!
23981,Tyler," But you're strong, and you have a beautiful future ahead of you. When you make it through this... Just tell my mother I left town like I was supposed to, OK?"
23982,Tyler, Do you feel anything?
23983,Caroline, No. I feel fine
23984,Tyler, I need you to get out of here. I don't want you to watch me die
23985,Caroline," No, I'm not leaving"
23986,Caroline, I'm staying
23987,Tyler, No
23988,Caroline, Yes
23989,Tyler, You run. Or I'll make you run
23990,Caroline, I'm not leaving!
23991,Tyler, Go!
23992,Elena, You too Care
23993,Matt, What now?
23994,Elena," It's Tyler. He, um... He's..."
23995,Matt, Damn it
23996,Matt," Damn it, damn it, damn it!"
23997,Elena," Matt, no, stop it"
23998,Matt," This isn't how our lives were supposed to be, Elena"
23999,Rebekah," He's gone, Elijah. There was nothing I could do to stop it"
24000,Elijah," Tyler Lockwood is dead, but the rest survived. You said that Nicklaus turned their bloodline"
24001,Rebekah, I thought he did
24002,Elijah," It wasn't me, it wasn't Kol"
24003,Rebekah," It wasn't me, Elijah. It was Nicklaus, I'm sure of it"
24004,Elijah, Then how are they still alive?
24005,Bonnie, I know you're here
24006,Tyler," I must say, you executed the swapping spell brilliantly. I didn't think you had it in you"
24007,Bonnie," I did it to save my friends and my mother, Klaus. Not you"
24008,Tyler/Klaus, The spirits won't be happy with you
24009,Bonnie, Spirits don't get to tell me what to do anymore. I'm done getting pushed around by all of you. I did it because I wanted to
24010,Stefan, Hello?
24011,Rebekah, You're alive. Congratulations
24012,Stefan, Rebekah
24013,Rebekah, Elijah spoke to Elena. Her and Matt should be arriving back in town any minute
24014,Stefan," Yeah, he told me that. He also said you two would be long gone out of town by now"
24015,Rebekah," That's the problem. Elijah says that we have to run, that the hunter will keep coming after us, but I don't want to run anymore, Stefan. I've spent my whole life running"
24016,Stefan, What are you talking about? We had a deal
24017,Rebekah," I'm sorry, but Klaus is dead. There is no deal. If my brothers and I are going to survive, we need to get rid of Alaric, and the only way to get rid of Alaric..."
24018,Stefan," Rebekah, no"
24019,Elena," I need to call Stefan, but my phone is dying"
24020,Matt, Here. Use mine
24021,Elena, Thanks
24022,Elena," Matt, look out!"
24023,Elena, Dad? Dad!
24024,Grayson, We're going to be OK. I promise
24025,Alaric, You're not going to fight back?
24026,Damon," You're kind of invincible, Ric"
24027,Alaric, Don't call me that. We're not friends
24028,Damon, We were
24029,Alaric," Well, our friendship was part of the problem. It's what kept me weak. That's why it took so long for the real me to break through. And now I'm going to break you"
24030,Elena," I know, Bonnie, you're right. You and my mom both are. I just can't bring myself to tell him. At least not tonight. I'll call you later"
24031,Damon, Katherine
24032,Elena, Um... No. I... I'm Elena
24033,Damon, Oh. You... you just look... I'm sorry. You just really remind me of someone. I'm Damon
24034,Elena," Not to be rude or anything, Damon, but it's kind of creepy that you're out here in the middle of nowhere"
24035,Damon, You're one to talk. You're out here all by yourself
24036,Elena, It's Mystic Falls. Nothing bad ever happens here. I got into a fight with my boyfriend
24037,Damon, About what? May I ask?
24038,Elena," Life, the future. He's got it all mapped out"
24039,Damon, And you don't want it?
24040,Elena, I don't know what I want
24041,Damon," Well, that's not true. You want what everybody wants..."
24042,Elena, what? Mysterious stranger who has all the answers
24043,Damon," Hmm. Well, let's just say I've been around a long time. I've learned a few things"
24044,Elena," So, Damon... Tell me. What is it that I want?"
24045,Damon," You want a love that consumes you. You want passion and adventure, and even a little danger"
24046,Elena," So, what do you want?"
24047,Elena, That's my parents
24048,Damon," I want you to get everything you're looking for. But right now I want you to forget that this happened. I can't have people knowing I'm in town yet. Good night, Elena"
24049,Damon, Is that all you got?
24050,Alaric, Not quite
24051,Alaric, What's happening?
24052,Damon, No!
24053,Alaric, What's happening?!
24054,Damon, What?
24055,Damon," No! No! No, no, no, no!"
24056,Damon, Ric!
24057,Damon, You're not dead. You're not dead!
24058,Jeremy," Matt, where are you guys? You should have been back by now"
24059,Alaric, Jeremy
24060,Jeremy, I think you've done enough. How did you even get in here?
24061,Alaric, I don't know. I just wanted to say good-bye and it kind of happened
24062,Jeremy, Ric?
24063,Alaric," I just want you to know... That I will always be here to look after you, Jeremy. And you'll never be alone. OK? I promise"
24064,Jeremy," I don't understand. Oh, my God, you're a ghost. But if you're dead... It means Elena..."
24065,Damon, Where is she?
24066,Meredith, Damon…
24067,Damon, Where is she?
24068,Meredith," Wait! You need to know, when Jeremy brought Elena in here earlier tonight, her injuries were worse than I let on. It wasn't a concussion. It was a cerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding on the brain"
24069,Damon, What are you saying?
24070,Meredith, He was so worried. I didn't want to tell him but i… I helped her. She needed my help
24071,Damon, You what?!
24072,Elena, Stefan?
24073,Stefan, Hey. I'm right here. You've been in and out for hours
24074,Elena, Wh... what happened?
24075,Stefan, You were in an accident
24076,Elena," Oh my god. Matt, is he..."
24077,Damon," Alive? Ask Stefan, the hero"
24078,Stefan, He's fine
24079,Elena, Thank you. I thought that I... How did you...
24080,Damon, Save you? He didn't
24081,Stefan," When Jeremy brought you to the hospital before all of this happened, your injuries were worse than anyone knew. Meredith Fell made a choice. She used Damon's bl*od to heal you"
24082,Damon," And when Rebecca ran Matt's truck off the road, you had vampire bl*od in your system, Elena"
24083,Elena, Oh my god. Does... does that mean that I... Am I dead?
24084,Elena," No. No, no, no! That... that wasn't supposed to happen!"
24085,Stefan, Maybe it doesn't have to. I talked to Bonnie. She said she's stronger than ever. There might be something she can do to help you
24086,Damon," No, the only thing that's going to help is for you to feed and complete the transition"
24087,Stefan," We have all day before she has to feed, Damon. That's a day to exhaust every possible way out of this"
24088,Damon, There is no way out of it! We all know the drill... You feed or you die. There is no door number three
24089,Elena," I was ready to die. I was supposed to die, I don't... I don't want... I can't be a vampire!"
24090,Elena," If there's something that Bonnie can do, we have to try it"
24091,Stefan, We will. We'll try everything
24092,Damon," Your choice, Elena. As always"
24093,Damon, Way to get her hopes up for something that's never happened in the history of vampirism
24094,Stefan, Know what? You weren't there the day Elena looked me in the eye and told me she absolutely never wanted this
24095,Damon, Then you shouldn't have let her die
24096,Stefan, I never meant for her to die. She asked me to help Matt first and I did
24097,Damon," And now the world has one more quarterback. Bravo, brother"
24098,Stefan, I made a choice that I will regret for the rest of my life. Now let me try to fix it
24099,Elena, Jer!
24100,Jeremy, Are you OK? I watched Vickie go through this. She was a mess. Her emotions were all over the place. All of these old memories came flooding back
24101,Elena, I'm fine. I'm not Vickie
24102,Jeremy," No, you're not. You're you. You act like everything's OK so no one worries about you, but you need help"
24103,Elena, I said I'm fine okay?
24104,Elena," I... I'm sorry, I... Have you talked to Bonnie?"
24105,Jeremy, Yeah. She said when I was sh*t; she made some plea to the witch spirits to bring me back. And they listened
24106,Elena," Yeah, but the consequences were horrible"
24107,Jeremy, And what could be more horrible than you turning into a vampire? I need my sister. Not another one of them
24108,Elena, We're going to find a way out of this. Everything's going to be OK
24109,Jeremy, I hope so
24110,Tyler/Klaus," It's beautiful, isn't it?"
24111,Bonnie," What is that doing here, Klaus? The deal we made with Tyler was that you'd leave his body and jump into someone else's the first chance you got"
24112,Tyler/Klaus," Yes. When I assumed I'd be a pile of Ash. But apparently fate and oxygen intervened, and there I am. Put me back"
24113,Bonnie, I can't right now
24114,Tyler/Klaus, Your history teacher outed Tyler and Caroline to the council. They're on the w*r path and this body's vulnerable
24115,Bonnie, I have to help Elena before she has to feed
24116,Tyler/Klaus, Elena's dead and no longer my concern
24117,Bonnie, You're forgetting who just saved your life
24118,Tyler/Klaus, You're forgetting I can rip your tongue out! Now put... me... back
24119,Bonnie," If I can keep Elena human, you'll still have an endless bl*od supply to make your hybrids. Isn't that what you really want?"
24120,Tyler/Klaus," Same rules apply. No one knows. No one. Do you understand me, Bonnie?"
24121,Meredith, Pastor Young. To what do we owe the honor? And don't tell me it's your bl*od pressure again
24122,Pastor Young," Honestly, Dr. Fell, I wish it were"
24123,Pastor Young, bl*od banks in the basement. One of you sweep the rooms
24124,Meredith, What are you doing?
24125,Pastor Young, Adding a few security measures. The bl*od in this place has a habit of flying off the shelves
24126,Meredith, Who gave you that authority?
24127,Pastor Young," The council. They've entrusted me to secure the town. And unlike some of our founding families, I don't have conflicting interests"
24128,Meredith, What is that supposed to mean?
24129,Pastor Young," Alaric Saltzman told us everything, Meredith. Probably time to start looking for a new job"
24130,Matt, Elena doesn't want to be a vampire
24131,Caroline," She doesn't want to be dead, and now she's not. This isn't your fault, Matt"
24132,Matt, This is all my fault. I was driving. I was saved. She's a vampire because of me!
24133,Caroline," Shh! Cool it on the ""v"" word. I'm a fugitive, remember? I'm supposed to be halfway to Florida by now"
24134,Matt," If the council's after you, then why are you here?"
24135,Caroline," Because I don't know where to go. Tyler's dead, and everything's different now. And I..."
24136,Matt, Can I help you?
24137,Man, Sorry
24138,Man, All good here
24139,Carol, What's going on?
24140,Pastor Young, We just need to ask you a few questions about your son
24141,Carol, You can't arrest me. I'm the mayor of this town
24142,Pastor Young," Not anymore, you're not"
24143,Pastor Young," Sorry, Liz. You're not going to work today"
24144,Liz, What are you talking about? What's going on?
24145,Pastor Young, They're taking your badge. You're not fit to protect us anymore
24146,Liz, You have no idea what you're up against
24147,Pastor Young," On the contrary, Liz. I've already taken your deputies. We've got the entire town's supply of vervain, including the stash found in the Salvatore house. We're making our move"
24148,Caroline, Mom! Hey
24149,Liz," Caroline, where are you? And tell me it's far away"
24150,Caroline," Where am I? Good question. Uh, just a whole lot of boring highways. Why? Is everything OK?"
24151,Liz," Caroline, what's going on?"
24152,Stefan, It's disgusting
24153,Elena," No, it's, um..."
24154,Stefan, It's disgusting
24155,Elena," Yeah, I'm going to puke"
24156,Elena," I never thought I'd be saying this, but I can't stop thinking about bl*od"
24157,Stefan, I should have saved you first. You shouldn't be going through this right now
24158,Elena," No, if you had saved me, then Matt would be dead. What do you think I'd be going through then? Stefan, listen to me. You did the right thing. You did what you always do... You respected my choice"
24159,Stefan," And what am I supposed to do if Bonnie can't figure out a way to help you, huh? Because then you'll have another choice to make... Either let yourself die, or be a vampire"
24160,Elena," Well, then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Oh, my God. Did... Did I just say, ""cross that bridge""?"
24161,Stefan, You're laughing. I'm pretty sure you don't actually think that's funny
24162,Elena," I can't stop, though"
24163,Stefan, Your emotions are a bit heightened today. A lot heightened
24164,Stefan, Hey
24165,Stefan, Shh. It's OK. It's OK
24166,Elena," I'm sorry, I..."
24167,Stefan," Listen to me. No matter what happens, I'm here for you. I can help you"
24168,Elena," Yeah, I... I..."
24169,Stefan, Why don't you go back upstairs where it's dark. I'll clean up
24170,Elena, I thought you left
24171,Damon, Cute pjs
24172,Elena, I'm tired Damon 
24173,Damon, I brought you this
24174,Elena, I thought that was gone. Thank you
24175,Elena, Please give it back
24176,Damon, I just have to say something
24177,Elena, Why do you have to say it with my necklace? 
24178,Damon," Well, because what I'm about to say is… probably the most selfish thing I have ever said in my life"
24179,Elena," Damon, don't go there"
24180,Damon," No, I just have to say it once. You just need to hear it. I love you, Elena and it's because I love you that… I can't be selfish with you. Why you can't know this? I don't deserve you but my brother does"
24181,Damon," God, I wish you don't have to forget this but you do"
24182,Rebekah, You should know better than to sneak up on a lady
24183,Damon, Good advice. Have you seen one?
24184,Rebekah," Tragic about Elena. Not to make the gray cloud grayer, but does Matt even have automobile insurance?"
24185,Elena, Stefan?
24186,Stefan," Elena, don't move"
24187,Tyler/Klaus," Ah, you incessant woman"
24188,Tyler/Klaus," Hey, mom. What's up?"
24189,Carol," Tyler, thank God. Are you OK?"
24190,Tyler/Klaus, Fine. Why? What's going on?
24191,Carol," Pastor Young had me arrested this morning. The council grilled me on your whereabouts. Tyler, don't tell me where you are. The less I know, the better"
24192,Tyler," Mom, I'm OK. Relax"
24193,Carol," You didn't answer your phone, honey. I was so scared that you were with Caroline"
24194,Tyler, Why? What happened to Caroline?
24195,Carol, The council took her
24196,Tyler, What do you mean they took her?
24197,Caroline, Vervain ropes. Looks like Alaric outed us all to the council
24198,Rebekah, The council... What exactly do they think they can do to me?
24199,Rebekah, What the hell happened?
24200,Caroline, Tyler?
24201,Tyler/Klaus, I'm harder to k*ll than you think
24202,Caroline, You're alive?!
24203,Caroline," Tyler, you're alive!"
24204,Tyler/Klaus, No time. Come on. We got to go
24205,Rebekah," Wait, what about me?"
24206,Tyler/Klaus," Keep 'em busy, little sister"
24207,Rebekah, That's impossible!
24208,Damon," They're gone. Whoever nailed Rebekah took them, too. Please tell me you have something. Anything"
24209,Liz," I can't. The council locked Carol and me out of our offices. Files, computers, everything"
24210,Damon," So the mayor and the sheriff never contemplated a back-up plan, Liz?"
24211,Meredith," Damon, relax"
24212,Meredith," When Caroline called to say she got away, did she know where they were planning to take her?"
24213,Liz," No, just that she was in some van in the middle of nowhere and she managed to escape"
24214,Damon, Perfect. We've narrowed it down to nowhere
24215,Matt, Hey. Is Elena here?
24216,Damon, In what world are you the one that gets to live?!
24217,Meredith," Damon, stop! It wasn't his fault!"
24218,Liz," Let him go, Damon. Now"
24219,Pastor Young, Still want to be a writer? I remember how you'd read your short stories to my daughter when you'd baby-sit. She still loves writing because of you
24220,Elena, Why did you bring me here?
24221,Pastor Young, My deputies can watch out for us here. No vampires have been invited in
24222,Pastor Young," Look, Elena, I know it sounds crazy, but years ago it was your parents who were advocating having an emergency plan for this. I never thought we'd actually have to use it"
24223,Pastor Young, Elena? Are you okay?
24224,Elena, Where's Stefan?
24225,Pastor Young, Where he can't hurt you
24226,Elena, He would never hurt me. You have no idea what you're talking about
24227,Pastor Young," Well, I know that where you go, Salvatore vampires seem to follow. Are you hungry?"
24228,Elena, No
24229,Pastor Young," So we'll hold Stefan until Damon comes searching for you two. And we'll use Rebekah to lure her siblings back into town. You'll give us the white oak stake, and then... We will exterminate the entire vampire race for good"
24230,Pastor Young, Something wrong?
24231,Pastor Young," Elena, are you OK?"
24232,Elena, Yeah
24233,Elena, I've got to get out of here
24234,Pastor Young, Get her!
24235,Caroline, I never thought I'd see you again! I don't get it. How are you alive?
24236,Tyler/Klaus," This is going to sound incredible, but..."
24237,Tyler/Klaus," Easy, love. Wrong time, wrong place, wrong equipment"
24238,Caroline, You're miraculously alive. We're fugitives on the run. All signs point to hot hybrid vampire sex
24239,Caroline," Did you just call me ""love""?"
24240,Tyler/Klaus," I don't know, love. Did I?"
24241,Caroline, What the hell did you do to Tyler?
24242,Tyler/Klaus, That's what I enjoy about you. So much more than a pretty face
24243,Caroline," Oh, my God. You're Klaus! You're disgusting!"
24244,Tyler/Klaus, And you're a glorious kisser.
24245,Tyler/Klaus, Listen... I didn't have to risk exposure to come save you
24246,Caroline," Oh, you do one semi-decent thing and now you're my hero? Ugh! I need to go sanitize my mouth"
24247,Tyler/Klaus, Your mouth was all over me. I was an innocent v*ctim
24248,Caroline, Put Tyler back
24249,Tyler/Klaus, Gladly. Then maybe I'll take you up on your offer of hot hybrid sex
24250,Bonnie, The spirits aren't listening
24251,Jeremy," Well, is that it? Is that all we can do?"
24252,Bonnie, There's something else I could try
24253,Jeremy, What? Do it
24254,Bonnie," If the witches won't help me save Elena, then maybe I could go to the other side and bring her back myself"
24255,Jeremy, The other side? The other side's for dead people
24256,Bonnie," She's still in transition. Not fully dead, not fully alive. What if her spirit still exists on both sides?"
24257,Jeremy," Even if it does, how can you get there? You're not dead"
24258,Jeremy," No. No, Bonnie!"
24259,Bonnie, I was able to stop your heart to stop Klaus'. I'll do the same thing to myself. Witches have free reign on the other side. I will find Elena and I will bring her back with me
24260,Jeremy, Assuming you wake up!
24261,Bonnie, I'm stronger now. I found a new source of power
24262,Jeremy, A new source of power?! What kind of powers can let you k*ll yourself and bring someone back with you from the dead?
24263,Bonnie, Do you want Elena back or not?
24264,Liz," With your vervain and Alaric's w*apon, they could be anywhere"
24265,Damon," Come on, guys, think. It takes a lot to hold a vampire. Reinforced steel, iron doors"
24266,Matt, The pastor has a cattle ranch
24267,Matt, Those pens could easily be modified
24268,Meredith," It's remote, it's secluded"
24269,Damon," Well, guess what. Looks like you get a chance to prove how sorry you really are. Let's go"
24270,Rebekah, I thought I k*ll you
24271,Elena, Where am I?
24272,Rebekah, They thought you were a vampire so they stuck you in here with us
24273,Elena, Where's Stefan?
24274,Stefan," Elena, I'm right here"
24275,Stefan, Are you okay?
24276,Elena, Stefan...
24277,Elena, I need to feed
24278,Rebekah, Ah. I see what's going on here. You died with vampire bl*od in your system and you didn't feed and now you're locked up in here without a drop of human bl*od in sight. That is a problem
24279,Stefan, Just ignore her
24280,Rebekah," Has anyone done the math, or shall I? I'd say you've got less than three hours to feed before I get to watch you die all over again"
24281,Rebekah, My day just got a whole lot better
24282,Jeremy, Oh my god
24283,Jeremy," Bonnie! Bonnie. Open your eyes. Bonnie, I can't let you do this"
24284,Jeremy, You're dying!
24285,Jeremy, What the hell is that?!
24286,Jeremy," Bonnie, no!"
24287,Jeremy," Bonnie. Bonnie, wake up! Bonnie wake up!"
24288,Bonnie, Elena…
24289,Bonnie, Come back. Come back Elena
24290,Elena," Stefan? Stefan, something's happening"
24291,Bonnie, You're going home
24292,Sheila, No!
24293,Bonnie, Grams? What are you doing?
24294,Sheila, You can't be in here. You stay away from this sort of darkness
24295,Bonnie, Elena needs me
24296,Sheila, she is not your problem to solve. Now go. Before they try to keep you here
24297,Bonnie," Grams, please!"
24298,Sheila," This magic is dark, Bonnie. It is not nature's plan. Touch it again, and the spirits will unleash their anger in ways that will make you suffer. Stay away. Go!"
24299,Jeremy," Bonnie, wake up! Wake up! Come on. Bonnie, open your eyes"
24300,Jeremy, Ha! You're awake!
24301,Jeremy, You're alive
24302,Bonnie, I couldn't do it. It didn't work
24303,Elena, Stefan…
24304,Stefan, What happened?
24305,Elena, I'm out of time. I need bl*od. I'm dying
24306,Stefan, Hey! Anyone! Hey!
24307,Rebekah, Will you shut up?
24308,Stefan, You think we're afraid of you?
24309,Deputy, You want more vervain? Keep it down
24310,Stefan, Listen to me. Elena's going to die if you don't let her out of here
24311,Deputy, Sorry. Not my problem
24312,Stefan, She's innocent. Let her out
24313,Elena, Stop!
24314,Stefan, I said let her out!
24315,Jeremy, She said she's not strong enough!
24316,Tyler/Klaus, You were strong enough to put me in here. Surely you're strong enough to get me out
24317,Bonnie, I upset the spirits trying to save Elena. I can't use that kind of magic again. It's too dangerous
24318,Tyler/Klaus," Bonnie, do the bloody spell!"
24319,Caroline," She said she can't, OK?"
24320,Caroline," We'll just wait a few days until you're strong enough to do it with traditional magic. Right, Bonnie?"
24321,Caroline, What are you doing?
24322,Tyler/Klaus, Ripping Tyler's heart out. I'll jump into someone else
24323,Tyler/Klaus, Maybe you
24324,Bonnie, Oh my god
24325,Caroline," Oh, my God, stop, stop!"
24326,Jeremy, He's bluffing. He needs a witch to do that
24327,Tyler/Klaus," What makes you think I don't have one? Or ten? Pick, Bonnie! You or Tyler!"
24328,Caroline, Stop! Please! You're k*ll him!
24329,Bonnie," Fine, I'll do it! Just stop"
24330,Tyler/Klaus, Good. Let's begin
24331,Stefan, Elena. Are you still with me?
24332,Elena," Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I'm okay"
24333,Stefan," No, you're not. I can hear your breathing"
24334,Stefan, Damon was right. You should have fed this morning. I'm so sorry
24335,Elena, Don't be. You had hope. That's all I ever wanted you to have. And you had it
24336,Stefan, I love you so much
24337,Elena," Do you know why I was even on that bridge? I was coming back for you, Stefan. I had to choose, and... I picked you. Because I love you"
24338,Elena, No matter what happens... It's the best choice I ever made. God... it sucks I can't see you right now
24339,Stefan, I'm smiling
24340,Elena, Me too
24341,Matt," So, what, we just storm the place with zero w*apon?"
24342,Damon," No, we don't need w*apon. Just bait"
24343,Damon, Yoo-hoo! Anybody home? Big bad vampire out here
24344,Pastor Young," Let him go, the boy's innocent"
24345,Damon," Well, that's the point. Give me Stefan and Elena, he's all yours"
24346,Damon," Come on, pastor. You know I'll k*ll him. I want to k*ll him"
24347,Pastor Young, Go way! You are not invited in! And I'm not coming out
24348,Jeremy, This is black magic. She shouldn't be doing this
24349,Caroline, Tyler?
24350,Tyler, Caroline
24351,Tyler, Hey
24352,Jeremy, Bonnie. What are you doing?
24353,Sheila, I warned you child
24354,Sheila, I warned you to stay away
24355,Jeremy," Bonnie, it works. Stop"
24356,Bonnie, What's happening? Let me go!
24357,Sheila, I can't
24358,Bonnie, Let me go!
24359,Caroline," Bonnie, what's happening?"
24360,Bonnie, I can't let her go!
24361,Jeremy," Bonnie, stop the spell!"
24362,Sheila, You made your choice. Now they're taking it out on me
24363,Bonnie," I'm sorry, grams! They can't do this to you! Please! Don't do this to her!"
24364,Caroline," Bonnie, stop!"
24365,Bonnie, No! No! No!
24366,Bonnie, Oh my god! What have I done?! What did I do?!
24367,Jeremy," You're OK, you're OK"
24368,Bonnie, What did I do? What did I do?
24369,Deputy 1, I got this. Bring the other one in
24370,Rebekah, Excuse me? Sir
24371,Deputy, I thought I told you to shut up
24372,Rebekah," Here's the thing... My family, we... We have money. Castles, apartments, jewelry. Just name your price and let me out"
24373,Deputy, I'd much rather watch you die
24374,Stefan," Elena, Elena"
24375,Matt, Go ahead and k*ll me. You can't possibly hate me more than I hate myself
24376,Damon," Oh, yes, I can. It should have been you"
24377,Elena, Leave him alone!
24378,Matt, Just stop! Stop saving me
24379,Stefan, What the hell is your problem?
24380,Matt," What do you want me to say, thank you? Because honestly, I wish you'd just let me drown"
24381,Stefan," What, you think you were my first choice?"
24382,Matt, Elena's a vampire because of me. I have to live with that every day for the rest of my life
24383,Stefan," No, no, you don't have to live with that, you get to live with that. Because Elena put your life before her own. So every morning when you get out of bed, you sure as hell better earn it"
24384,Elena, You were going to k*ll him
24385,Damon, Yep. The guy just won't die
24386,Elena, It was my choice to save him. Why aren't you seeing that?
24387,Damon," It's a little hard to keep track of all your choices lately, Elena"
24388,Elena, I remember everything
24389,Elena, One of the highlights of my transition... Remembering everything that you compelled me to forget
24390,Elena," Like how you and I met first. We were strangers. And you told me you wanted me to get everything I wanted from life. Damon, why didn't you tell me?"
24391,Damon, Would it have made a difference?
24392,Damon, I didn't think so
24393,Elena," You asked me to make a choice, Damon. So I did. If you're going to be mad, then take it out on me, not on Stefan or Matt or anyone else. Me"
24394,Damon, Are we done here?
24395,Elena," If it had been you at the bridge last night and not Stefan, and I begged you to save Matt..."
24396,Damon," I would have saved you. In a b*at, no question"
24397,Elena, That's what I thought. Then Matt would be dead because you couldn't let go. Matt would be dead!
24398,Damon," But you wouldn't be. And you would have gotten to grow up. And had the life that you wanted; the life that you deserve. And I know that I didn't used to get that, but I do now. And I wanted that for you, Elena. And I would have gladly have given it to you and let Matt die because I am that selfish. But you knew that already. The first night we met's not all you remember."
24399,Rebekah, How dare you save Caroline over me!
24400,Klaus," ""Hello, brother, I thought you were dead. So pleased you're not."""
24401,Rebekah, You left me
24402,Klaus," I only had time to save one of you and you can't be k*ll. Rest assured, I had a worse day than you. I think it's time for us to move on, find some more werewolves"
24403,Rebekah, So you can create your hybrid family? You don't know anything about family!
24404,Klaus," Well, I know how easily they can be silenced with a dagger"
24405,Klaus, No!
24406,Klaus, Drop them
24407,Rebekah, I mourned you! My heart broke thinking I'd never see you again!
24408,Klaus," Put the bl*od down, Rebekah, there's a good girl"
24409,Rebekah," It's always been me! Not Finn. Not Elijah, not Kol, me. I loved you through everything and you don't even care"
24410,Klaus, Drop it!
24411,Rebekah, You want your family? Here's your family
24412,Klaus," You know something, Rebekah, you were right. I don't care. From this moment on, you're not my family, you're not my sister. You are nothing"
24413,Elena, The whole council knows who we are now. Everything's about to change
24414,Stefan," Yeah, I'm sure Damon has a revenge plan cooked up. We'll figure out a way to deal with it"
24415,Elena," Stefan, you don't have to convince me that everything's going to be OK"
24416,Stefan," I know. Wish I could, though. Wish I could just tell you that you'll never feel pain. That you'll never crave bl*od. But you will. It will be the worst thing that you've ever lived through"
24417,Elena," But I'll get to live. I'll be a sister and a friend, and... I'll be with you. If I want"
24418,Elena," I'm going to get through this. The same way we've been through everything, one day at a time. We should get inside before sunrise"
24419,Stefan, Bonnie made this for you yesterday
24420,Stefan, Just in case
24421,Elena, Daylight ring?
24422,Stefan," One day at a time, right?"
24423,Pastor Young," Folks, by now you know that the vampires have escaped. And it won't be long before they retaliate against us. But fear not. For I have been chosen to lead us in a movement"
24424,Man, What are you talking about?
24425,Pastor Young," Hear me, loved ones. Soon we'll be free to pass through the gates... And we'll all reunite in eternity"
24426,Man," Seriously, pastor, what's going on here?"
24427,Pastor Young, Friends... We are the beginning
24428,Elena, Hi
24429,Stefan, Hi
24430,Damon, You're making a big mistake
24431,Stefan," No, I'm not. If I can get Elena used to animal bl*od right out the gate..."
24432,Damon, You're reaching
24433,Stefan, Maybe she'll be able to bypass all the things that we went through
24434,Damon, Delusional
24435,Stefan, Maybe she actually has a sh*t at this
24436,Damon," Wrong. You're just wrong, Stefan"
24437,Stefan," She won't be able to handle it if she hurts someone, Damon. Her compassion is her Achilles' heel and everything is magnified right now"
24438,Damon, Then you better hope she's not a fan of Bambi
24439,Stefan, Close your eyes
24440,Damon," She needs human bl*od, Stefan. From the vein"
24441,Stefan," Oh, come on, you know what happens. You name me a vampire who didn't k*ll at least one person when they were new"
24442,Damon, You name me one who went on the bunny diet and didn't k*ll dozens
24443,Stefan," If she k*ll someone, she will crumble. How much pain do you think she can take before she shuts off her humanity switch?"
24444,Damon, It happens to the best of us at least once
24445,Damon," We get over it, Stefan. A hundred years or so"
24446,Stefan," Yeah, well, I think I'd like her to skip that part"
24447,Damon, She can't learn to control the bl*od lust if she's never actually experienced the bl*od lust
24448,Stefan, What are you doing? Knock it off
24449,Damon, It's like a cheat. Like giving a kid a calculator before they know math
24450,Stefan, I said stop
24451,Stefan," Don't worry, he'll heel. Bigger animals are more resilient"
24452,Stefan, Hey. You did it. I know it's hard. But you can do this
24453,Elena, Whoa. What's going on?
24454,Stefan," Oh, we're just having a little disagreement about process, right?"
24455,Elena, You're still not on board with the animal plan
24456,Damon," Nope. I say rip off the proverbial Band-Aid and let it bleed. You're a vampire, Elena. Be a vampire"
24457,Stefan, You ready to go?
24458,Damon, vampires eat people
24459,Damon, It's part of the natural food pyramid. Trust me. You're going to be miserable
24460,Elena, I can't do it
24461,Stefan," All right, it's like the starting line of a race, right? So you just push off with every ounce of strength that you have, ok?"
24462,Elena, I was a cheerleader. I sucked at track
24463,Stefan," Just concentrate, ok? You can do it"
24464,Elena, I can't. All I can think about is your hands on my body
24465,Stefan, Oh ok
24466,Elena," No, no, no, I didn't…"
24467,Elena, I didn't say take them off. It feels good
24468,Stefan, Yeah? What does it feel like?
24469,Elena, It feels like you're touching every nerve on my body
24470,Stefan, Everything is heightened
24471,Stefan, Taste. The smell. Sight. Touch
24472,Damon, This seat's taken
24473,Damon," ""Faulty gas line leads to tragic expl*si*n at Young farm"". Really?"
24474,Liz," Better than ""Town council blown up, police have no suspects"". Unless the perpetrator's right next to me"
24475,Damon," Well, don't look at me. I always take credit for k*ll people"
24476,Damon," Seriously, stop looking at me like that, Liz. If I was going to k*ll ten people, I wouldn't blow 'em up. I'd have a dinner party"
24477,Liz, The expl*si*n was sparked from inside. This wasn't an accident
24478,Damon," You say that like it's a bad thing. The council's dead, Liz. I see that as a win"
24479,Liz, I've known some of the council since I was a kid. They were my friends
24480,Damon," Well, your friends tried to k*ll your daughter. Who's the new guy?"
24481,Man," Excuse me, sheriff. Hi. I was wondering if I could speak to you for a minute. It's about the expl*si*n at the Young farm"
24482,Liz," I'm sorry, mister..."
24483,Man," Oh, Connor Jordan"
24484,Liz, Are you with the insurance investigators?
24485,Connor," No, no, I'm more of an independent contractor. Can we speak in private?"
24486,Liz, Sure
24487,Connor, Thanks
24488,Damon," Nice to meet you, too, Mr. Busybody Guy"
24489,Matt, So what are these again?
24490,Jeremy, They're paper lanterns. Student council made them for after the memorial. You light them up in honor of all the dead
24491,Matt, Nobody thought fire might be a little inappropriate?
24492,Jeremy," Yeah, I wouldn't make that crack in front of Elena"
24493,Matt, How is she?
24494,Jeremy, I guess she's fine... considering
24495,Matt," If there's anything I can do, you know, short of giving her a ride, you'll let me know, right? I'm only alive because she told Stefan to save me first. She's a vampire because of me, so I'd like to pay it back or forward or whatever"
24496,Jeremy, Yeah
24497,Girl, Jeremy?
24498,Girl, Picture an emo pixie cut and braces
24499,Jeremy, April?
24500,April, Yeah
24501,Jeremy," Oh, you look great"
24502,Jeremy, Do you remember April? Elena used to…
24503,Matt," Elena used to baby-sit you, yeah, I remember"
24504,April," Yeah, before I got shipped off to boarding school by my dad"
24505,Jeremy," Your dad. Oh, my God, I am so sorry about your dad"
24506,April, Thank you. I guess. I sort of don't know how to answer when people say that
24507,Matt," Your dad was Pastor Young, right?"
24508,April," He of the faulty gas line. Sorry. I haven't figured out what to say about that yet, either. Wow, I am being a freak. I'm just, you know, not much for grief, I guess. I have to go register... Or something. I think"
24509,Elena," Hey, care, it's me. I'm back. I, um... Can you call me? I've been having some... adjustment issues"
24510,Elena, Hey
24511,Stefan, Hi
24512,Elena," Well, what's that for?"
24513,Stefan, This is from the year you were born. I think we should celebrate
24514,Elena, Celebrate what?
24515,Stefan, Your first feed. I know it was disgusting and traumatic and it was horrible. But you did it anyway. You survived it
24516,Elena," Well, um... I wouldn't say I survived it. It actually kind of made me sick"
24517,Stefan," Listen, I choked it down for a month before I could stomach the taste. It gets easier. This, on the other hand, will go down like silk"
24518,Elena, You're so cheery
24519,Stefan," Yeah, because you're here. You're...alive. Ish. And, uh, you're going… you're going to get through this. So, would you like to do the honors?"
24520,Elena, Okay
24521,Elena, Oh!
24522,Elena, Oh my god
24523,Stefan, Cheers
24524,Stefan," Ah, perfect timing, Damon. Yeah, we just got back. What?"
24525,Elena, Did you do it?
24526,Damon, That seat's taken
24527,Elena, But there's no one here
24528,Damon," Well, I'm just going to pretend like there's someone there because the alternative's just too damn depressing"
24529,Elena, Did you set off the expl*si*n that k*ll the town council?
24530,Damon," Am I wearing my ""I blew up the council"" t-shirt? Why does everybody keep asking me that?"
24531,Elena, Did you?
24532,Damon, No. Anything else?
24533,Elena, Yes. Something's wrong. I can't keep any of the animal bl*od down
24534,Damon," Well, there's a shock"
24535,Elena, I think I need your help
24536,Damon, Of course you do. Pick your meal
24537,Damon," You got Asian fusion, Mexican, what about some good old American comfort food?"
24538,Elena, No. No human bl*od. Stefan's right. I have to at least try to get through this without hurting anyone
24539,Damon, Fine. Come on
24540,Elena, What are you doing?
24541,Damon, Giving you what you need. Drink
24542,Elena, What?
24543,Damon, You're a new vampire Elena. You need warm bl*od from the vein. Maybe this will do the trick. Just don't tell Stefan
24544,Elena, Why?
24545,Damon, Because bl*od sharing is kind of...personal
24546,Elena," What do you mean, it's personal?"
24547,Damon, Just drink!
24548,Caroline, This is wrong. A bunch of people died and we're having sex
24549,Tyler, Grief sex. It's healthy
24550,Caroline, It's selfish
24551,Tyler," It's natural. Besides, if we stopped having sex every time somebody died in this town, we'd explode"
24552,Caroline, We need to be more sensitive
24553,Caroline, Tyler
24554,Tyler," Oh, come on. I love you. How's that for sensitive?"
24555,Caroline, I love you too
24556,Tyler, Who the hell is that?
24557,Carol, May I help you?
24558,Connor," Good evening. I'm hoping I can help you, actually. I spoke with Sheriff Forbes earlier. My name is Connor Jordan"
24559,Carol, Carol Lockwood
24560,Carol," I know who you are, Connor. And I believe the sheriff made it clear that the tragedy at the farm house was an internal matter"
24561,Connor," That's one way of looking at it, I guess. Although I prefer the term ""cover-up"". Do you mind if I come in?"
24562,Carol," You know, I really don't think that's a good idea"
24563,Carol, Excuse me
24564,Connor, Thank you. You're aware that it wasn't an accident. Any rookie fireman could tell you that
24565,Carol," What are you, the press?"
24566,Connor, Not exactly. So 12 council members are dead. You're the mayor. Why weren't you at that meeting?
24567,Carol, It wasn't official town business
24568,Connor, What was it then?
24569,Tyler, Mom? What's going on?
24570,Tyler, Is there something I can help you with?
24571,Connor, Maybe. How you doing? I'm Connor
24572,Carol," Tyler! Oh, my God!"
24573,Carol," Tyler, run!"
24574,Caroline, Please tell me that's the last one
24575,Stefan," These were specially carved. The length, the width. If you were a normal vampire, you would be dead"
24576,Tyler, This guy knew what he was doing. His gloves must have been steeped in vervain. He was looking for a vampire and he didn't hesitate for a second when he found one
24577,Stefan, These etchings...
24578,Caroline, Are the b*ll*ts spelled?
24579,Stefan, I don't know. They're something
24580,Matt," How are you feeling? You look a little, uh, strong out"
24581,Elena," I'm fine. It's just my emotions are all over the place. Everything's heightened. I mean, just the sight of all the names of the dead makes me want to cry for a week"
24582,Matt, You didn't have to volunteer
24583,Elena," People died. People we've known our whole lives. So... Yeah, I did"
24584,Elena, Is that…?
24585,Matt," April Young, yeah"
24586,Elena," Oh, wow"
24587,Elena, Hey there
24588,April," Hey. Long time, no see. Not since..."
24589,Elena, My parents' funeral
24590,April, Yeah
24591,Elena, Are you going to survive this?
24592,April," They want me to speak. I guess all the kids who lost somebody can. What am I supposed to say? ""I'm sorry my dad didn't fix the gas line."" But if I don't say anything, then... I mean, what if nobody does? I mean, my dad and I didn't always get along or anything, but everybody still deserves to have nice things said about them at their own funeral, you know? I mean, for my mom's funeral, everybody said some really nice things. I..."
24593,Elena, You say what you want to say. Or you don't say anything at all. And don't worry about your dad. Everyone in this town loved him
24594,April, Yeah. Until 2 days ago
24595,Elena, Even still
24596,Elena," I'm sorry, I... I have to go"
24597,Stefan," Bonnie? Bonnie, I know you're in there. I can hear you breathing. Bonnie, please, it's important"
24598,Stefan, Hey. Are you alright?
24599,Stefan," Can I come in, please?"
24600,Stefan, Hey. Hey
24601,Bonnie," My grams, it was like she was dying all over again. Just because I didn't listen to her about not doing black magic"
24602,Stefan," Well, you're dealing with the other side. It's not reliable. Witches were probably just messing with your head, trying to teach you a lesson"
24603,Bonnie," Well, it worked. I tried to do a basic nature spell this morning just to clear my head, and... It just brought it all back. Like it was happening all over again. I'm sorry. I'm a mess. I've been holed up in here, avoiding everyone. I've completely blown off Jamie. You came here 'cause you needed something, right?"
24604,Stefan, Yeah. But it can wait
24605,Bonnie," Oh, come on, Stefan, I'm ok. Come on. You're not exactly a drop by kind of guy. If something's wrong, tell me"
24606,Stefan, All right
24607,Stefan," these burns to the touch. Could just be steeped in vervain, but this writing--have you ever seen anything like this before?"
24608,Bonnie," No, it's not magical writing, if that's what you're thinking. Where'd you get these?"
24609,Stefan, I think we have a new vampire hunter in town
24610,Bonnie, Hmm. That's bad timing
24611,Damon," I'm here, I'm here. Where are you?"
24612,Elena, I'm in the basement bathroom
24613,Elena, Is that you at the door?
24614,Damon, Not yet
24615,Elena," I'm sorry, there's someone in here. Damon, hurry"
24616,Damon, You again. Stalking small town funerals?
24617,Elena," Oh, Damon. Thank god"
24618,Elena," Sorry, I spilled coffee all over my dress"
24619,Connor, We have not met. I'm Connor. Jordan
24620,Damon, Damon. Germaphobe. Everything ok in there?
24621,Elena, Just a minute!
24622,Damon, So what brings you to Mystic Falls? Bible salesman?
24623,Connor," No, no, actually I'm in, uh, environmental clean-up"
24624,Damon, Oh
24625,Connor, Heard you had a bit of a pollution problem
24626,Damon," Huh. Well, I was unaware. I breathe pretty easy"
24627,Elena, I'm so sorry that took so long
24628,Connor, No problem
24629,Damon," Well, enjoy your stay. We love visitors, and the scenery is to die for"
24630,Damon, Funeral parlor. Too soon. Sorry
24631,April," Sorry, you scared me. I was just practicing my speech for later"
24632,Elena, Did you bring the bl*od bag?
24633,Damon, Do you want to say that a little louder?
24634,Damon, Elena!
24635,Elena," No, I can't. It tastes like... What's wrong with me?"
24636,Damon," I don't know. Maybe it's your doppelganger bl*od, you're rejecting the transition"
24637,Elena," I'm dying, aren't I?"
24638,Damon," No, you're not dying. You just need to drink from the vein"
24639,Elena," No. No, no. I can't risk k*ll anyone, Damon. Maybe I'm better off dead"
24640,Damon," Don't even think like that, Elena. You'll be fine. Ok?"
24641,Elena, I have to get back inside
24642,Damon," Oh, great"
24643,Stefan," What's in the bag, Damon?"
24644,Damon," Mid-service snack. Church always gets me hungry. The whole bl*od of Christ thing, you know. I brought it for Elena"
24645,Stefan, You're really that intent on having your way?
24646,Damon," It's not my way, it's the only way"
24647,Stefan," If she hurts someone, she'll be desperate to turn the guilt off. Maybe even desperate enough to shut off her humanity"
24648,Damon," What, and become a ripper?"
24649,Stefan, We can't let her be anything like me
24650,Damon," Or God forbid she's anything like me. That's really what you're thinking. She's going to go off the rails eventually anyway, Stefan. So the faster we can make it happen, the sooner we can get her back on track"
24651,Stefan," She's strong. If we help her, she can survive"
24652,Damon," She's starving, Stefan. She hasn't been able to keep bl*od down for days"
24653,Stefan, What are you talking about? She told me she was fine
24654,Damon," Well, she lied. Your four-legged protein shake was a bust. The juice box was a no-go. She can't even keep my bl*od down"
24655,Stefan, She drank from you?
24656,Damon, Oops. Did I say that out loud?
24657,Matt, are you okay?
24658,Elena, I'm fine
24659,Jeremy," Hey, April was looking for you. She wanted help with her speech"
24660,Elena, Oh. Where is she?
24661,Jeremy, I don't know
24662,Stefan," What are you doing here, Tyler?"
24663,Tyler, Being sensitive to the community's loss
24664,Stefan, Hmm. With a hunter out to get you?
24665,Tyler, I'm not letting a hunter stop me from where I'm supposed to be
24666,Caroline," Also, if he shows his face, I'm going to kick his ass"
24667,Carol," Before we begin the mass, we'd like to open the floor to anyone who would like to store a memory about our late friends on the town council. I know that April Young wanted to say a few words about her dad. April?"
24668,Carol," April? Are you still here, honey?"
24669,Carol, Is there anyone else who would like to share a recollection or a memory about Pastor Young?
24670,Carol," Come on up, Elena"
24671,Damon, Don't know why that always makes me smile
24672,Damon, She doesn't look so good
24673,Stefan, Maybe you should have told me she was rejecting all food sources
24674,Damon," Jealousy's beneath you, brother"
24675,Stefan," Oh, bite me"
24676,Elena," I, um, when I talked to April earlier, she was kind of nervous about coming up to speak, and... Now that I'm up here, I'm kind of nervous, too. The worst day of loving someone is the day that you lose them"
24677,Caroline, Do you smell that?
24678,Tyler, bl*od
24679,Damon, Nobody move. Don't turn around. It's a trap
24680,Elena," I, um..."
24681,Stefan," It's ok. It's ok. I got you, I got you"
24682,Pastor, Please turn to page 42 in your hymn book. Let us join together in song
24683,Elena," The bl*od. Stefan, the bl*od, I can smell it. There's so much"
24684,Stefan," It's all right. It's all right; just remember what we talked about. Focus, push back. Come on, you can do this"
24685,Matt, What's wrong with her?
24686,Stefan, She's hungry. She hasn't fed
24687,Matt, So get her out of here
24688,Stefan, We can't. There's somebody watching us
24689,Damon, I'm going to go rip his head off now
24690,Stefan," You do that, Damon, and you risk exposing all of us"
24691,Damon," Well, I think the risk will be slightly diminished when I, you know, rip his head off"
24692,Elena," Stefan, I'm losing it"
24693,Damon, You have 10 seconds before I go old-fashioned on the new guy
24694,Stefan," Don't do it, Damon, please"
24695,Damon," 3, 2, 1, bye"
24696,Matt," Wait, wait, wait, Elena. Feed from me"
24697,Matt, It's ok. Everyone will just think you're upset. Feed from me
24698,Matt, It's ok. You're ok
24699,Elena, Thank you
24700,Elena," The bl*od, there's so much. It's got to be April. We have to help her"
24701,Stefan," Elena, we can't risk it"
24702,Elena, Then I'm going to do it
24703,Tyler, Excuse me. I just wanted to say a few words about Pastor Young
24704,Elena, What do we do?
24705,Tyler," Back in first grade, I was a brat who couldn't be bothered with team sports. Didn't care much about anything that didn't affect me. But he was the one who made me understand how important it is to be part of a team; a community. Of giving yourself up for the sake of…"
24706,Tyler, I'm going to k*ll that bastard
24707,Stefan," Damon's way ahead of you. Stay here, I have to help him"
24708,Elena, What about April?
24709,Caroline," I got it, go"
24710,Carol, I have to call an ambulance
24711,Caroline," No, he's fine!"
24712,Carol, The whole town just watched you get sh*t. I'm calling an ambulance
24713,Caroline, Elena?
24714,Stefan, Damon?
24715,Damon, What the hell was that for?
24716,Stefan, You know what
24717,Elena, April!
24718,Caroline," She's not dead, but if you feed on her, you will k*ll her!"
24719,Elena, Let go of me!
24720,Caroline," Look at her! Look at her, Elena. It's April. April Young. She's not a warm body for you to feed on. She's your friend"
24721,Caroline," She's an orphan, just like you. And she's scared, just like you were"
24722,April," Please! Don't hurt me, please!"
24723,Caroline, No one's going to hurt you. No one's going to hurt you
24724,Caroline, She needs you. You can make her forget all of this
24725,April, Why did he do this?
24726,Elena," No, I…I can't, Caroline, you have to do it"
24727,Caroline," No, the only way you're going to learn is if you do it yourself"
24728,Elena," No, I can't…"
24729,Caroline," Yes, you can. You just need to believe what you're telling her"
24730,Elena," April, listen to me"
24731,Elena, Everything's going to be ok
24732,Elena," You're going to get through this, just like I got through it"
24733,Elena, And I'm going to help you. I promise
24734,April, I'm going to be okay. You're gonna help me
24735,Elena, You watched the funeral from up here so that you could grieve alone. It was a beautiful service. People said really nice things
24736,Matt, That was insane. How do you think they'll cover this one up?
24737,Jeremy, An assassination attempt on the mayor's son
24738,Matt, Altar boy goes postal
24739,Connor, Hey. What happened there?
24740,Matt, Girlfriend went a little overboard
24741,Jeremy, Nice ink
24742,Matt, What ink?
24743,Jeremy, You didn't see his tattoo? It was huge
24744,Matt, He didn't have a tattoo
24745,Jeremy," Yeah, he did"
24746,Pastor Young," ""Dear April, I'm sorry for what you're going through. What I did was a necessary sacrifice, and I'm afraid it's only the first of many more sacrifices to come. There's always been an evil that spread through Mystic Falls, but now a greater one is coming. My death is but the first in the w*r ahead. I will see you again when we all find our salvation. Until then, I love you. Dad."""
24747,Stefan, Helps with the cravings
24748,Elena, You're mad
24749,Stefan," Yeah, I'm mad. You lied to me"
24750,Elena," I didn't lie, I just didn't tell you…"
24751,Stefan," Come on, Elena, you lied to me"
24752,Elena," You were just so happy that things were going well, and…"
24753,Stefan, You think I'm happy?
24754,Elena, I just didn't want to ruin it for you
24755,Stefan," You're in hell, which means that I'm in hell. And then you go to Damon for help"
24756,Elena," Yeah, because I thought that he would understand"
24757,Stefan, You think I don't?
24758,Elena," Stefan, please…"
24759,Stefan," You fed on him, Elena. You fed on him. I know that may not mean much to you, but it means a lot to me. And I know it certainly meant a lot to Damon"
24760,Elena," I didn't want to hurt you. I'm…I'm sorry. Look, I'm really, really sorry, I..."
24761,Elena, Why am I crying? I am so sick of crying
24762,Stefan, Your emotions are a bit heightened right now
24763,Elena," I feel like I've been crying since the day that my parents died. My life is...It's like a never ending funeral. We keep burying people, Stefan. You want to know what's heightened? It's grief. I can't stop feeling everyone's grief. All the hurt, I feel like it's trying to explode out of me"
24764,Stefan, Hey. Hey. Come on. Come with me
24765,Elena, Where?
24766,Stefan, Something we need to do
24767,Damon, What are we doing here?
24768,Bonnie, I don't know
24769,Bonnie, Ask Stefan
24770,Damon," Stefan, What are we doing?"
24771,Stefan," We're finishing the memorial we didn't get to have earlier. We need to start healing, Damon. We've all lost so much, especially recently. I think we're numb to it. We push it away, we make a joke out of it, ignore how we feel. Time to just let ourselves grieve"
24772,Damon, So you're lighting lanterns
24773,Stefan," Yeah, yeah. We need to do this"
24774,Damon, What we need to do is find out who this hunter is and what he knows about the death of the council. We have more important things to be doing right now than this
24775,Stefan," Not tonight, we don't. This is for my Uncle Zach. My friend Lexi. For Alaric"
24776,Matt, This is for Vickie
24777,Caroline, This is for my dad. And Tyler's
24778,Jeremy," This is for our parents, for Vickie... Anna, Jenna. And Alaric"
24779,Damon, No way. I'm not doing that
24780,Bonnie, This is for my grams
24781,Elena," This, um... Is for my mom, my dad and Jenna… Everyone that we've all lost; everyone that this town has lost. And for me. I guess"
24782,Damon," They're floating lanterns in the sky. Can you believe that? Japanese lantern is a symbol of letting go of the past. Well, here's a newsflash… we're not Japanese. You know what they are? Children. Like lighting a candle's going to make everything ok. Or even saying a prayer, or pretending Elena is not going to end up just like the rest of us m*rder vampires. Stupid, delusional, exasperating little children. I know what you're going to say. It makes them feel better, Damon. So what? For how long? A minute? A day? What difference does it make?"
24783,Damon," Because in the end, when you lose somebody, every candle, every prayer is not going to make up for the fact that the only thing that you have left is a hole in your life where that somebody that you cared about used to be. And a rock. With a birthday carved into it that I'm pretty sure is wrong. Ahhh. So, thanks, friend. Thanks for leaving me here to baby-sit. Because I should be long gone by now. I didn't get the girl. Remember? I'm just stuck here fighting with my brother and taking care of the kids. You owe me big"
24784,Alaric," I miss you, too, buddy"
24785,Connor, Don't bother. It's a paralytic
24786,Damon," Good day for a midlife crisis. 164 years, I'd say you're due"
24787,Stefan, Elena's transition to vampire has been a little depressing. I'm gonna help her have some fun
24788,Damon," Oh. Those who can't, teach"
24789,Stefan," Oh, I see we're still fighting. Got it. Where you going?"
24790,Damon," That hunter jacked Tyler Lockwood of his werewolf venom last night, so basically he's got vampire poison in a bottle, and I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna eat him"
24791,Stefan, I'll go with you
24792,Damon, I don't want your help. I just wanna k*ll this guy and get the hell out of town
24793,Damon, Isn't that the deal? Whoever Elena doesn't choose leaves?
24794,Stefan, That was before she turned
24795,Damon," And I stayed to help, but I take you punching me as the first clue... I'm not wanted here anymore"
24796,Stefan," Listen, you blood-shared with my girlfriend, and I punched you in the face. You deserved it. Why don't you stop being dramatic?"
24797,Damon," No, brother. Dramatic would be leaving before I k*ll this hunter"
24798,Matt, Kind of weird doing this in our old make-out spot
24799,Elena, Thank you for doing this. I can't keep anything else down
24800,Matt," It's ok. I kind of owe you my life, remember?"
24801,Elena," Yeah, but I didn't make Stefan save your life so that I could turn you into a human bl*od bank"
24802,Matt," Elena, please just let me do this for you"
24803,Matt, Is that enough?
24804,Elena, No. but if I had any more I'm afraid I wouldn't stop
24805,Elena, Here
24806,Elena, Thank you
24807,Matt, So you really think school is the best place for you right now?
24808,Elena," The vampire hunter knows that Damon's a vampire and that I know Damon. Hiding at home would be more suspicious. Besides, I want to be here. It's my senior year. I survived this long. There's no way I'm bailing before graduation"
24809,Elena, Town called for curfew?
24810,Matt, Tyler got sh*t in front of half the town. Everyone's a little freaked
24811,Elena, If only they knew the real story
24812,Tyler, Who the hell are you two?
24813,Carol," Tyler, it's ok. They're here for your protection"
24814,Tyler, More deputies?
24815,Klaus," Not exactly. They're hybrids. I was halfway to Chicago when I heard you were attacked. I had hoped to leave Mystic Falls for good, but duty calls"
24816,Tyler, Nice to know you care
24817,Klaus," I don't. I should have k*ll you for the little stunt you and your friends pulled... stopping my heart, leaving me in a coffin to rot"
24818,Tyler," Yeah, well, you used my body as an escape hatch, then kissed my girlfriend, so maybe we're even"
24819,Klaus," Not even close. But you hybrids are a dying breed. I can't make more of you, and I won't have anyone taking liberties with the ones I have left. Consider them your new bodyguards"
24820,Stefan, So first time we've been back in Alaric's classroom
24821,Elena," The first period, and I'm ready to bawl my eyes out"
24822,Rebekah," Morning, everyone"
24823,Elena," And just like that, I'm no longer feeling sentimental"
24824,Rebekah," So I'm throwing a little anti-curfew party at my new house... starts in the fifth period, goes to whenever. Spread the word"
24825,Rebekah," You're welcome to join, Elena, if you'd like to bury the hatchet"
24826,Elena, It's a pretty enormous hatchet
24827,Rebekah," Well, I'm feeling generous of spirit"
24828,Elena," New house, huh? Did your brother finally kick you out?"
24829,Rebekah, He didn't kick me out. I left
24830,Elena, So you left the only person on earth that actually likes you?
24831,Rebekah," Well, your boyfriend liked me once. Actually, a lot more than once"
24832,Stefan," Why are you still in town, Rebekah? Don't you have anywhere else to go?"
24833,Rebekah," Well, history's my favorite class. Actually, where is Mr. Saltzman? Oh, that's right"
24834,Rebekah, I k*ll him
24835,Stefan, Just breathe. Just breathe. You haven't felt this kind of rage before
24836,Elena," I hate her. I didn't think I was capable of hate, but I hate her and hate that I hate her"
24837,Elena, That's the hunter
24838,Stefan, What the hell is he doing here?
24839,Elena, Jeremy. No
24840,Stefan," No, no, no. Hey. You get this, okay?"
24841,Stefan, I got that
24842,Girl, There you are. Rebekah sent me to see if you were ok
24843,Elena," I'm fine, Heather"
24844,Heather, I'm not
24845,Rebekah," What's wrong, Elena? Getting hungry?"
24846,Elena," No, g-get away from me"
24847,Rebekah, But she's so delicious
24848,Elena," You shouldn't be here. This is my school. It's my life, and I'm not gonna let you ruin it"
24849,Rebekah," It's my school now, my life. Maybe you're the one who shouldn't be here. And I couldn't help but overhear that there's a vampire hunter roaming the hallways"
24850,Rebekah, See you in gym. I think its dodge ball day
24851,Jeremy," You mind telling me who you are and why I'm here? I'm happy to miss bio, but..."
24852,Connor, I looked into your family's history. You and your sister have been through quite a lot
24853,Jeremy," What are you, a social worker? Why do you care?"
24854,Connor, Because you saw this
24855,Jeremy," Mm, it's a tattoo. Big deal"
24856,Connor," No, I call this a hunter's mark, as in vampire hunter"
24857,Jeremy," Uh, a vampire hunter? Heh. Look, I'm sorry, man, but..."
24858,Connor," Jeremy, I know your family's history in this town, so you playing dumb just make you look dumb"
24859,Jeremy, Why the show and tell? I don't even know you
24860,Connor," Because it's invisible to anyone but another hunter or potential hunter. Find me a vampire. I'll train you; teach you how to do what I do. I'm on Hudson, off route 13. Don't show up unless you find one"
24861,Jeremy," Well, how am I supposed to do that?"
24862,Connor, Why don't you start by asking your friend with the bandage on his neck?
24863,Damon, Um... Yeah
24864,Caroline, It was a valiant first-day effort. No one will judge you if you want to go home
24865,Elena, I don't want to go home. I want to take the white-oak stake and k*ll her. That's how mad I am. She made me m*rder
24866,Stefan, How about we just leave the m*rder to Damon?
24867,Elena, And... And then do what? Ignore her to death?
24868,Stefan," Look, she's trying to make herself feel better. She knows that everybody hates her, so she's trying to hate harder. Tell you what. Let's just skip the rest of the day, go have some fun. I feel like this day is severely lacking in fun"
24869,Elena," Yeah. Ok, fine. We'll go to her party and show her that she can't intimidate me. I just have to go home and change first"
24870,Caroline, Does she seem a little off-balance to you?
24871,Stefan," Yeah. She's channeling all her emotions into rage. Makes her feel like she has purpose. I used to do that, too, when I was, you know..."
24872,Caroline, Ripper you?
24873,Stefan," Yeah. She needs to come to terms with it, confront it, let it in before she can let it go"
24874,Caroline," You're good at this. You know that? You saved my vampire life. Now you're saving hers. You should write a book, go on ""the view."""
24875,Haley," So this is where you've been hiding, huh?"
24876,Tyler, Haley?
24877,Haley," Hey, Hey, Lockwoof"
24878,Haley, Ass. I thought Klaus k*ll you
24879,Tyler, I should have called
24880,Haley, From your trailer park in Florida. You liar! You're totally loaded
24881,Tyler, Uh…
24882,Haley, I chained you up all over the Appalachians. I talked you through every turn. I helped you break the sire bond. You could have told me your real story
24883,Tyler," I didn't want anybody to follow me back. Werewolves weren't safe around Klaus, and you shouldn't be here either. His hybrids are all over this house and so is he"
24884,Haley," I know. One of his hybrids is with a pack I ran with. He called me and told me that he was coming to protect a guy named Tyler, and I thought, ""What are the chances?"""
24885,Haley," Well, the least you could do is pour me some fancy, rich-people scotch"
24886,Tyler, Sure. Of course
24887,Meredith, Why were you being so cryptic?
24888,Damon, Come in. Close the door
24889,Meredith, Tell me that is not a b*mb
24890,Damon, Ok. It's a kitten. It's an adorable exploding kitten
24891,Meredith, Why didn't you call your brother?
24892,Damon," Because I'm proud and stubborn and... Oh, look. You're already here. Come on. You're not gonna get hurt. All I need you to do is be doctorly, cut out the arrow. I'd do it myself, but if I move... Psssh!"
24893,Meredith, Okay
24894,Damon, So how well did you know pastor Young?
24895,Meredith, He was a patient of mine. He was always a nice guy
24896,Damon, Nice crazy guy. He wrote a letter about sacrifice and w*r brewing in Mystic Falls
24897,Meredith," What does he mean, ""a greater evil is coming""? I mean, we have great enough evil already"
24898,Damon, You'd think
24899,Meredith, How'd you get stuck on hunter duty?
24900,Damon, Stefan had a physics test
24901,Meredith, You're a good brother
24902,Damon, I'm the bad brother
24903,Meredith," You're strung up to a b*mb while Stefan plays vampire with a girl who broke your heart, but you are doing a very good job of acting like it doesn't suck. Ok, I think that should be good"
24904,Rebekah," Hey, Matt. So I'm having a little party. You should, uh, ditch last period and come"
24905,Rebekah," Look, I know you're still angry I ran you off the bridge, but you have to understand Alaric k*ll my brother. He was trying to k*ll me. I had to do something to stop him. I never wanted to hurt you"
24906,Connor, What'd you say last time? Hickeys?
24907,Connor, Kinky girlfriend. Who are you letting feed on you?
24908,Matt, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know where I got that
24909,Connor, Sure about that?
24910,Connor, Tell me which one of your High School friends is a bloodsucker
24911,Matt, It's... Rebekah. Rebekah Mikaelson
24912,Connor," Thank you. When you wake up, she'll be long gone"
24913,Damon, Hope you plan on cleaning this up
24914,Elena, I need bourbon to get through Rebekah's party. Yours is better than Stefan's
24915,Damon, Oh. Top drawer in the dresser
24916,Elena, Thanks
24917,Elena, You keep alcohol in your underwear drawer?
24918,Damon," No. You weren't looking for alcohol, were you? Do you think I'd actually leave the last remaining white oak stake where any vampire could just walk in and take it?"
24919,Elena, What happened to you?
24920,Damon, Hunter mishap
24921,Elena, You know he was at my school today?
24922,Damon, Yep. Jeremy told me
24923,Elena, Why were you talking to Jeremy?
24924,Damon, Don't worry about it
24925,Elena," Damon, don't bring him into this"
24926,Damon," Perish the thought he might actually be useful, Elena"
24927,Damon," You staying for the show, or..."
24928,Elena, I'm finding that stake
24929,Connor, You got a vampire for me?
24930,Jeremy," No, but I know where you can find one. There's a doctor, Meredith Fell, she uses vampire bl*od in surgery. I think she has a deal with one, her bl*od for his"
24931,Connor," You see, that's the problem. When a town protects one vampire, word spreads. More come. They feed. They turn. Soon you got a full-on infestation. Your High School, for example, is crawling with 'em. One's even throwing a party"
24932,Jeremy, Is that where we're going?
24933,Connor," Nah, we're going to the hospital. As long as people are drinking at that High School party, I got it covered. They'll be dead by sundown"
24934,Stefan, Wow. We didn't have to be invited in. I wonder who used to live here
24935,Elena, Or who died here
24936,Stefan, You're fixating
24937,Elena," No, I'm just quietly hating"
24938,Stefan, This is mine now
24939,Stefan, Thank you
24940,Stefan, Why don't you have a drink? It'll help you let go
24941,Elena, April's here. I'm gonna go say hi
24942,Stefan, And I am gonna find something a little stronger than beer
24943,Elena, Okay
24944,Caroline, I ditched Rebekah's ditching party
24945,Caroline, What's with all the testosterone?
24946,Tyler, Hybrids. I'm on house arrest
24947,Caroline, Says who? Your mom? Come on. Sneak out
24948,Tyler," Not my mom, Caroline"
24949,Caroline, You're kidding me. Klaus?
24950,Klaus, You're a new face
24951,Haley, And I take it from your accent you're an old one. Klaus
24952,Klaus," My reputation precedes me, hopefully not all bad"
24953,Haley," A little bad, mostly repulsive"
24954,Klaus, So you're a friend of Tyler's. That's strange. He's never mentioned you
24955,Tyler, You should go the party. I'll be fine here
24956,Caroline, But I'd rather hang with you
24957,Tyler, Trust me. I am no fun right now
24958,Klaus, And I think I know why
24959,Elena, Hey
24960,April, Elena. Thank God I know someone
24961,Elena, I'm glad you came. Are you thirsty?
24962,April," You know, you used to read me bedtime stories"
24963,Elena, And now I'm giving you beer. Sounds about right
24964,April, If my dad could see me now
24965,Elena, How are you... Doing with everything?
24966,April," I'm trudging through my denial phase... Dreaming up conspiracy theories. My first weekend home from boarding school, my dad smelt cigarette smoke on my clothes before I even walked in the door. He would have noticed a gas leak in the house"
24967,Elena, So you... you don't think that it was an accident?
24968,April," I know there's no investigation, that everyone's calling it an accident, but the sh**ting at the church, it just feels like..."
24969,Rebekah," like something wicked this way comes. I know, right? It's like this town's cursed or something"
24970,Elena," Hey, April, why don't you go look around the house, and I'll find you in a little bit"
24971,April, Okay
24972,Rebekah, Did I forget to uninvited you?
24973,Elena, Did you blow up her dad's house to get revenge on the council?
24974,Rebekah," I don't give a damn about some dodgy middle-aged council. You come into my house, throw around false accusations, and then you have the nerve to drink my beer?"
24975,Elena, My ring
24976,Elena, Give it back!
24977,Rebekah, Get it yourself
24978,Elena, No!
24979,Stefan, Damon give that to you?
24980,Elena," Yes, reluctantly. Stefan, she's…She's just gonna keep pushing and pushing. "
24981,Stefan," Well, if you want to k*ll her, I'm not gonna stop you. But, see, here's what'll happen. It'll feel really good for about 10 seconds, and then after that, tens and thousands of vampires all over the world will start to die. Every vampire she ever turned will die. See, rage is a really powerful feeling... But guilt... Take it from me... It'll destroy you. So you can either go after her, or you can get on the back of my motorcycle... And we can get the hell out of here"
24982,Rebekah, Leaving so soon?
24983,Elena, No. not just yet. I never got a drink
24984,Elena, Now I'm ready to go
24985,Rebekah, What in the hell?
24986,Klaus," She's quite fetching, that Hayley"
24987,Tyler, Where is she?
24988,Klaus," Oh, she had to run, but don't worry. I had her take the back door so Caroline wouldn't see"
24989,Tyler, Whatever you think you know...
24990,Klaus," I don't know anything, but I've put together a pretty convincing picture. Why don't you tell me where my imagination deviates from reality? You went off to the Appalachians to break my sire bond. There, you met a pack of werewolves, begged them for help. Among them was a girl. She was gorgeous, with the same animal instincts as you. Emotions ran high. Inhibitions ran low"
24991,Tyler, Stop it
24992,Klaus," Then, in a moment of weakness, the thick sexual tension became something much more real"
24993,Tyler, I said stop!
24994,Klaus, And Caroline has no idea
24995,Klaus," Hello, Damon"
24996,Damon," Klaus, where's Tyler?"
24997,Klaus, Tyler's otherwise occupied making big decisions about honesty and what not. Is there anything I can do?
24998,Damon," I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join..."
24999,Klaus," He wouldn't. I, however..."
25000,Jeremy, That's her
25001,Connor, Stay here
25002,Connor, Is a hospital really the best place for a germophobe?
25003,Damon, Did I say that I was a germophobe? Pfft. Sorry. I meant vampire
25004,Damon," Stings, doesn't it?"
25005,Klaus," Hello, mate"
25006,Elena, No!
25007,Stefan, Are you okay?
25008,Elena, Stefan. What's wrong with me?
25009,Stefan, Damon said the hunter had werewolf venom
25010,Elena, Oh my god
25011,Matt, You don't look so hot
25012,Rebekah," Whatever it is, it's not the white-oak stake, so it can't k*ll me. I'm surprised you came to my party"
25013,Matt," Well, I thought about it. You explained why you ran me off the bridge, so least I could do is explain how I feel. The truth is, Rebekah, I think you're amazing. You've had a thousand years to learn, to grow, and to start fresh... And somehow you've managed to throw it all away. Now you're alone. You're compelling your friends. Your brother hates you. You whine about not finding love. The reason you don't find love is because you don't deserve it"
25014,Damon," Keep it up, buddy. We'll be scraping you off the ceiling"
25015,Connor, You two are gonna k*ll me anyway
25016,Klaus," Well, let's not be too hasty. I feel like we're just getting to know each other"
25017,Damon," Start with the basics. Where are you from? What do you know? Maybe you can cue me in on this greater evil, because I've fought this guy, and there's nothing more evil than that"
25018,Klaus," Yeah, truth be told, I'm as evil as it gets"
25019,Connor," I'm not telling you anything. You think if you k*ll me, it's gonna be over? There's another waiting to take my place"
25020,Damon," See, this is what I like to hear... Vague threats, ominous prophecies, disappearing tattoos"
25021,Klaus," What do you mean, ""tattoos""?"
25022,Damon, Don't bother. You can't see the damn thing
25023,Klaus," There's more to you than meets the eye, isn't there?"
25024,Klaus," Nice try, but I'm faster than your average vampire."
25025,Klaus, You're one of the five
25026,Damon, The what?
25027,Connor, I'm faster than the average hunter
25028,Stefan," Klaus, where the hell are you?"
25029,Elena, Why am I thinking about you?
25030,Damon, Because you're a vampire now... And part of you knows you're a lot more like me than you are like him
25031,Stefan, You came
25032,Klaus," I did. And for future reference, one voice-mail is just as effective as 9"
25033,Klaus," What's wrong, love?"
25034,Stefan," She has werewolf venom in her system. You know you're the only one that can heal her, Klaus. Please"
25035,Klaus," And what would you have done if I were no longer here? Hmm? If you and your friends had succeeded in ridding the world of me? Let's play that game for a moment, shall we?"
25036,Stefan, Whatever you want from me...
25037,Klaus," I don't want anything from you. Her, on the other hand..."
25038,Klaus," If you had told me a few hours ago, I wouldn't have cared a lick about her dying. But as it turns out... You may be of use to me after all"
25039,Klaus, Here we go
25040,April, Hey. Way to bail on your own party
25041,Rebekah, I just... I needed a minute. Did everyone leave?
25042,April," Yeah, deputies weren't actually super happy about the anti-curfew party"
25043,Rebekah, Why are you still here?
25044,April," Um, honestly? Um, picking up trash is a hell of a lot better than sitting at home alone, thinking about the family I no longer have"
25045,Rebekah," Hey, uh, if you want, I could, uh... I could help you look into what happened with the fire at your farmhouse"
25046,April, Heh. What are you gonna be able to do that I can't?
25047,Rebekah, You'd be surprised
25048,Carol, So the sn*per was inside?
25049,Damon," Yep. Still is, in tiny, little pieces"
25050,Carol, Good. I'll cancel the curfew and call off the extra patrols. I can't say I approve of your methods
25051,Damon," I'll make a donation. They'll name a wing after me, maybe"
25052,Jeremy, See? I told you I could be a badass
25053,Damon, Shh. Badasses don't say that
25054,Damon, Doc. Nice job
25055,Meredith, You told me the plan was to lead him to the storage room
25056,Damon, We did. Congrats
25057,Meredith," You left out the part about blowing up a hospital, with patients who are sick and fragile and who don't need things exploding down the hall from them"
25058,Damon," It was contained. Nobody got hurt. Come on. Buy me a farewell drink. We'll talk about what the hell Klaus meant by ""the five."""
25059,Meredith," You know you're not going anywhere, Damon, and I am not your new partner in vampire crime. Fix things with Stefan and Elena. Don't let your pride leave you all alone"
25060,Caroline, Hey
25061,Stefan, Hey. Thanks for coming
25062,Caroline, Not every day I get summoned by a Salvatore. So what's up?
25063,Stefan, Do you remember what you were like before you turned?
25064,Caroline," Mm, you mean an insecure control freak?"
25065,Stefan," You grew into yourself when you became a vampire. You changed. And Elena, she's changing, too. And I want her to be able to enjoy it without all the guilt and shame that I went through. And there was a moment today when she did. And when I'm with her, every bone in my body tells me to join her, to enjoy it. But I know that if I do, even a little... I risk becoming him. The ripper. I love her, and I don't want to hold her back"
25066,Caroline, But you don't know how to be around her and still resist that urge
25067,Stefan," Damon promised he'd help me stay off the edge, but, uh, he and I, we're not in a very good place right now, not when it comes to her. I just thought you're so good at it, at being a vampire"
25068,Caroline," Because of you, Stefan. I'm good at it because of you. Come to me whenever you want, and I won't let you lose control"
25069,Matt," Elena! If I'd known you were gonna go to that party, I never would have told Connor about Rebekah"
25070,Elena," I already had this conversation with Jeremy. There's no way you guys could have known that I would go. I mean, I was surprised that I went. Stefan warned me that I would feel things more powerfully, but, Matt, the hatred that I felt today... I almost... I almost k*ll her in front of everyone, in the middle of a party. That's not me. Or at least, it didn't... didn't use to be"
25071,Matt," Honestly, Elena, Rebekah kind of deserves it"
25072,Elena," Yeah, but it's not just about Rebekah. It's about my mind. I'm having these terrible thoughts, these... Violent images, and I... it's all driven by one simple thing, this hunger"
25073,Matt," Hey, Elena, you sure you wanna take that much?"
25074,Matt," Elena. Elena, that hurts. Elena. Elena. Ele..."
25075,Matt, Elena! Elena
25076,Damon, Stop. Stop
25077,Elena," Oh my god. Matt, I'm sorry. I'm so... I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean to"
25078,Damon, It's okay
25079,Damon," Forget what just happened. You came over, she fed a little bit, and you left. Now go home"
25080,Elena, What have I done?
25081,Damon, Nothing you should be ashamed of. You are a vampire now. You just have to learn the right way to be one. And I'm gonna teach you
25082,Connor, You saved me?
25083,Klaus, Congratulations. You just became worth more to me alive than dead
25084,Connor, what... what did you mean when you said I was one of the five?
25085,Klaus," You don't know your own history? Well, let's just say it's made you the most well protected vampire hunter in town"
25086,Stefan, So what is all this?
25087,Damon, Some personal items that I snaked from the vampire hunter's rv. May he rest in peace. I'm searching for a supernatural handbook
25088,Stefan, You know for a fact he was supernatural?
25089,Damon," Definitely wasn't natural. The guy magically appears just as someone blows up the entire founders' council, covered in a tattoo that only Jeremy Gilbert, of all people in the world, seems to be able to see. Klaus mentioned something about him being one of the five. And then he kamikazes himself with expl*sives. Seem natural to you?"
25090,Stefan, What's the five?
25091,Damon, That's what I'm hoping is in the first chapter of the handbook
25092,Damon," Liz Forbes, my favorite sheriff. What? That's... Concerning. Keep me posted"
25093,Stefan," What, you're not going to tell me?"
25094,Damon, I can't tell you. It's private. We're in a fight
25095,Stefan, You're in a fight; I'm not in a fight. I'm over it. I've been over it
25096,Damon, You're not still mad at me about Elena?
25097,Stefan, You let her feed on you. I'm always going to be mad at you. But we're not in a fight
25098,Damon," Very well, then. They didn't find any remains at the expl*si*n site"
25099,Stefan, So Connor's still out there
25100,Damon, Apparently so. I'm going to need you to get on this today. I have to take Elena to college
25101,Stefan," I'm sorry, you have to do what, exactly?"
25102,Damon," I'm teaching her how to feed. She needs to learn snatch, eat, erase now more than ever. Ah. We're not in a fight, remember?"
25103,Elena," I know it's crazy, but I almost k*ll Matt last night. Damon had to rip me off of him and then compel him to forget. Call it doppelganger curse or whatever, but I can't drink animal bl*od. I can't drink from a bl*od bag. I can only drink from the vein"
25104,Stefan, A little slow. Almost got you
25105,Elena, That's why we're not using the wood ones for hunter defense class
25106,Stefan, What about Caroline? She's a genius at self-control
25107,Elena," She's too good. She doesn't understand how hard it is. And you, well, I know what being around too much bl*od does to you, so... I can't put you through that"
25108,Stefan," Hmm. So I guess that leaves Damon, huh?"
25109,Elena, Don't be jealous. You know I wish it could be you
25110,Stefan, Fine. You wish it could be me
25111,Elena, We're crashing Bonnie's trip to Whitmore College. The Professor that took over her gram's classes? He invited her. Listen to me. You're the one who's getting me through this. No matter who teaches me how to feed
25112,Stefan," All right. Just be careful, ok? The bl*od, the feed... It's easy to get caught up in it"
25113,Elena, I will. I promise
25114,Matt, What's that?
25115,Rebekah," The key to your new truck. It's parked outside, paid for, insured, everything but a big red bow"
25116,Matt, If that's your idea of an apology... You should probably give it to Elena. She's the one you k*ll
25117,Klaus, You're trying too hard
25118,Rebekah," Last I heard, you were leaving town... forever"
25119,Klaus," Well, I was. But then I thought to myself, how can I when my sister, clearly so desperate for love and affection, is left here... Bribing the help"
25120,Rebekah," What do you want, Nik? I thought I was dead to you"
25121,Klaus," Things change, Rebekah. I've stumbled upon something I think might be of interest to you"
25122,Rebekah, Doubt that
25123,Klaus," No? Well, what if I told you the brotherhood of the five still existed?"
25124,Rebekah, What?
25125,Klaus," You see? And like that, bygones. Come on, love. Work to do"
25126,Rebekah," We don't have anything to do. There is no ""we"". I don't care about the five, and I don't care about you"
25127,Klaus, As you wish
25128,Elena, Are you sure that you're okay with this?
25129,Bonnie," If I could spell you out of wanting bl*od, I would. But I can't, so better you doing this now than at freshman orientation"
25130,Elena, Something tells me that college isn't in my future anymore
25131,Damon," Oh, stop with the pity party. If I can go to college, you can go to college"
25132,Bonnie, You? Went to college?
25133,Damon, Sure. Plenty of times. I always had a thing for sorority girls
25134,Bonnie, You're disgusting
25135,Damon, I know
25136,Professor Shane," I say the word ""witch"", what pops into your head? Halloween costume? Villain of a fairy tale? Maybe an ex-girlfriend? Well, whatever image it is, it's probably not Tanielle Soso..."
25137,Elena, Is that him?
25138,Bonnie, Yeah
25139,Elena, He's kind of...
25140,Bonnie, Hot
25141,Professor Shane," I'm an admittedly crappy photographer. Now, in reality, or in this reality, at least, witches have appeared across every culture in history. They're the architects of the supernatural. Responsible for everything that goes bump in the night, from ghosts to vampires to doppelgangers..."
25142,Damon," What is this guy, witchipedia?"
25143,Bonnie," Shh, shut up"
25144,Professor Shane," Now, if you're a skeptic, you'd call that a coincidence. But if you're a true believer... You know what, there really isn't such thing"
25145,Elena, What if I'm... A ripper?
25146,Damon, You're not a ripper
25147,Elena, What if I am?
25148,Damon," Well, then, pick someone and we'll find out. Stoner guys are no good to grab. They're too paranoid and you don't want the extra buzz. Now, she is fun-sized. But too alert. Geeky girls are inherently suspicious of anyone who's nice to them. What you want is the little blonde, pretty girl. Self-absorbed, easily flattered. You just have to separate her from the pack and make your move"
25149,Professor Shane, Am I interrupting you guys? Or is it maybe the other way around?
25150,Damon, Sorry. I was just saying how much I love witches
25151,Professor Shane," Yeah, you and me both, brother. All right, listen, we should probably talk about the readings that none of you did"
25152,Klaus, Looks like I'll have to beef up the hybrid security detail
25153,Stefan," I was going to take him, but I figured you went through such trouble to truss him up in your red room of pain"
25154,Klaus, It's from the inquisition. I thought it was a nice touch
25155,Stefan, What'd you get out of him?
25156,Klaus, Not enough. He's mum about the council fire and he's not saying anything about this greater evil we're all supposed to be shivering over. What brings you snooping?
25157,Stefan," Well, I can't say it in front of him. As I'm sure you've figured out, our friend here can't be compelled"
25158,Klaus," You're full of mysteries, aren't you?"
25159,Connor," I told you, I don't know anything"
25160,Klaus," Thankfully, I know plenty. Shall we?"
25161,Klaus, So what's with the home invasion?
25162,Stefan, Damon said you knew something about this guy. I should have figured you were up to something when you healed Elena from the werewolf poison without asking for anything in return
25163,Klaus, I was feeling benevolent
25164,Stefan, You're never benevolent. Who is this guy? What's the five?
25165,Klaus, So many questions
25166,Stefan, It's a good thing I have nothing to do today except get answers out of you
25167,Klaus," Fine. You might actually be useful in persuading my sister to cooperate. The brotherhood of the five was a group of highly k*ll vampire hunters. We crossed paths with them in the twelfth century. Italy. My siblings and I had followed the Normans as they conquered the South. Feeding, turning people as we went"
25168,Hunter, These demons live among you. Passing as human
25169,Klaus (Voiceover), But with the bloodshed came exposure
25170,The hunter, So witness with your own eyes...
25171,Elijah, He's putting on quite the show
25172,Klaus, He's nothing. I could eat him for sport
25173,Elijah," Still, you should heed the warning. Between you here and Kol in the east, you have not been discreet. Stories of the original vampires are spreading"
25174,Klaus," If you're worried about discretion, perhaps you should wrangle our sister"
25175,Stefan, So these hunters have been around for 900 years?
25176,Klaus," Apparently. Well, our friend in the other room is the first I've seen since then. Kind of makes you wonder what they've been up to all these years"
25177,Stefan, And Rebekah had a thing with one of them?
25178,Klaus," Oh, she didn't just have a thing. She fell in love with him. He told her all his secrets. Which I will gladly share with you... Provided you do one thing for me"
25179,Stefan, And what's that?
25180,Klaus," Get Rebekah over here. She's being stubborn. And hateful. I need to make peace with her. I want her to give me some very important information about the hunter, which she won't do unless she believes we've made up"
25181,Stefan, And... What's in it for me?
25182,Klaus," Just get her here and I'll tell you. Oh, and Stefan... Trust me when I say this... that hunter in there holds the answer to all your prayers"
25183,Matt," Hey, April. Can I get you some more water?"
25184,April, I'm good. I'm not just sitting here alone like the loser new girl. I'm with my friend. She just...
25185,Rebekah, Sorry. Family drama
25186,Matt, You two are friends?
25187,Rebekah, Is it so hard to believe I would have one?
25188,Matt, Yeah. It is. And I'm keeping the truck
25189,Rebekah," Hey, off limits! I have dibs"
25190,Stefan, You won't remember any of this
25191,Stefan, Klaus wants me to fake peace with you so you'll talk about the five
25192,Rebekah," Yeah, I bet. Don't help him. He'll just betray you. It's what he does"
25193,Stefan," All right, well, forget him. Help me instead"
25194,Rebekah, Why? You hate me more than he does
25195,Stefan, Because I'm going to figure out what he's up to. And plus I can give you the one thing that he won't
25196,Rebekah, And what's that?
25197,Stefan," A clean slate. I'm not saying that I'm willing to forgive you for what you did to Elena, but I'm willing to set it aside and start over"
25198,Rebekah, Why would you do that?
25199,Stefan," Because you're obviously not leaving town any time soon, and I'm just looking for a way we can all get along. Plus, you can't be too happy wandering around school with no friends"
25200,Rebekah," Well, what if I don't care what you or anyone else thinks?"
25201,Stefan," Well, I'm pretty sure that you care what, uh, Matt over there thinks. So maybe I can talk to him about a clean slate, too"
25202,Damon, She's young and healthy; she'll heal up like a charm. Just keep your eye on the ball
25203,Elena," It's not a game, Damon"
25204,Damon," Fine, it's not a game; it's a high-stakes dangerous maneuver. Now, just go. Just like we practiced. That's all you have to do"
25205,Elena," Hey! You're in my anthro class, right?"
25206,Girl," Uh, yeah. I guess so"
25207,Elena," I, uh, totally spaced and forgot to get the reading list. Do you have it?"
25208,Girl, Sure. Let me check
25209,Elena, This isn't going to hurt. Please don't scream
25210,Elena, Who's that?
25211,Girl, It's my little sister
25212,Elena, Get out of here. Go back to class
25213,Damon, What the hell are you doing?
25214,Elena," I just... I saw the picture, and I..."
25215,Damon," Everybody is someone's Uncle or father or camp counselor or Bible study teacher. Elena, you don't know these people. Why do you care?"
25216,Elena," I care because I'm still me! I still have the same feelings, Damon. Sorry if that spoils your master plan to turn me into a super vampire"
25217,Bonnie, What's going on? 
25218,Damon, Nothing. Elena's educating me on the importance of feelings
25219,Elena, Did you talk to the Professor?
25220,Bonnie," For a second. He found some stuff of my grams in his office and he's going to dig it up for me. Oh, uh, this"
25221,Damon," Oh, nice. The answer to all of our problems. A frat party, douche central. Which is why you'll be eating very well tonight. So what should we go as? v*ctim or k*ll?"
25222,Klaus," You feeling all right, mate? Are the shackles too tight? Welcome home, sister"
25223,Rebekah, This is a trick? How do you know he's one of the five? Where's his bloody tattoo?
25224,Klaus," Oh, the tattoos aren't visible on this lot like they were on the last. Let's eat"
25225,Klaus," Thank you, my lovely. I could kiss the council for burning up all the vervain in town. They made my life so much easier. Rebekah, love, eat your veggies"
25226,Rebekah, I'm not eating till you apologize
25227,Klaus, For which indiscretion? There have been so many
25228,Rebekah, You broke my neck
25229,Klaus, You threw away Elena's bl*od so I can't make any more hybrids
25230,Rebekah, 'Cause you took me for granted!
25231,Klaus," That's what big brothers do, sweetheart!"
25232,Stefan, Let me just name the million other people I'd rather be having dinner with right now
25233,Klaus," All right, fine. I'm sorry. I often forget how delicate you are. Forgive me?"
25234,Rebekah, I'll take it under consideration
25235,Stefan," Ok, good. Ahem. Now, why don't you tell me about Rebekah's hunter?"
25236,Klaus," Right. Alexander. Nice chap, forgoing the obvious issues. He was looking for creatures of the night, which is why we felt quite safe around him wearing our daylight rings"
25237,Alexander, I'm unaccustomed to such luxury
25238,Elijah," Well, it's the least we could to repay you for opening our eyes to the truth. We're curious to hear more about your order. Your crusade"
25239,Alexander, We are but five men. Bound by fire and the last breath of a dying witch to a single cause. The destruction of all vampires
25240,Klaus, And how do you hope to achieve this?
25241,Alexander," We have the ultimate w*apon, which no vampire can survive"
25242,Stefan," So, that's what this is about? A w*apon?"
25243,Rebekah, Not just any w*apon
25244,Klaus," Rebekah, love, don't get ahead of the story"
25245,Stefan, How is a w*apon the answer to all of my prayers?
25246,Stefan, Why don't we just skip with the theatrics and get right to the point?
25247,Klaus," Not quite yet. Because in order to find this w*apon, we need to solve the puzzle, which seems to have disappeared"
25248,Stefan, What puzzle?
25249,Stefan, The tattoo. What is it?
25250,Klaus, A map. Leading us to its treasure
25251,Rebekah, Fat lot of good a tattoo's going to do if we can't see it
25252,Klaus," We can't, but someone else can. Why don't you tell the hybrid to bring him in, love? You see, the hunter was so eager to get to the bottom of his mystery tattoos that he mentioned there was only one other person who could see them"
25253,Klaus," I wouldn't. Lucky for us, young Jeremy here is a bit of an artist"
25254,Jeremy, I'm not helping you with anything
25255,Klaus, I'm afraid you are
25256,Guy, Hey. I'm Frankie. Unassuming serial k*ll
25257,Damon, I'm Jack. And these are the two lovely ladies I just... Rippered
25258,Frankie, Welcome to the m*rder house. Bloody Mary's free until midnight. Enjoy yourselves
25259,Damon," Well, hats off to these idiots"
25260,Damon," Oh, look, there's Professor creepy"
25261,Bonnie," His name is Professor Shane, and he's not creepy. I'm going to go talk to him"
25262,Damon, You do that
25263,Damon," Inebriated sleaze balls all covered in bl*od. Come on, pick one"
25264,Elena, I think I found one
25265,Damon, Roofie guy? Nice choice. Go get 'em
25266,Elena, I'm sorry. Drink?
25267,Guy, Sure
25268,Guy," Great party, right?"
25269,Elena, Yeah
25270,Elena, You're not going to make a sound
25271,Damon," Now remember, the idea is not to k*ll him. Elena! Elena, step away from the ledge. Elena!"
25272,Elena, Leave and forget about this
25273,Damon, Nice touch. How do you feel?
25274,Elena, I feel good
25275,Elena, I want more
25276,Connor, You set me up at the hospital. Led me to a trap. Why?
25277,Jeremy, You were trying to hurt people who are important to me
25278,Connor, Important to you? That vampire just threatened to k*ll you. I don't understand how you could see the tattoo if you're a sympathizer
25279,Jeremy," What exactly do you understand? 'Cause a couple days ago, you seemed to have all the answers and now you're no jack. Where did this tattoo come from? Why am I the only one who can see it?"
25280,Connor," Years ago, I met someone with a mark. Claimed he had this intense desire to k*ll vampires. Like it was ingrained in his DNA. Told me the same thing I told you... if I could see the mark, I was a potential"
25281,Jeremy, Who was he?
25282,Connor," Just a guy I served in Iraq with. I lost track of him, and then one day... The tattoo just showed up on me. It started on my hand, but the more vampires I k*ll, the more it spread, like... Like it was trying to tell me something. I just... I just don't know what"
25283,Stefan, So tell me more about this tattoo
25284,Klaus," My sister's suitor was unwilling to tell us anything. Rebekah, however, was more than willing to... Investigate, isn't that right?"
25285,Rebekah, How do you read these symbols?
25286,Alexander, The map took my brothers and I years to translate. The sword... Is the key to reading it. Have you considered my offer? To come with me when I leave to follow the map?
25287,Rebekah, I have. And I would like that very much
25288,Rebekah, What is that?
25289,Alexander," Oh, that? That... Is a very special w*apon. For a very special kind of vampire. When my brotherhood has achieved its destiny, those monsters will cease to exist. Until then, we have the daggers"
25290,Rebekah, Do you really believe they're all so evil they must be put down?
25291,Alexander, Let us not talk of such evil. Let us do this
25292,Alexander, Mmm. And this
25293,Alexander, And this
25294,Klaus," My sister's boyfriend threw a slumber party that night. He and his brothers put us all down in our sleep. Elijah, Kol, Finn... And me"
25295,Rebekah, How was I supposed to know?
25296,Klaus, Cheers. To my sister's uncanny ability to choose men
25297,Stefan, I thought the daggers didn't work on you because of your werewolf side
25298,Klaus, They don't
25299,Rebekah, What happened?
25300,Klaus, Ask him
25301,Klaus," Only, he cannot answer because I have ripped out his tongue, along with the rest of them"
25302,Rebekah," Nik, I had no idea!"
25303,Klaus, But you should have. Your only family was nearly wiped out because of your stupidity! What did he promise you?
25304,Rebekah, Nothing. Nothing
25305,Klaus, He would not have made a move unless he knew you were vulnerable. You trusted him... Over me! What did he promise you?
25306,Rebekah," Nothing, Nik, I swear! "
25307,Klaus," What did he promise you?! Tell me, Rebekah!"
25308,Klaus," Go ahead, Rebekah, tell him. Tell him what the hunter told you the tattoo leads to. What's this great w*apon that could bring about the end of the vampire species?"
25309,Rebekah, A cure. He said there was a cure
25310,Stefan, There is no cure for vampirism
25311,Rebekah," I'm telling the truth, Stefan"
25312,Stefan," Then why wouldn't you have searched for it, found it?"
25313,Klaus," Because when the hunters drew their final breath that night, the marks disappeared from their body. The map was gone, the brotherhood of the five extinct. For 900 years, there was not a whisper of another hunter until our friend in there showed up in town"
25314,Rebekah," Well, now we have the map, what do we do next?"
25315,Klaus," We don't do anything. You can't be trusted, little sister. You'll be blabbing this secret to the first boy who calls you pretty. I mean, it's pathetic, really, isn't it? How she continues to hand her heart to any man who shows her a hint of affection. You think she would have learned by now from the endless cycle of disappointment and deception!"
25316,Rebekah," But I haven't! Instead I stay with you and let you leech every moment of happiness from my life. You know, at least I fared better than Finn. Klaus left him daggered because he was tired of his judgment"
25317,Klaus," No, Finn was a dullard. He's more interesting lying in a box"
25318,Rebekah," You want the cure for Elena, don't you? So you can go back to mass producing your hybrids. That's why you brought Stefan in, 'cause you knew he'd help you even though he hates your guts. You know what, you can shove your cure"
25319,Stefan," Well, I hope you got what you wanted out of her before you chased her off"
25320,Klaus, She never would have told me what I needed to know. But she'll tell you
25321,Stefan, What do you need me to find out?
25322,Klaus, The map is useless without the tool to decipher it
25323,Stefan, The sword
25324,Klaus, She knows where it is. And you're going to get her to tell you. You have a chance to save Elena from the very thing that's going to destroy her. You can call it a deal with the devil if you like but you know you won't walk away from it
25325,Professor Shane," I put your grandmother's stuff around here somewhere. There were a couple family photos and a first edition Stephen king. Did you know she liked ""cujo""?"
25326,Bonnie, This is amazing. It's all stuff you picked up on your travels?
25327,Professor Shane," Yeah. I, uh, I do this thing. It's like a one man traveling occult exhibit to small towns. It funds my crazy Indiana Jones adventures"
25328,Professor Shane, Do you practice? Like she did? I'm a true believer. Just don't tell anyone
25329,Bonnie," No, I don't practice. Not anymore. I lost control of myself and there were consequences"
25330,Professor Shane," Witches love their consequences, don't they? You know, there are other ways to practice magic. If you're interested"
25331,Bonnie, Are you...
25332,Professor Shane," No. No, no, no. I'm just, uh, I'm just a guy with a very open mind who has seen a lot of things. And I'm willing to test some of them out. If you are"
25333,Elena, Don't scream. This isn't going to hurt
25334,Elena, Oh my god
25335,Elena, Oh my god
25336,Elena, I have to get out of here
25337,Klaus," Nice lines. Now, if you could just hurry it up a little bit"
25338,Jeremy, I'm done
25339,Klaus, What is this?
25340,Jeremy, It's the tattoo
25341,Klaus," I've seen the tattoo, you repugnant punk. There's more to it"
25342,Jeremy," That's all of it. He said every time he k*ll a vampire, it spreads"
25343,Klaus, Nate!
25344,Klaus, Tell the girl to take Jeremy home. Keep this one alive at all costs
25345,Nate," Looks like you got too much leash. You're not going anywhere, so you might as well stop the racket"
25346,Nate, You're lucky I can't k*ll you. Freak
25347,Elena, Who am I? Why am I acting like this?
25348,Bonnie, Because you listened to Damon and Damon makes everything he wants sound like a good idea
25349,Elena, I should be here with Stefan. I shouldn't be here with him. I should be going through all this with Stefan
25350,Damon, I'm guessing we should hit the road
25351,Bonnie," You were supposed to help her, and you let her get completely out of control"
25352,Damon," She's not out of control, she was having fun"
25353,Bonnie, This isn't fun. She's acting like a different person!
25354,Damon," She is a different person! She's a vampire. We're a predatory species. We enjoy the hunt, the feed, and the k*ll. And when the guilt gets too bad, we switch off our humanity and we revel in it"
25355,Bonnie, Is that what you want? Her to be like you?
25356,Damon," She already is like me. And you know what makes me able to drink my fill and leave someone breathing and not rip my head off like my brother, is that I can revel in it. I can make it fun"
25357,Rebekah, I got your message. I'm sorry. I know you wanted my help. He just...Makes me so angry
25358,Stefan, No one deserves to be treated that way
25359,Rebekah, I wanted it back then. The cure. I was willing to leave behind my family for it. Would you take it if you had the chance? Or is it just for Elena?
25360,Stefan," Part of me wishes that she and I can have an eternity together but Damon's right. There's not a single vampire who hasn't k*ll a human. Elena will k*ll. And then there will be the pain, and the guilt, and then..."
25361,Rebekah, The humanity switch
25362,Stefan," Elena, she's driven by love. By compassion. When she turns off her humanity, then I don't think we'll ever get her back. So I'd do anything to save her"
25363,Rebekah," I envy that. You and Elena. I envy the love you have. I really did believe Alex when he said he loved me. He promised we'd be married. We even picked out a church. San Vittore in Brienno. I know you want my help, Stefan. But I just can't do anything that lets my brother get what he wants"
25364,Stefan," I never did answer your question. If it meant that I got to be with her... Have children, grow old with her... If it meant that we'd die together, be buried together... Then, yes. I'd take the cure"
25365,Rebekah," I buried him. Even after everything. I laid him to rest in the place where we would be married. What kind of hopeless fool does that? Ohh. But that's what you wanted to know, isn't it? Because I buried him with his sword"
25366,Klaus," I'm sorry, little sister, but you're right. You really are a hopeless fool"
25367,Stefan," I'm sorry, Rebekah"
25368,Rebekah," Go right ahead. Laugh at the girl who loved too easily. Well, I would rather have lived my life than yours, Nick. No one will ever sit around the table telling stories about a man who couldn't love. Do it. Look me in the eye and do it, you coward! Do it!"
25369,Klaus, I have a plane waiting. I'll get the sword. My hybrids will keep an eye on Connor. You put Rebekah somewhere no one will find her and make sure Jeremy forgets everything he heard today
25370,Stefan, I'll take care of it
25371,Klaus," No one must know about the cure, do you understand? Not Damon, not Elena. Nobody. If this gets out, it could mean all our deaths. So if you tell anyone, I'll erase each and every memory from all of you"
25372,Stefan, I won't say anything
25373,Klaus," It's just you and me in this, Stefan. Some secrets are stronger than family"
25374,Damon, Well then. Good night
25375,Elena," Damon… I'm sorry. Things got a little heated at the party, and... I shouldn't have let that happen. It's just that I... I feel like..."
25376,Damon," what do you feel, Elena?"
25377,Elena," When you tell me what a vampire should be, deep down, I believe you. I think that you're right, and I... I hate that feeling. Because I don't want to be..."
25378,Damon, You don't want to be like me
25379,Elena, Hey
25380,Stefan, Hey
25381,Elena, What are you doing here?
25382,Stefan, Just hanging out with Jeremy. We had a couple things to talk about
25383,Damon, Any news on the hunter?
25384,Stefan," No. No, nothing new"
25385,Damon, Then today was a bust. She's all yours
25386,Stefan," So, uh... What happened?"
25387,Elena," I learned how to feed without hurting someone. It was awful. You were right, I... Got caught up in it"
25388,Stefan," Ah, it'll get easier"
25389,Elena," But I don't want it to get easier. I can't live like this. Stefan, I'm... Feeling things that I don't... I don't want to feel, and I'm becoming someone that I don't want to be. I don't think I'm going to survive this"
25390,Stefan," Hey. Yes, you will. I promise"
25391,Elena, No
25392,Stefan, You just have to hold on
25393,Nate," Yeah, I got it. I'll keep him fat and happy. You should send two more for protection. Make that three"
25394,Professor Shane, Shouldn't you be in Mystic Falls k*ll vampires?
25395,Connor, Why the hell did you send me there?
25396,Connor, You have any idea what I've been through? I spent the last two days chained up by an original vampire
25397,Shane, So you met Klaus? I only know him by reputation. Apparently he's a real monster
25398,Connor, He's a vampire-werewolf hybrid. Do you know how hard it is to k*ll them?
25399,Shane," From what I gather, you have to... Remove their head, or their heart. That is, according to lore. I'm just speculating"
25400,Connor," I had to figure out how to do it on my own. I could have used some of this occult Professor knowledge of yours. But then again, you've always been slow when it comes to providing answers."
25401,Shane, We had a deal. I'll give you answers about your hunter's mark when it's grown to completion
25402,Connor," In other words, k*ll as many vampires as possible"
25403,Shane," Come on, Connor, why do you think I sent you to Mystic Falls? There's no shortage of vampires. That town's practically infested. Listen, there's a witch mixed up in all this. She's important to what I have planned. I want her to be kept out of harm's way"
25404,Connor, Anybody gets in my way… anybody… they're dead
25405,Shane," Ok... Sure, I'll occupy her myself. Just do what you do. And the less I know about it, the better"
25406,Connor, Do I have your attention? Good. Then let's talk about vampires
25407,Elena," Dear diary, I know it's been a while. A long while. I haven't needed... I haven't wanted to write this stuff down. But I don't want to say it out loud, either. The thing is... I'm a vampire. And I hate it"
25408,Stefan," She's been spiraling since her transition. There are times I barely recognize her. But now for the first time in a while, there's hope"
25409,Elena, I feel hopeless. Depressed. Angry. But most of all... I'm scared
25410,Stefan," Somewhere in the world, there's a cure for vampires. If I can get it, Elena can be human again. I can give her back her life"
25411,Elena," Part of me just wants to end it. But then I think of Jeremy. I'm all that he has left. So, I need to find a way through this. No matter what it takes."
25412,Stefan," So that's what I need to do. No matter what Klaus asks; no matter what lies I have to tell, secrets I have to keep, I'll do it. No matter what it takes "
25413,Stefan, How the hell did Connor escape?
25414,Klaus," I blame mind-numbing incompetence, but pointing fingers isn't going to help me. You're going to help me"
25415,Stefan," Well, he could be anywhere now"
25416,Klaus," Think, Stefan. He took the hybrid's head, which means he wants werewolf toxin"
25417,Stefan, Which means he plans to stay in Mystic Falls to k*ll vampires
25418,Klaus," Which is a pity. Me being on the other side of the world digging up a dead hunter, you'll have no access to my bl*od. And therefore the antidote. Nevertheless, his tattoo is our only map to the cure, so your task is quite simple. Find him, catch him, and above all, keep him alive. He's no good to us dead"
25419,Stefan, Damon's been looking everywhere for him. If they cross paths...
25420,Klaus, You need to keep Damon in check
25421,Stefan, It would be a lot easier if I could just tell him the truth
25422,Klaus, You trust Damon with the cure? I imagine he prefers Elena the way she is
25423,Stefan," Nice try, Klaus, but I trust Damon a hell of a lot more than I trust you"
25424,Klaus," And I trust no one. Which is why my sister is lying daggered in a box. The more who find out about the cure, the more will go after it. Nations have gone to w*r over less. You mark my words… tell one soul and I will throw the hunter's sword in the Mediterranean and we can end this quest right now. Am I understood?"
25425,Matt," Really? Jeremy, you're half an hour late. Get here now"
25426,April," Uh, Matt?"
25427,Matt," Uh, hey, April. We don't open till eleven"
25428,April," Oh, sorry. I wasn't, like, trying to scare you or stalk you or whatever. I just, um, I came to ask if you've seen Rebekah?"
25429,Matt, Why would I have seen Rebekah?
25430,April," Oh, I just assumed. I mean, aren't you guys kind of like a thing?"
25431,Matt, Rebekah and I are not a thing
25432,April," Well, I mean, I'm worried about her. She said she'd help me find stuff out about the fire that k*ll my dad, and then she just disappeared"
25433,Connor, Trust me... That's the least of your problems
25434,Elena, Oh. Excuse me. What are you doing?
25435,Damon, Where's Stefan?
25436,Elena," Ok, good morning to you, too"
25437,Damon," He's not answering his phone and he's not here, which, you know, big deal, we've only got a k*ll vampire hunter on the loose"
25438,Elena, I haven't talked to him yet today
25439,Damon, Hmm. Give me your phone. Maybe he's dodging me
25440,Elena, Why would he be dodging you?
25441,Damon," Oh, I don't know, maybe the hot, sweaty dance party business? I figured you spilled your guilty little guts to him when I left last night"
25442,Damon," Ohh, you didn't tell him, did you?"
25443,Elena," No, Damon. I didn't tell him that I got high on bl*od like some crack head and dirty danced with you. It was a mistake, ok? I wasn't...Myself. And besides, he's already got enough to deal with, trying to get me through this vampire stuff"
25444,Damon," Oh, I see. This is classic shame spiral"
25445,Elena, I'm not in a shame spiral
25446,Damon," Oh, you so are. Newbie vampire remorse? Whoof, it's worse than a hangover"
25447,Elena," I'm not in a shame spiral, Damon!"
25448,Stefan, It's Stefan. Leave a message
25449,Damon, So either he's dodging both of us...
25450,Elena, Or something's wrong
25451,Connor, Sit down. Sit down!
25452,Connor," Gilbert, give me your cell phone"
25453,Jeremy," Look, at least let April go. She doesn't have anything to do with this"
25454,Connor, She has everything to do with this
25455,Connor," Her and her father. Plus, she and I have history"
25456,April, What are you talking about? I've never seen you before in my life!
25457,Connor, You kids need to get some vervain. And don't just wear it as a bracelet where anybody can just take it off. Maybe then you'd remember our conversation at the hybrid's yesterday
25458,Jeremy, Our conversation? Are you saying someone compelled me?!
25459,April, Will someone please tell me what he's talking about?!
25460,Connor, Compulsion. Secrets. Vampires
25461,Matt," If you know so much, then you know our friends are going to come for us"
25462,Connor," Oh, yeah, I'm counting on it. Every vampire that comes for you is another one I get to k*ll. Now, who should I text first, hmm? Damon Salvatore? His brother Stefan? Tyler Lockwood? All of the above"
25463,Damon," So we each take a different entrance, hit him at the same time"
25464,Elena, Stefan
25465,Damon, Where the hell have you been?
25466,Stefan, Coming up with a plan
25467,Damon," Yeah, we have a plan. The plan is I'm going to rip Connor's heart out and I am going to feed it to him"
25468,Stefan, That's not a plan. We need to be careful. Connor has Jeremy and who knows how many other hostages
25469,Damon, Hence the open heart surgery
25470,Elena," Damon's right. Connor's strong, but he's not going to be able to take all of us"
25471,Tyler," I called in the hybrids to help, too."
25472,Caroline, My mom put squad cars blocking the streets. They're saying it's a faulty gas main. We're good to go
25473,Damon," Good. Great. No cop, no witnesses, no reason to wait around"
25474,Stefan," All right, hold on, you're not all going"
25475,Tyler," He sh*t me like 9 times. If we're k*ll him, I want in"
25476,Elena," He's got Jeremy, I'm going"
25477,Stefan," Listen, nobody is going anywhere until I figure out what we're walking into"
25478,Damon," Until you figure it out? Is that where you've been all morning, out buying bossy pants?"
25479,Stefan," This guy's known for setting traps, right? We'd be pretty dumb to walk into one, especially if he has werewolf venom"
25480,Elena, Does he?
25481,Stefan, He's had it before
25482,Damon," Fine. Fine. You want to take some time to do recon, you get one hour. But we're going to need some extra help, so where the hell's the wicked witch of the west?"
25483,Caroline, She can't do magic
25484,Damon," Really? Well, call her, tell her Jeremy's life is in danger. Maybe that'll bring her out of retirement"
25485,Bonnie, I can't believe you wrote a book
25486,Shane," I did. I wrote three books, actually. Two of them are just too mortifying to display"
25487,Bonnie," Oh, I'm finding them online"
25488,Shane," No, no, you're not. Hey, come on, you promised, remember? Right? No cell phones, and no Internet during witch therapy. Here. This is yours"
25489,Shane, Right now I want you to focus. And I want your undivided attention
25490,Bonnie, You really think you can help me start practicing magic again?
25491,Shane," Absolutely, I can. I invited you here because I can. But you know what, right now, just relax. Drink your tea. I got this in Australia when I was backpacking with these aborigine spirit guides. Trust me, it's better when you smoke it, but I'm trying to be a role model. Bonnie... Listen, the thing is, what I have in mind might come off as a little unorthodox"
25492,Bonnie, Now I'm officially curious
25493,Shane, What do you know about hypnosis?
25494,Bonnie, You really think that would work?
25495,Shane," What, you practice witchcraft but you don't believe in hypnotism? Bonnie, listen... You're afraid to practice magic because those witch spirits convinced you it's wrong. They threatened your grams and they made you feel guilty. You just have to confront that fear... And that guilt. And remove it"
25496,Bonnie, Maybe. I don't think hypnosis would work. Witches are naturally immune to any sort of manipulation
25497,Shane," Really? Well, let me ask you something. How'd you like to put that earring back on?"
25498,Klaus, You expect me to care about bloody hostages?
25499,Stefan," Well, you should. Damon does. So does Caroline, Tyler, Elena. If any of them get to Connor, then you just wasted a trip to Italy. I can buy us some time, but Damon's getting antsy. So if you want Connor alive, you better get your hybrids onboard with my plan"
25500,Elena, Who is he talking to?
25501,Damon," Bonnie, hopefully. Maybe she's decided to make herself useful again"
25502,Elena, What is that?
25503,Damon," It's our way in, courtesy of Alaric Saltzman's interest in the Mystic Falls Underground Railroad"
25504,Elena," The tunnels, like the ones in the Lockwood cellar"
25505,Damon, Yep
25506,Elena, What did you find out?
25507,Stefan, I could only make out the voices
25508,Damon, How many hostages?
25509,Stefan," Three. But, Elena, it's Matt. And April young"
25510,Elena, What?!
25511,Damon, Those two idiots. They're like danger magnets
25512,Elena, We have to get them out of there
25513,Stefan," Yeah, I just need a little more time"
25514,Damon," The clock's ticking, brother"
25515,Stefan," You know, I could do without the color commentary"
25516,Elena, I'm going in these tunnels
25517,Damon," No, you're not. This guy doesn't know that you're a vampire. Let's keep it that way"
25518,Elena," Well, maybe that's it. I can offer to trade myself in exchange for the hostages"
25519,Damon," No! Best case scenario is, now you're a hostage. Worst case scenario…he figures you out, k*ll you on the spot"
25520,Elena," Stop treating me like I can't handle myself. Alaric trained me, and I've been practicing with Stefan"
25521,Damon," So what? Now you're going to take on a professional k*ll? Bang, you're dead. Now what?"
25522,Elena, Head sh*t's no good. It has to be the heart. So now you're dead
25523,Damon," For someone that doesn't want to be like me, you sure are good at it"
25524,Elena," My brother's the only thing that's holding me together right now, Damon. If anything happens to him..."
25525,Damon, We'll get him out. I promise
25526,April," He's clearly delusional. I mean, right? All this… all this talk about vampires? I…I mean, he mentioned my dad"
25527,Matt," Hey, this guy's a nut job, ok? Don't let him get in your head"
25528,April, What if he knows something? Jeremy...Did he say anything to you about why he's doing this?
25529,Jeremy, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I just can't remember
25530,Matt, Let it go. Jeremy!
25531,Jeremy, You said we had a conversation yesterday?
25532,Connor, Mm-hmm
25533,Jeremy, About what?
25534,Connor," We'll get into that. First, take a look at my handiwork. Pick up some tips from the hunter's trade"
25535,Jeremy, What is all that?
25536,Connor," The fluid is derived from werewolf toxin. Trip the wire, b*mb goes off, nails deliver a lethal dose into the bloodstream"
25537,Jeremy, And what's the point? What do you get out of all this?
25538,Connor," You know, I used to think that there was no ""get"". That I was just supposed to ""do"". k*ll vampires. That was until I realized that the mark held the answer to why I'm the way I am. The more I k*ll, the more it grows, and once it's complete... I'll learn my story, and… and all this will have meant something"
25539,Connor, Hey! We're going to have visitors soon. You two get in the back. Get up! Move!
25540,Connor," And before you think about any other exits, I got every door rigged. Got it?"
25541,Damon, Stefan's on his way. This will be over soon
25542,Elena," Will it? I mean, haven't we already been here before with Jeremy? Isn't this why we sent him to Denver?"
25543,Damon," Well, we'll get him out of this and we'll compel him down to the Bahamas. Maybe he'll find an island girl"
25544,Stefan, Did you find the tunnel map?
25545,Damon," Got it. It was in his w*apon's drawer with seven stakes, a weird MacGyver crossbow, and the last remaining vervain in Mystic Falls. So, how about we get this party started?"
25546,Stefan, Not yet. Klaus is sending one of his men. He'll take the front and you and I can take the tunnels
25547,Damon, Since when do we team up with Klaus and the lollipop guild?
25548,Stefan," Well, I already told you, Connor has werewolf venom. We need someone to draw his fire, the hybrids are immune to it, so they're our best bet"
25549,Damon," Well, how are you sure he even has werewolf venom? Why is Klaus involved, Stefan?"
25550,Stefan," Oh, stop being paranoid, Damon"
25551,Damon, Start telling the truth...Stefan. Why is Klaus involved? Did he compel you?
25552,Stefan," I am telling you the truth, this is the best way to get everyone out"
25553,Elena, What is with you two? We're wasting time!
25554,Damon," You know what, she's right. Screw your plan. I'll k*ll Connor myself"
25555,Elena, Stefan! Why are you doing this?
25556,Stefan," Damon had the right idea with the tunnels, but I'm not going to go in there if I can't count on him to do it my way"
25557,Elena, If you can't count on him? You just vervained him!
25558,Stefan," Do you think he cares about April or Matt? He'll get Jeremy out for you, but then he'll go right after Connor no matter who gets hurt"
25559,Elena, Then I'm coming with you
25560,Stefan," You're not coming with me, Elena!"
25561,Elena, You need my help!
25562,Stefan, What if Connor attacks and you have to defend yourself? And what if you k*ll him? The guilt will wreck you
25563,Elena," You don't think that I'm afraid of that? Of course I am. Stefan, I'm barely holding it together. If Jeremy gets hurt…"
25564,Stefan," we'll get Jeremy out, ok? I promise you. Elena, listen to me, listen to me. This is the most important thing that I have ever asked you to do. I just need you to trust me. Please"
25565,Tyler," Look, man, this guy is dangerous. He's highly trained, he's armed…"
25566,Hybrid," I can handle myself. Besides, Klaus asked me personally"
25567,Tyler, This is a bad idea
25568,Caroline," Uh, who are you? "
25569,Haley, Who the hell are you?
25570,Caroline, Caroline
25571,Haley, Ohh. You're Tyler's girl. He told me about you. I'm Haley
25572,Caroline," Well, Haley, that's pretty crazy, 'cause I haven't heard a thing about you"
25573,Haley, I've been staying here a few days
25574,Caroline, Excuse me?
25575,Haley," I needed a place to crash, Ty's a buddy. He was kind enough to offer"
25576,Caroline," I know all of Ty's buddies and I haven't heard about you, so how about we cut the crap?"
25577,Haley," Yeah, I don't do teen drama. Take it up with Ty. Excuse me"
25578,Haley," Dean, you don't need to do this"
25579,Dean," Stay out of this, Haley. I'm going"
25580,Tyler," Just listen to her, man. It's su1c1de"
25581,Tyler," Klaus told you to take Connor by yourself, and you can't even fight back? You have to use ""non-lethal force""? What the hell is that?"
25582,Dean, Klaus gave me a direct order
25583,Haley, It's too dangerous. That maniac already k*ll Nate
25584,Dean," You're not a hybrid; you don't know what it's like. Klaus asks for something, you do it"
25585,Tyler," Look... I'm a hybrid. I used to do everything Klaus said. But I don't anymore. You don't have to, either"
25586,Dean," You think you can stand up to Klaus? Here, prove it"
25587,Caroline," Tyler, don't..."
25588,Klaus, Hello?
25589,Tyler," Hey, Klaus"
25590,Klaus, Tyler. I hope you're not causing problems
25591,Tyler, I can do whatever I want. I'm not sired to you anymore
25592,Klaus," Fair enough. Though I do happen to know your little secret about your time in Appalachia. What was your friend's name? Haley, was it? You'd probably prefer I kept that to myself. I'm sorry, mate. Are you going to answer or should I just assume you're back to being... How did you phrase it? Oh, yes. My little bitch "
25593,Tyler, Ahem. Do whatever the hell you want
25594,Haley, That's it? You just back down?!
25595,Connor, We're closed
25596,Stefan, I want you to free the hostages
25597,Connor, I'll free them. As soon as you give me what I want… you and everyone like you dead
25598,Stefan," What, so your hunter's mark can grow? Yeah, I know all about that. What it means. What you are. Listen, you free the hostages and you and I can have a little chat. Maybe I can tell you about the brotherhood of the five"
25599,Connor, That's a weak move. You must be desperate
25600,Stefan," Think about it, Connor. Klaus saved your life, he needs you alive. Aren't you the least bit curious why?"
25601,April," When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me these scary stories about vampires"
25602,Matt, They're just stories
25603,April, Not to that man out there. There's something so familiar... About him
25604,Matt," Look, this is a messed up situation. The last thing that you want to do is buy into that guy's craziness. You're going to be fine. We're getting out of here"
25605,April, What is that?
25606,Matt, There used to be an exit through the old wine cellar
25607,Matt, They bricked it over
25608,April," So that's it, then? We're screwed"
25609,Matt, No. We're not screwed
25610,Dean, There's no sign of anyone
25611,Klaus," Stefan's coming at him from the other side. He'll free the hostages, your job is to get Connor out alive and use caution, mate. He favors booby traps and ambushes"
25612,Dean, Understood
25613,Connor," You may be a potential hunter, but you make one move, I will break all 27 bones in your hand"
25614,Jeremy," They're not all bad, you know? Some of them, they're my friends"
25615,Connor," Friends, huh? Yeah, I had a friend like that once. She got turned by this vampire I was hunting. He thought it'd be ironic"
25616,Jeremy, What happened to her?
25617,Connor," I didn't want to hurt her. She promised that she would keep it under control, but... A vampire's like a loaded g*n. Eventually it's going to go off. That's when I got this"
25618,Jeremy, So you k*ll your own friend?
25619,Connor," Listen! If you're going to be like me, you need to understand. Vampires k*ll humans. Hunters k*ll vampires"
25620,Connor, We have company
25621,Matt, Oh my god
25622,Stefan, Follow this map. Get out of here. Take her to Caroline's so she can...
25623,Matt," Okay. Stefan! That guy's armed. If you go out there, he's going to k*ll Jeremy"
25624,Stefan, No one's k*ll anyone. Go
25625,Stefan," Connor, you don't have to do this"
25626,Jeremy, Stefan…
25627,Elena," Stefan, call me. There was an expl*si*n at the grill. I need to know what's happening"
25628,Elena, Damon. Hey. Can you get up?
25629,Damon," Oh, where's Stefan? I'm going to k*ll him"
25630,Damon, Ow-ow! Ow!
25631,Elena, He took your ring? Why would he do that?
25632,Damon," Ughh. Because he's playing us. All this stalling, getting the hybrids, taking my ring, add it up. He's either made a deal with Klaus or he's compelled"
25633,Elena, Then I need to get in there
25634,Damon," No, Elena, this guy is dangerous!"
25635,Elena," So am I, Damon!"
25636,Damon, Then you need to be smart. He doesn't know you're a vampire. You get as close as you can. And k*ll him
25637,Stefan," Connor, we can end this right now. Just put down the g*n and come with me"
25638,Connor," Sure, come out. I'll hand the g*n over"
25639,Stefan," Think about this, no one has to die. I'll tell you everything you need to know"
25640,Connor, I don't make deals with vampires!
25641,Stefan," Listen to me. If you die right now, then your whole life, all that k*ll, it will all be for nothing. I can give you the truth. Put down the g*n and let Jeremy go"
25642,Elena, Please! Don't hurt him
25643,Connor," Come any closer, he's dead"
25644,Jeremy," Elena, get out of here"
25645,Elena, He's the only family that I have left. Just…just let him go
25646,Connor, You hear that? Your girl's watching. I will sh**t the boy right in front of her! On the count of three! 1... 2...
25647,Elena, Jeremy?
25648,Elena, I'm sorry… I….
25649,Jeremy," Hey, it's ok. You don't have to hide it; I know you're not going to hurt me"
25650,Elena," How did this happen, Jer? Why did Connor come after you?"
25651,Jeremy," He said I was like him, because I could see his tattoo"
25652,Elena, His what?
25653,Jeremy, His hunter's mark. It's invisible to everyone but me. Stefan and Damon didn't tell you about it?
25654,Elena, No. Who else knows about this?
25655,Jeremy," Well, that's the thing. I don't even know. Apparently I was with Connor all day yesterday, but I can't remember. Someone compelled me"
25656,Elena, I think I know who
25657,Damon," Good work, brother"
25658,Stefan," It's over, Damon, I have him"
25659,Damon, Not after what I just went through. I had to punch through a boiler room basement into a septic t*nk to get into this stupid tunnel. But it'll be worth it
25660,Stefan, I'm taking him with me
25661,Damon," That's the thing… you're not. I don't know what you're up to or what Klaus has over you, but even if I have to go through you, I'm going to k*ll him"
25662,Stefan," Better back off, Damon"
25663,Damon, Why? Because Klaus wants him alive?
25664,Stefan," This has nothing to do with Klaus, you're just going to have to trust me on that"
25665,Damon," Don't want to. Don't have to. Not gonna. You can give him to me, brother"
25666,Stefan, Run as fast as you can
25667,Stefan, You're not going to k*ll him!
25668,Damon, Why are you protecting him? Tell me. Tell me!
25669,Stefan, Klaus will k*ll anyone who knows!
25670,Damon, Then it has to be good. Spill it. Spill it!
25671,Stefan, Connor's tattoo is the key to a cure
25672,Damon, The cure for what?
25673,Stefan, For her! For Elena
25674,Damon, Klaus told you there's a cure for vampirism?
25675,Stefan," And if Connor dies, then we'll lose it forever. I know it's crazy, Damon, but its hope. Do you understand me? It's her only hope!"
25676,Elena, You stay the hell away from my brother!
25677,Connor, Look at you. So worried about your brother. And you're the biggest monster he'll ever meet
25678,Elena, You missed
25679,Bonnie, This isn't working. It's not you. I just…I can't get into hypnosis
25680,Shane," Bonnie, what do you think we've been doing for seven hours?"
25681,Bonnie," Wow, that's crazy"
25682,Shane," Look, I'm good at this, ok? And trust me; you're doing a lot better than you were when you came in this morning. You know what? Proof"
25683,Shane, I bet that you can light this candle as easily as I can sign my name. All you have to do is want to
25684,Bonnie, I'm sorry. I just…I can't
25685,Shane," If you can't... It's only because you're afraid. You're afraid of those spirits and what they might do to your grams. But let me tell you something, Bonnie Bennett… you're stronger than they are. You have a power of your own you haven't even approached yet, and you don't have to be afraid. Of anyone. Say it ""I don't have to be afraid."" "
25686,Bonnie, I don't have to be afraid
25687,Shane, Now close your eyes. And mean it
25688,Bonnie, I don't have to be afraid
25689,Bonnie, Guess it wasn't good enough
25690,Shane," Oh, I don't know"
25691,Stefan, Elena…
25692,Elena," I need to bury him. I k*ll him, I should… I should bury him"
25693,Stefan," Hey. Hey, come on"
25694,Elena," Don't! I heard you talking to him. Making some secret deal with Klaus? You said you were going to protect Jeremy! Keep me from...This. You said that I could trust you, Stefan"
25695,Damon," Elena, it's complicated…"
25696,Elena," no, it's not complicated, Damon! You want to know why? Because… because he's dead now. You told me to k*ll him. So I did. I k*ll… I k*ll someone. I k…I k*ll someone!"
25697,Tyler, I'm so...Sorry
25698,Haley, I can't believe Dean's gone. We could have saved him
25699,Caroline, I apologize. Am I intruding?
25700,Tyler," Caroline, it's not like that"
25701,Caroline, I keep waiting for you to make up some dumb story so at least I can call you a liar. Is that now?
25702,Haley, I'll let you two talk
25703,Caroline," Thank you, how big of you!"
25704,Tyler, You have to understand…
25705,Caroline," no, you don't tell me what I have to do. I went through hell when I thought you died. I cried like an idiot, and this whole time, you've been keeping a secret from me about falling for some werewolf in the Appalachians!"
25706,Tyler, I never fell for her
25707,Caroline," Oh, please"
25708,Tyler," Caroline, she saved my life! I almost died trying to break the sire bond. Haley was there for me. She helped me get through it but nothing else happened!"
25709,Caroline, Then why would Klaus think that?
25710,Tyler," Because I'd rather him think that than know the truth. There are other hybrids that need to be set free. Haley and I can help them. But if Klaus found out about what we're trying to do, he'd k*ll us all"
25711,April," Hey, Jeremy. Sorry we're so late. We had to take this crazy detour"
25712,Matt, There was a gas leak
25713,Jeremy," Yeah, I heard about that"
25714,April," Yeah, and we had to stop by Tyler Lockwood's house 'cause we had to see Caroline. We talked to her for a little bit, but now I was thinking maybe we could all go get some coffee. But the grill is closed. That's...Weird"
25715,Jeremy," You know what, it's ok. I, uh, I need to get home anyway, 'cause I'm feeling a little... Over it today"
25716,Matt," I should probably get home, too"
25717,April," Oh. All right, then"
25718,Jeremy," Hey, uh, April. Did you drop this?"
25719,April," Oh, that's not mine"
25720,Jeremy," You sure? Here, let me see your wrist"
25721,April," Ah, thanks, but…"
25722,Matt, I like it. I think it looks good on you. You should wear it
25723,April, Okay
25724,Matt, Are you ok?
25725,Jeremy," Yeah. I'm just sick of all the secrets, you know?"
25726,Matt," Yeah, tell me about it"
25727,Jeremy, What?
25728,Matt, What's wrong?
25729,Jeremy, Nothing
25730,Damon, How is she?
25731,Stefan," Angry, full of guilt. Hasn't said a word to me other than she wants to be left alone. Is that my journal?"
25732,Damon, Had to go through six locks to get it. Needed something to back up your insanity. Did you figure out how to tell Klaus you lost a hunter and a hybrid?
25733,Stefan, He's on a plane. Which means I get to live for another six hours
25734,Damon," I got your back. You know, when he comes to m*rder you"
25735,Stefan, Thanks. Thanks for not saying anything to Elena
25736,Damon," About what? A cure that we don't have, can't find, and probably doesn't exist? You're welcome"
25737,Stefan, She doesn't need to know that she k*ll her chance of being human again
25738,Damon, Alleged chance
25739,Stefan," I believe him, Damon. You didn't hear Klaus' story. I believed every word he said"
25740,Damon," Well, I'll remain a skeptic for now. So what's your next move?"
25741,Stefan," He said there was a brotherhood of the five. Which means there are other hunters out there, and I'm just going to keep looking until I find one"
25742,Damon," Sure, Stefan, since you asked, I'd be happy to go on a su1c1de mission with you for a potentially non-existent cure. Not a problem"
25743,Stefan," Yet a couple hours ago, you were ready to rip my heart out"
25744,Damon, Because you were being a pain in the ass. I just need one thing… why do you want to cure her?
25745,Stefan, What kind of question is that?
25746,Damon," Legitimate one. You want to cure her because she's a vampire and she's not cut out to be, or you can't love her if she is one?"
25747,Stefan, I'll always love her. But she's not supposed to be this person. I don't want her to be
25748,Damon," Well, if I'm going to ride this fairy tale to its conclusion, let me be clear about one thing"
25749,Stefan, What's that?
25750,Damon," I'm fine with her either way, brother. So if we do this, we're doing it for you"
25751,Elena," Dear diary, today I did the thing I was most afraid of. I lost control. I k*ll someone. I used to think the worst feeling in the world was losing someone you love, but I was wrong "
25752,Elena, The worst feeling is the moment that you realize... You've lost yourself
25753,Connor, Can't sleep?
25754,Connor, You know... It makes sense. Guilty conscience
25755,Elena, You're not here. I'm... I've got to be dreaming
25756,Connor, Then how do you know that I'm not here?
25757,Elena, Because you're...
25758,Connor, Come on. Say it
25759,Elena, Because you're dead
25760,Connor, Yes. I am. Was that the first time that you've taken a human life?
25761,Elena, You're a ghost. It's got to be... You're a ghost. That's... that's what's happening right now. Jeremy. Jeremy!
25762,Elena, You're a ghost. You're haunting me. You're a ghost. You're haunting me
25763,Connor, Can a ghost do this?
25764,Elena, Oh my god! Oh! Jer! Jer!
25765,Elena," Jer! Jer! No, no, no! No! No. No, Jer! Jeremy!"
25766,Elena, I can't believe this happened. What... what am I going to say to him?
25767,Damon, Thanks for not ditching the family ring after it drove Ric crazy? You should have called Stefan
25768,Elena," I don't want to talk to him. He's been lying to me, and hiding things from me. He compelled Jeremy to forget God knows what"
25769,Damon," In all fairness, I mean, I think you k*ll him kind of trumps that. I mean, you should have called Stefan"
25770,Elena," I don't trust him right now, Damon"
25771,Stefan, Hey
25772,Damon, P.S... I called Stefan
25773,Stefan, What happened? Why didn't you call me?
25774,Elena, I just... I need to go upstairs and shower. Clean all the bl*od off my hands
25775,Stefan, Welcome back. How you feeling?
25776,Jeremy, What happened?
25777,Damon, Long story. Buy the e-book
25778,Stefan," Elena? Hey. Listen, I know you're still upset about yesterday, and I get it. Believe me. But just... let me help you"
25779,Elena," I don't want your help right now, Stefan"
25780,Stefan, But you'll accept Damon's?
25781,Elena," Don't make this about Damon! You've been working with Klaus doing God knows what, and don't insult me by trying to deny it"
25782,Stefan," Listen, it's not what you think, ok?"
25783,Elena, I don't know what to think but I do know that I don't want to talk to you and I don't really want to be around you right now
25784,Stefan," Look, please, just..."
25785,Elena," No. This is my brother's bl*od on my hands, Stefan. I stabbed him in the neck last night, so forgive me if I'm not in the mood to listen you try to talk your way out of this"
25786,Tyler," You're still going? I drank enough last night. And then I slept, which is what you guys should have done"
25787,Hybrid, We're just paying our respects to Dean
25788,Tyler," That's great, Chris, but would you pay them at a bar instead?"
25789,Haley, Don't be mad. We're celebrating our fallen hybrid friend
25790,Klaus," Well, don't let me interrupt"
25791,Tyler, I didn't know you were here
25792,Klaus," Clearly. Thought I'd just pop 'round to celebrate Dean's successful retrieval of the vampire hunter. Yet when I arrived, I learned that not only was Dean unsuccessful, but that Elena k*ll the hunter"
25793,Haley," Well, maybe if you had let Dean use force on Connor instead of sending him in on a su1c1de mission..."
25794,Klaus," Maybe you should mind your business, wolf girl"
25795,Tyler," What do you care if Connor's dead, anyway?"
25796,Klaus, I have my reasons. They have ceased to matter. Cheers
25797,Caroline," Brought your stuff. Old laptop, your Jersey, the charm bracelet"
25798,Tyler, Car... This isn't a good time
25799,Caroline, Just take it
25800,Klaus," Caroline. By the break-up drama unfolding before me, I assume you've met Haley. All right, come on, let's go. Let's leave them alone. Your talents are needed elsewhere"
25801,Tyler, For what?
25802,Klaus," I think you've got more important things to deal with, mate"
25803,Caroline, Do you think he bought it?
25804,Haley," Hell, I bought it"
25805,Caroline," Thanks for the head's up that he was here, Haley"
25806,Tyler, You girls are good liars
25807,Damon, Where'd Jeremy go?
25808,Stefan, School. Bonnie has him volunteering for some occult exhibit
25809,Damon, Or maybe he didn't want to linger in a house where his sister just jammed a kn*fe in his neck
25810,Stefan, It's Klaus
25811,Damon," Ooh, time to face the music, pay the piper, dance with the devil"
25812,Stefan," You know, I'm glad you find this amusing. If he finds out I told you about the cure, he'll k*ll both of us"
25813,Damon, Quit avoiding him. You're being shady. Shady people get outed
25814,Stefan, I don't want to talk about it
25815,Klaus," Well, I can't imagine why, what with you ruining all my plans for a hybrid-filled future"
25816,Stefan," Well, it wouldn't happened if you hadn't sworn me to secrecy"
25817,Klaus," Life's full of ifs, Stefan. Let's extenuate the positives, shall we? The hunter was one of five. We'll find another. It may take centuries, but we've got nothing but time, right? "
25818,Stefan, You're using your calm voice today. Who's getting k*ll?
25819,Klaus," Not you, if that's what you're worried about. But I am concerned about your beloved. Have the hallucinations started yet?"
25820,Stefan, What do you know about that?
25821,Klaus, I'll tell you. Where you are?
25822,Stefan, I'm at her house
25823,Klaus, How convenient. So am i
25824,Klaus," You know, this would all be a lot more civilized if I was just invited inside"
25825,Stefan, Bad enough I'm out here talking to you. What do you know?
25826,Klaus," I k*ll the Original five hunters, remember? When one k*ll a hunter, there's a bit of a consequence"
25827,Stefan, What kind of consequence?
25828,Klaus," Hunters were spelled by witches to k*ll vampires. If you prevent one from fulfilling his destiny, then he'll take you down with him"
25829,Stefan, What do you mean? Connor's dead
25830,Klaus," I mean, Connor's death won't prevent him from making Elena his final vampire k*ll. She'll need to come with me now. I'll lock her up; keep her away from any sharp, wooden objects"
25831,Stefan, She's not going anywhere with you
25832,Klaus," But if we leave her alone, she'll take her own life before the day is out"
25833,Stefan, She's stronger than that
25834,Klaus," Is she? Believe me, it's for her own good"
25835,Connor, Would you like some? You seem to enjoy it when you drink from me
25836,Elena, I wasn't myself. I was angry
25837,Connor, Were you yourself when you snapped my neck with your bare hands?
25838,Elena, You staked me!
25839,Connor, 'Cause you're a monster and you deserve to die. Admit it!
25840,Elena, No
25841,Elena, Damon…
25842,Connor, Decomposition starts in the first 24 hours. I'm rotting in an unmarked grave because of you
25843,Elena, No!
25844,Damon, What's wrong? Elena!
25845,Jeremy," Hey, do you see anything on my hand? What if I told you I saw the beginning of a mark like Connor's?"
25846,Matt, Are you serious?
25847,Jeremy, It showed up after he died. He told me that I was a potential; that that's why I could see his mark
25848,Matt," So what does that make you, like the next chosen one or something?"
25849,April," Hey, guys"
25850,Matt, Hey April
25851,Shane," Way to let her do the heavy lifting. I found her wandering the hallways with this. Just teasing. I'm the guy who wrangles all the freaky stuff, Atticus Shane. Please, call me Shane, I beg you. Thank you guys for helping, I really appreciate it. Y'all get free admission to my free exhibit"
25852,April, Why does he look so familiar?
25853,Jeremy, No idea
25854,April," Hey, um, have you guys seen Rebekah? She said she was going to help me look into what caused the expl*si*n at my dad's farm, and then she just..."
25855,Matt," Disappeared, yeah, I know"
25856,Bonnie, You lost her?!
25857,Damon," Well, ""lost"" is a very strong word. We just technically don't know where she is"
25858,Stefan, I'm more worried about what Klaus said about this hunter's curse
25859,Bonnie, How does Klaus even know about this?
25860,Damon, How does Klaus know anything? The guy's like a billion year's old
25861,Stefan, He said it was a witch's curse
25862,Bonnie," You know if I could do anything to help, I would, but I..."
25863,Damon," But nothing. Wave your magic wand, hocus pocus, be gone, hunter, ghosts, whatever"
25864,Bonnie, The spirits won't let me do the magic I need to break the curse. But I can ask Shane for help. He knows everything about everything
25865,Stefan, Great. You two do your thing
25866,Damon, Where you going?
25867,Stefan, To get her back
25868,Elena, Let go of me!
25869,Klaus, Certainly
25870,Klaus," I apologize for the lack of windows. It's to preserve the art. And, of course, to prevent you from taking off your daylight ring and burning yourself to death in the sun"
25871,Elena, I'm not going to k*ll myself. I would never do that
25872,Klaus," Oh, but you'll want to. I did. Problem is, I'm immortal"
25873,Elena, You went through this?
25874,Klaus," Yes, I did. For 52 years, four months and nine days. I was tormented... In my dreams. My every waking moment. Relentless, never-ending torture. It was the only period of my life when I actually felt time"
25875,Elena," So you knew that this would happen if Connor died. That's why you got involved. Did Stefan know, too?"
25876,Klaus," All he knew was that the hunter had to be kept alive. You should have listened to him when he said he had it covered, love"
25877,Elena, What else does Stefan know?
25878,Klaus," Well, that's one of life's little mysteries, isn't it?"
25879,Elena, How did you make it stop?
25880,Klaus, I didn't. Eventually it just stopped. The hallucinations tend to appear in strange forms. Don't say I didn't warn you
25881,Stefan," He's got Elena. I need Tyler to get the other hybrids away so I can get her out. I know I'm probably asking the impossible, but..."
25882,Caroline, Actually... You're not
25883,Tyler," Haley is the one that helped me break the sire bond. She showed me what to do. How to help. When she showed up here, I thought it was just coincidence. But it turns out she's been helping one of them. Her friend Chris. And she came to help us get the rest of them out from under Klaus"
25884,Stefan, So… Are you telling me that Chris isn't sired anymore?
25885,Caroline, That's exactly what he's telling you
25886,Chris," Clothes, toothbrush. Klaus said you're going to be here until he figures out where to put you"
25887,Elena, Just please go away
25888,Connor, I can't. I'm going to be with you forever. A constant reminder of what you've become. So tell me. How did it feel to drain the life out of me?
25889,Elena, It was horrible. It was the worst thing that I've ever done
25890,Connor, You're lying
25891,Elena," No, I'm not"
25892,Connor," Yes, you are. Tell the truth"
25893,Elena, I am telling the truth
25894,Connor, You're lying
25895,Elena, Fine! I liked it. I loved the taste of your bl*od. Are you happy?
25896,Connor," I'm not happy, Elena. I'm dead. Did you know I had a family? A brother? Parents"
25897,Elena, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry
25898,Connor, Are you sorry about your parents? It's your fault they died
25899,Elena, Don't
25900,Connor," They ran off Wickery Bridge with you in the car, but they weren't supposed to be there, were they? They died because of you. You know I'm not going to stop until you've taken your last miserable breath"
25901,Elena, I'm not going to let you do this to me
25902,Connor, Then get rid of me. k*ll yourself. You never wanted to be a vampire in the first place. Now look at what you've become. A monster. And you deserve to die. You don't want to listen to me? Fine
25903,Katherine, Then how about you and I have a little chat
25904,Elena, Katherine?
25905,Katherine, Did you miss me?
25906,Shane, You're looking at what people believe to be the world's first tombstone. This item was donated to Whitmore college last month
25907,April," Oh, I just remembered how I know him. Through my dad"
25908,Matt, That guy knew your dad?
25909,April, Yeah. He taught a theology seminar at Whitmore last year
25910,Shane," ...belonged to a very powerful witch. A witch so powerful, in fact, that Silas... That was his name... Created a spell that would grant him... Immortality. Now legend says that Silas did the spell with the help of a lady witch who loved him, a woman named Qetsiyah. Sadly for Qetsiyah, Silas wanted to give immortality to another woman. So Qetsiyah k*ll her and buried Silas alive, leaving him powerless, immortal, and alone. This might actually be the origin story of hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"
25911,Damon, You got this?
25912,Bonnie, Yeah. I'll bring him to you
25913,Shane," Now it's said that Silas wants to rise again. Regain his power. Wreak havoc on the world. Maybe we should be afraid. Or maybe it's all a bunch of crap and that's just an old rock. All right, listen, enjoy exploring the exhibit. I'll be around to answer any questions. Thank you for coming"
25914,Shane, Hey. You made it
25915,Bonnie, Nice cautionary tale. Qetsiyah sounds like a bad ass
25916,Shane, Nothing compared to Silas
25917,Katherine," Ugh, don't you ever stop crying? Poor Elena, always the v*ctim. Except now you're a k*ll. What does Stefan think of the new you?"
25918,Elena, Shut up
25919,Katherine," The girl he fell in love with is gone, you know. You're like me now. Maybe worse"
25920,Elena, I made a mistake. I can do better
25921,Katherine," No. You can't. You're a vampire. You'll k*ll again. It'll change you, and it'll keep changing you until you're just like me"
25922,Elena, I am nothing like you
25923,Katherine," I was you before you even existed. And when Stefan knew the real me... He hated me. Now he's going to hate you, too. Well, at least you still have Damon"
25924,Elena, Shut up!
25925,Damon," You're missing all the adventure, pal"
25926,Bonnie," Shane, this is my friend Damon. He's kind of an expert on this stuff, too"
25927,Damon, I audited your class. It's very enlightening
25928,Shane," That's right, I remember you. What's your specialty?"
25929,Damon, The origin of the species
25930,Shane," Oh, I think Darwin would arm wrestle you for that distinction"
25931,Damon, Not that species
25932,Shane," You're into the monster stuff. All right, awesome"
25933,Damon, I was kind of hoping that you might have stumbled upon this at some point... Maybe
25934,Shane, This is the hunter's mark. Where did you get this?
25935,Damon, Came to me in a dream. You know anything about the hunter's curse?
25936,Shane," Why, you got a dead hunter in the trunk of your car or something?"
25937,Damon, Metaphorically speaking
25938,Shane," Legend says that if a hunter is k*ll by that which he hunts, then that person will be cursed to walk the earth and torment them till..."
25939,Bonnie, Until...
25940,Shane," Until a new hunter's awakened and their legacy's passed on. They're called ""potentials"""
25941,Shane," Listen, I have a bunch of research on it, why don't I go grab it for you"
25942,Damon," That would be great. Hey, thanks"
25943,Bonnie, How are we supposed to find a potential hunter?
25944,Damon," Yeah, about that..."
25945,Damon, Little Gilbert. Your services are needed
25946,Tyler, Thanks for meeting us
25947,Chris," Yeah, well, make it fast. Klaus will be back soon"
25948,Tyler," No, he won't"
25949,Caroline, Place looks pretty good considering your hybrid got blown up in it
25950,Klaus, Caroline. To what do I owe the pleasure?
25951,Caroline, I want you to give Elena back
25952,Klaus," Ahh. They sent you to sweet talk me. Well, good form, but I'm afraid I can't do it"
25953,Caroline, Why not?
25954,Klaus," She needs my help. Look, I'm not going to burden you with the gory details. I know you have enough on your plate already"
25955,Caroline," That's none of your business, actually"
25956,Klaus," Yes, well, just know that if Tyler was still sired to me, he never would have hurt you. I wouldn't have let him. Can I at least offer you a drink?"
25957,Caroline, Yeah. Thanks
25958,Stefan, All you need to do is give me access to Elena and I'll take it from there
25959,Tyler," Please, man. Help us, and then you can disappear. You'll be free"
25960,Chris," Yeah, until Klaus sends one of his other hybrids after me"
25961,Tyler, Haley and I got your back. We'll make sure nothing happens
25962,Katherine," You were such a good girl when you were a human. Always willing to sacrifice yourself for your friends. Except, weren't they usually the ones that ended up getting hurt?"
25963,Elena, I never wanted that
25964,Katherine," Bonnie lost her grams because of you. Her mom almost turned into a vampire because of you. You know, she probably secretly hates you. Did you ever think of that? I bet she'd be relieved if you were gone"
25965,Elena, I'm not going to k*ll myself
25966,Katherine," Why not? Your very existence brings people nothing but pain. I mean maybe it was worth it when you were worth it. But you're nothing now. You're a monster, Elena. You deserve to die"
25967,Chris, Klaus said you two have to go to Tyler
25968,Hybrid, Why
25969,Chris, Something about his girl Caroline. I'll take over here
25970,Stefan, Elena. Hey
25971,Elena," No. No, no, no"
25972,Stefan," Hey, it's me"
25973,Elena," No, stay... Stay away from me"
25974,Stefan, Let me help you
25975,Stefan," No, Elena, stop!"
25976,Bonnie, How did I not know any of this stuff about Jeremy?
25977,Damon, The witch who loses her powers gets left out of the important conversations
25978,Jeremy, Is everything ok?! Is it Elena?
25979,Bonnie, We figured out how to help her. You need to k*ll a vampire
25980,Jeremy," Oh, great. Give me a stake. I'll k*ll Damon right now"
25981,Damon," Easy, van Helsing. We'll get you one. Don't worry"
25982,Bonnie," Before you do this, you need to know what you're getting yourself into"
25983,Damon," You can rest easy, brother. We figured out how to solve our little Elena problem"
25984,Stefan," Yeah, well, now we have a bigger one. I lost her"
25985,Damon, What? Again?
25986,Stefan," She's in bad shape. I tried to help her, but she attacked me. Listen, you go find her, all right? Talk her down. She'll listen to you. Just tell me what I need to do to end this"
25987,Caroline, So here's the thing. I didn't just come here to try to get you to release Elena
25988,Klaus, You don't say
25989,Caroline," I came here to distract you so that Stefan could go to your house and break her out, which he did. And don't get mad, but then he lost her"
25990,Caroline, Klaus!
25991,Klaus," Caroline. You're beautiful, but if you don't stop talking, I will k*ll you"
25992,Caroline, They figured out how to stop the hallucinations
25993,Klaus, Okay. You have 10 seconds to tell me
25994,Connor, Are you ready to die yet? You know it's your only way out of this
25995,Katherine, You can't take back what you did. It can never be undone. You're a monster and you deserve to die
25996,Miranda," It's ok, sweetie"
25997,Elena, Mom?
25998,Miranda," I know what you're going through. And it's ok. This bridge is... Where your life should have ended. Not just once, but twice. You were ready to die, remember?"
25999,Elena, I don't know what to do
26000,Miranda," Yes, you do, honey. You know exactly what to do"
26001,Miranda," That's right. The sun will come up and this will all be over. It's the right thing to do, Elena. You know it is. Admit it"
26002,Elena, Because I'm a monster. And I deserve to die. I can't do this. I can't leave Jeremy
26003,Miranda, Jeremy is better off without you. Don't you see that?
26004,Elena," But mom, he won't have anyone!"
26005,Miranda," He'll have you. You'll be a ghost who helps him, not a monster who hurts him"
26006,Elena," You're... you're right. I... I... I'm sorry. Mommy, I didn't mean to disappoint you"
26007,Miranda, Oh. You didn't. You were everything I ever wanted you to be. But you died. And you were supposed to stay dead
26008,Damon, Elena
26009,Elena, Damon? How... how did you find me?
26010,Damon, Didn't take a genius to figure it out. The third time's a charm?
26011,Elena," You were right, Damon. Vampires k*ll people. And Stefan was right, too. I can't live with myself"
26012,Damon, Look at you. Being all glass is half empty. Let's just go talk about this before you do something stupid. Okay?
26013,Connor, The sun will be up soon. It's almost over
26014,Damon," Where's your ring? Where's your ring, Elena?"
26015,Tyler," You're doing a good thing, Chris"
26016,Chris," Yeah, well, let's see how fast a good thing could get me out of town"
26017,Haley," Call me when you're safe, ok?"
26018,Chris, Yeah
26019,Klaus, Going somewhere?
26020,Klaus," When I said don't let her out of your sight, what did you think I meant?"
26021,Tyler, It's not his fault! It's mine. I was distracting him. It's my fault she got away!
26022,Klaus, And maybe you should be the one to die for it
26023,Haley, No one has to die!
26024,Klaus, id I not say mind your business?!
26025,Haley, Tyler's covering for me. I'm the one that let her go
26026,Tyler, Haley…
26027,Haley," You want someone dead, go ahead. k*ll me. I'd rather die anyway then end up as one of your sired little bitches"
26028,Klaus," Don't tempt me, little wolf"
26029,Klaus, Your existence is to serve me. To please me. Do you understand?
26030,Chris, I'm sorry. I won't fail you again
26031,Klaus, No. You won't. Get out of here
26032,Haley, No!
26033,Tyler, Jeremy?
26034,Damon, We need to get you inside
26035,Connor, It's almost time
26036,Damon," What you're going through is a curse. We know how to break it, we just have to get you inside!"
26037,Connor, Don't let him stop you. I know you want to. But you can't. Don't
26038,Damon," Damn it, Elena!"
26039,Tyler," What the hell, man?!"
26040,Stefan, I'm sorry
26041,Elena, He's gone
26042,Damon, It's okay
26043,Elena, Damon?
26044,Damon, Fished it out of the river for you. Little tip... Vampires hate to swim. How you feeling?
26045,Elena," My head's clear. I can remember everything, but not like I lived it. Like it was a really bad dream. You saved me. Thank you"
26046,Damon," Well, you know what they say about teenage su1c1de. Don't do it"
26047,Elena, I just can't believe that I almost...
26048,Damon, You weren't yourself
26049,Elena," Yeah, but if it wasn't for you..."
26050,Damon," I'm about to take a very... High and annoying road and tell you something. Because I know that you think Stefan's been lying to you. Which, yeah. He has. But this... rough patch that you two have been going through, it's not what you think. Everything that he's been doing, he's been doing for you. To help you. And after he k*ll me for telling you this, I want you to throw my ashes off of Wickery Bridge, ok? There may be a way out of this for you, Elena. There may be a cure"
26051,Caroline, Tyler
26052,Tyler, It's just us. Paying our respects to Chris
26053,Caroline, Tyler... we didn't have a choice
26054,Tyler," I told him we had his back. I told him if he helped us, he'd be free"
26055,Caroline, We needed to help our friend.
26056,Tyler," Yeah, we helped our friend by handing over another friend"
26057,Caroline, Chris wasn't...
26058,Tyler," Chris was a friend, Caroline. He's like me. He's part of my pack. All he wanted to do was be unsired by that disgusting piece of... How did you even get Klaus to agree to give up one of his hybrids?"
26059,Caroline, I agreed to go on a date with him. I just thought that it might help keep up the ruse between you and Haley
26060,Haley, What the hell is going on?
26061,Tyler, Nothing. Nothing at all. Just celebrating the life of a fallen hybrid friend
26062,Damon, Bourbon. Make that two
26063,Matt," Still saving a spot for Mr. Saltzman, huh?"
26064,Damon, I'd say I'm in the market for a new drinking buddy. You're not qualified
26065,Matt," I know that you don't like me. But I dug up some stuff about the expl*si*n at the Young farm that I kind of need to tell someone about. So April mentioned that her dad knew that professor Shane guy. Which wouldn't be creepy, except he had all that info about the hunter's curse. And we live in a town where, you know, anybody who knows stuff is creepy until proven otherwise"
26066,Damon, You're on the verge of impressing me. Drive it home
26067,Matt," I got the sheriff to dig up the pastor's phone records. Turns out, he made like a call a day to the same number the last month he was alive. And on the day the council got blown up at the farm, he called it ten times. The office of professor Atticus Shane"
26068,Shane," Did your, uh, did your friend Damon, did he get everything he was looking for in my files?"
26069,Bonnie," Yeah. Thanks. I, um... I have to ask, how do you know all this stuff?"
26070,Shane," Bonnie... I have been around the world ten times over. I've studied every supernatural creature known to man. And for the record, witches are hands down the most powerful, so I'm in your corner all the way, I'm your biggest ally. But let me just say one thing. When your new hunter, and I know you have one... When he completes his mark, you're going to want to come to me. 'Cause I'm going to be the only one who can help. Trust me on that, ok? The only one"
26071,Elena, I'm sorry that I stabbed you
26072,Stefan," No, it's all right. I probably deserved it. So, um... Damon told me that he clued you in"
26073,Elena," You didn't k*ll him, did you?"
26074,Stefan," Nah, screw the lies and the secrets. We all want the same thing. We just have to work together for it"
26075,Elena, Stefan... Why did you send Damon to come look for me instead of you?
26076,Stefan, I sent him because lately... It seems like he's able to get through to you in ways that I can't. You listen to him. You trust him. Even when you can't trust me
26077,Elena, I didn't mean to not...
26078,Stefan," Come on, Elena. I mean, after everything that we've been through... You can admit it"
26079,Elena," You have been so strong for me. Helping me. Fighting for that girl that chose you. The girl that I was when I died on the bridge. And I love you so much for wanting to find this cure, because I'd like nothing more than to get her back. Because the... The girl that she's become... That... That I've become, is different. Somehow. Darker. I... Who I am, what I want..."
26080,Stefan, Or... who you want?
26081,Elena, Something's changed... Between Damon and me. Much more than it ever used to be. It's like... It's like everything that I felt for him before I was a vampire...
26082,Stefan, It's been magnified. Your feelings for him have been magnified
26083,Elena, I'm sorry. I don't want to lie to you
26084,Stefan," You know, before, when I was the, uh... The ripper... I understood why you cared for him. I mean, I practically drove you to it. But now... I can't do this, Elena. Not anymore"
26085,Elena, I know
26086,Caroline," What do you mean, you're not coming? I don't need to remind you that your miss Mystic Falls attendance record totally sucks. Besides, you're a founding family member. By definition, you have to be here"
26087,Stefan," Elena and I broke up. By definition, I don't need to be anywhere"
26088,Caroline, Did that sound as depressing to you as it did to me?
26089,Stefan, I'm not depressed. I just want to rip into someone's artery and feed until I can't breathe anymore
26090,Caroline," Well, you can't. As your sober sponsor, I'm not going to let that happen. Try and sublimate"
26091,Stefan, She said she has feelings for Damon
26092,Caroline," What? She can't have feelings for Damon. He's... Damon, and you're you, and I'm... Revolted. You know, I'm gonna talk to her. I'm going to shake some sense into her clearly diseased brain"
26093,Stefan," Yeah, well, I don't know what good that'll do. Elena's right. Being a vampire really has changed her"
26094,Caroline," All the more reason you need to cure her. Look, I got to go. Be careful and remember, there's sublimating and then there's insanity"
26095,Stefan, I'll be fine. Bye
26096,Klaus," In what world do the words ""tell no one"" mean ""tell your brother and every teenage sycophant in town""?"
26097,Stefan, The secret's safe. No one who knows about the cure would endanger us. Trust me. You know I want to find it more than anyone else
26098,Klaus," Well, then I suggest you find some vampires for Jeremy to k*ll before I'm tempted to offer you up as a v*ctim. And try to keep this one to yourself, would you?"
26099,Damon, Where have you been?
26100,Stefan," Oh, you know. Out"
26101,Damon, Where you going?
26102,Damon, Ok. I see shady Stefan is back. Please don't tell me that you're still working with Klaus
26103,Stefan, You obviously haven't heard. Elena and I broke up
26104,Damon," Oh. Got it. Uh, well, I'll be quick, then. So apparently if we want to find the cure, we have to find a vampire hunter who can k*ll enough vampires to reveal the map on the hunter's Mark. Now, unless we want Jeremy to go all Connor 2.0, I suggest we find a different hunter"
26105,Stefan, Ok. And?
26106,Damon," And I was gonna ask Professor Shane, but it turns out he's shadier than you are. Matt Donovan connected him and the pastor through phone records. Apparently the two were very chatty the day that the pastor blew up the council"
26107,Stefan," Ah. So you're gonna confront Shane, threaten him, possibly k*ll him... that sort of thing?"
26108,Damon," Yeah, unless he tells me what he's up to. What do you say? We tag team?"
26109,Stefan, Nah. I'd say you're on your own
26110,Damon," Or we could just blow it off, then... go get drunk, brother-Bond over some tridelts if you... You know, want some quality time"
26111,Stefan, Let's not pretend like this isn't the best day of your life
26112,Caroline," I'm your best friend, and I would never pick sides, but are you sure that this is what you want? Because Stefan is your soul mate. Sorry. Picking sides"
26113,Elena," It's not like I don't love Stefan anymore, but I can't deny that ever since I turned, my feelings for Damon have become more intense"
26114,Caroline," Yeah, I know. Stefan filled me in on all the gory Damon details"
26115,Elena, He did? Is he ok?
26116,Caroline, No. He's heartbroken
26117,Elena," Well, what was I supposed to do? Lie to him?"
26118,Caroline," No, but you weren't supposed to let Damon weasel his way into your confused newbie vampire heart"
26119,Elena," Well, he did, and that's exactly what I am... confused. I need to figure out what these feelings actually mean"
26120,Shane, Excuse me. I'm a little lost. I'm here to interview contestants
26121,Elena, You're Professor Shane?
26122,Shane," Yeah, that's right... Professor by day, pageant judge by other day. In spite of being absurdly unqualified, I'm apparently awarding a scholarship?"
26123,Caroline, Inside by the parlor
26124,Shane, Right here?
26125,Caroline, Mm-hmm
26126,Shane, All right. I'll just follow the scent of hair spray and world domination
26127,Elena, He's the one who told Damon how to break the hunter's curse
26128,Caroline, He's also the one that has Bonnie so obsessed with practicing magic that she bailed on pageant prep
26129,Elena, And now he's judging miss Mystic Falls? Jack of all trades or kind of creepy?
26130,Matt, So your sister's making me be her date. Do I have to do that weird dance thing?
26131,Jeremy, I'm pretty sure that's just for the contestants
26132,Matt, I heard that you're April's escort. How'd that happen?
26133,Jeremy," She needed a date, and apparently you were taken"
26134,Matt," Uh. Ok, let's just take these, and we'll come back for the kegs"
26135,Jeremy, Wait. You want to see something cool?
26136,Matt, How did you just do that?
26137,Jeremy," I've had all this energy, like all the time"
26138,Matt," Jer, I think you need to talk to someone about this. I mean, look what happened to Connor, ok? A byproduct of this energy is that you're gonna want to k*ll vampires, and you happen to live with one"
26139,Jeremy," Hey, I would never hurt my sister. I'll be fine"
26140,Guard, Can I help you?
26141,Stefan, Time for a little break. He'll be safe with me
26142,Patient, Who are you?
26143,Stefan, Why is there a cop outside?
26144,Patient, I'm a convicted m*rder
26145,Stefan, Are you guilty?
26146,Patient, Of course I am
26147,Stefan, Any regrets?
26148,Patient, Only that I got caught
26149,Caroline," Whoa. Stop. Stop. Those flowers go in the back, as indicated by the floral chart that you guys had plenty of time to memorize. Yeah. Thank you"
26150,Klaus," Now, how did I know I'd find you at the helm of this ship? Go away. I'm busy"
26151,Caroline, Go away. I'm busy
26152,Klaus, I was wondering what time I should pick you up tomorrow
26153,Caroline, About a quarter to never
26154,Klaus, I was promised a date in return for one of my hybrids
26155,Caroline," Yes, a date, like to a movie, where we don't have to talk and I can put at least 3 seats between us"
26156,Klaus, Surely the reigning miss Mystic Falls won't be hosting the party alone. And I assume you're not taking Tyler... not after his indiscretions with his lady werewolf friend
26157,Caroline," Fine. If you insist on coming, meet me here, 2 P.M. black tie optional. And I already have a dress, so don't even think of getting me so much as a corsage. You understand?"
26158,Klaus," I'll see you tomorrow, Caroline"
26159,Haley, Scream. Let it out. We're on an abandoned farm. No one can hear you for Miles
26160,Hybrid," Easy for you to say, wolf girl. You never turned 20 times in a row"
26161,Haley," No, but I watched a bunch of your hybrid friends go through it"
26162,Hybrid, Why does it have to be like this? Uhh! Why break every bone over and over?
26163,Haley, That's what the sire Bond is. You're grateful to Klaus because he released you from the pain of having to turn every full moon. So you're gonna keep turning until it doesn't hurt. Then you'll have nothing to be grateful for
26164,Hybrid, Uh! What's in all this for you?
26165,Haley, I don't hear bones cracking
26166,Tyler, Caroline bought us another day. Klaus wants to go with her to miss mystic falls tomorrow
26167,Haley, So does that mean we're going?
26168,Tyler," Watching Klaus Fawn over Caroline at some lame-ass pageant? No, thanks"
26169,Haley," Come on. We need to hide what's going on here by pretending that I was the one that broke you two up, and besides, isn't it at your house?"
26170,Hybrid," Guys, like this isn't torture enough? Can you take it outside?"
26171,Tyler, Fine. We'll go. Wear a dress
26172,Jeremy, You need a hand?
26173,Elena, Yeah. Please. This clasp is tricky
26174,Elena," Hey, I, uh, picked up your clothes from the dry cleaners. They should be hanging on your door"
26175,Jeremy, I really wish you'd stop acting like you were still my sister
26176,Matt," How do you wake up with a kn*fe in your hand and not remember how it got there? It's that hunter's Mark, jer. It's messing with you"
26177,Jeremy," What if I'm turning into Alaric? I probably died too many times with this ring on my finger, and I'm developing an alter ego, like he did"
26178,Matt," ""Newly awakened hunters may not be fully conscious of their actions. Their subconscious pushes through until the urge becomes a basic instinct."" You're not having a psychotic break, jer. You either tell Elena, or I will"
26179,Jeremy, Fine. I'll tell her when I see her
26180,Matt, All right. We should probably get going. Need a ride?
26181,Jeremy," Uh, no. Go ahead. I'll meet you there"
26182,Matt, All right
26183,Elena, Blue
26184,Caroline, Blue
26185,April, Really? The blue seems a little safe
26186,Elena, Safe is good when it comes to the judges
26187,Caroline, She's right. Gracie Lockwood had a 3-foot slit her year and practically got laughed off the court
26188,Damon, She got my vote
26189,Caroline," Get out, lurker"
26190,Damon, Ouch. Where's Professor Shane?
26191,Caroline, Check the judges' table
26192,Damon," Red one, definitely"
26193,Caroline, We've already agreed that the red one's a little bit too showy
26194,Damon, It's a pageant. That's the whole point
26195,Caroline, Did you win miss mystic last year? No. I don't think you did
26196,Damon," Neither did Elena, and she wore blue"
26197,Caroline, Nobody cares what you think
26198,April, I care
26199,Damon," See? April cares. Red, right, Elena?"
26200,Elena, The red is pretty
26201,Damon, And my work here is done
26202,Caroline," Uh, what happened to 30 seconds ago when you hated the red one? What happened to ""safe is good""?"
26203,Elena," Whichever one you want to wear, April"
26204,Caroline, What just happened?
26205,Elena, Damon
26206,Damon, Still here
26207,Elena, We need to talk
26208,Damon," Stefan told me about the breakup. I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not"
26209,Elena, What did he say?
26210,Damon," Oh, you know. Stuff. The guy just went on and on about it. Wouldn't shut up"
26211,Elena, So he didn't tell you why?
26212,Damon," Nope, but I'm sure it has something to do with you acting weird, so why don't you tell me?"
26213,Elena, You
26214,Shane, Damon Salvatore. Looks like we're traveling the same circuit
26215,Damon, Professor Shane. Just the guy I wanted to see
26216,Damon, So I'm in search of another hunter
26217,Shane," Hunter with a capital ""h""? Why?"
26218,Damon," Same reason anyone needs a hunter... loneliness, drinking buddy, fourth for golf"
26219,Shane, I thought you said you already had a potential
26220,Damon," I did, but he ended up being potentially a problem, so..."
26221,Shane, There's nothing I can do to help you
26222,Damon," Hmm. Well, why don't you help me with this? Why are you here? What's in your little lesson plan there, Professor?"
26223,Shane," You think too highly of me, Damon. I'm gonna go find the other judges"
26224,Damon," Hey, no pity votes for April young, ok? I mean, just because her dad blew up a house with a dozen people in it doesn't mean she should get a tiara. But you knew him, didn't you? Because I hear you two racked up a pretty impressive phone bill"
26225,Shane," If you want to know something about me, Damon, just ask"
26226,Damon, Okay. How did you convince the pastor to k*ll all those people?
26227,Shane, Did you just accuse me of mass m*rder in the middle of a High School pageant?
26228,Carol, Welcome to this season's miss Mystic Falls. We are so excited to showcase our most outstanding community leaders in the making
26229,Jeremy, What am I doing here?
26230,Stefan, Getting the chance to make your sister human again. You interested?
26231,Jeremy, You have no idea
26232,Stefan," Actually, I do"
26233,Jeremy, Who is that?
26234,Stefan," Oh, it doesn't really matter. All that matters is that you're a vampire hunter and he's a vampire. Well, almost"
26235,Jeremy, Was this all so I could stake him?
26236,Stefan," Do you think I want to do this, Jeremy? Look at me. I hate this. I don't want to do this, but your sister isn't supposed to be a vampire, and we need to help her. He's a m*rder, and he will gladly k*ll again, so do it, Jeremy. k*ll him"
26237,Jeremy," Stefan, what are you doing?! What the hell is wrong with you?"
26238,Stefan," Do it, Jeremy, or I will rip the chains off for real. Do it!"
26239,Stefan," All right, enough. He's dead"
26240,Caroline," Hey, why am I bussing your tables? I said no empty glasses"
26241,Caroline," Will you guys pick up the tempo? This is a pageant, not a funeral"
26242,Klaus, And how am I doing?
26243,Caroline," You're... perfect. Just so beyond annoying, I can't even look at you"
26244,Klaus," They didn't waste any time, did they?"
26245,Caroline, Let's just get today over with
26246,Haley, I can't believe that I won. I just want to thank the judges for seeing past the fact that I'm a raging bitch
26247,Tyler, You don't want to do that. Those girls will cut you. They have nails
26248,Haley, I have claws
26249,Caroline," Hi, everyone. I'm Caroline Forbes. As the reigning miss Mystic Falls, it is my honor to introduce this year's miss mystic court!"
26250,Caroline," We begin the procession with Valerie fell, accompanied by Dylan Clark"
26251,Caroline," Next we have Amber Wolverton, accompanied by Hector Linsey. And here's Michelle Cunningham..."
26252,Matt, Have you seen Jeremy?
26253,Elena, He's probably with the escorts
26254,Matt, Caroline told me to wrangle the escorts. He's not here. Did he tell you about his nightmares?
26255,Elena, What nightmares?
26256,Matt, The ones where he k*ll you
26257,Caroline," Katherine Wilson, accompanied by Eric Hanson"
26258,Elena," I'll find him, but... April's about to get abandoned"
26259,Matt, I got this
26260,Caroline, And finally...
26261,Elena, Thanks
26262,Caroline," And finally... We have a last-minute entry... April young, accompanied by Jeremy Gilbert"
26263,Matt, Jeremy's running late
26264,April, I guess you'll do
26265,Matt, You lead
26266,Caroline," Hey, what's with the last-minute escort change? .Where is Jeremy?"
26267,Elena, I'm calling him right now. He's not picking up
26268,Damon, Do the math. Emo teen. Open bar. It's fine
26269,Elena, Matt said that Jeremy's been having nightmares about k*ll vampires and he's been hiding it from me
26270,Damon, Relax. I'm sure he's fine
26271,Elena, I don't know. I have a bad feeling
26272,Damon," If I'm not worried, you shouldn't be worried. Let it go. I'll go look for him"
26273,Elena, Okay
26274,Caroline, Ok. You go home. I'm gonna start asking around here
26275,Elena, Maybe Damon's right. Maybe he grabbed a bottle from the bar and snuck off to the woods
26276,Caroline," No. Damon's never right. Damon is sneaky and manipulative and rude, but he's never right. How can you not see that?"
26277,Elena," I don't know, but why do I think that you won't hesitate to tell me?"
26278,Caroline," Fine. Friend-tervention. I think your so-called feelings for Damon are really starting to cloud your judgment, and I don't like it, and the thought of you two together really makes me want to barf"
26279,Klaus," Easy, love. You're making a scene"
26280,Elena," Wow. Caroline, thank you for making this very difficult time so much easier"
26281,Caroline, How did I become the bad guy?
26282,Klaus, Let's get you a drink. I'll tell you all about being the bad guy
26283,Damon, Please don't tell me that you've roped Jeremy into a world of crazy
26284,Stefan, I had no choice. Elena needs a cure
26285,Damon," Oh, right. So you can turn her back into the girl who's still in love with you"
26286,Stefan," You know, I get why you wouldn't want to believe it, Damon, but she isn't herself anymore"
26287,Damon," Of course you would think that. Leave it alone, Stefan"
26288,Stefan, How far did the Mark grow? Show me on this drawing
26289,Jeremy," Sorry, Stefan. I can't trust you"
26290,Stefan," How far is it, Jeremy?"
26291,Jeremy, I said I can't
26292,Stefan," Answer me, or I will make you answer me"
26293,Jeremy, I'm not telling you anything
26294,Stefan, What does the mark look like?
26295,Jeremy, I guess I can't be compelled anymore
26296,Caroline," It's just, as her best friend, it is my duty to warn her when she's making a giant mistake, right? And now she's taking Damon's side on everything. "
26297,Klaus, So being a vampire has changed her
26298,Caroline, But being a vampire only amplifies who you already are. It doesn't turn you into a completely different person
26299,Klaus, Very peculiar
26300,Caroline, What's that look for?
26301,Klaus, It'll all make sense eventually
26302,Caroline, Whatever. Just hurry up and find the cure
26303,Klaus, I'm working on it
26304,Caroline, Would you ever take it?
26305,Klaus," Now, why would I want to cure myself of being the most powerful creature on the planet, hmm?"
26306,Caroline, So there's not one single moment in your whole life that you wanted to be human
26307,Klaus," How about you? Life used to be a lot easier. Don't you miss the days of being... ""Chair of the Mystic Falls beautification committee"" and the ""director of the policemen's yearly raffle""?"
26308,Caroline, Is that my miss mystic application? Where did you get that?
26309,Klaus," ""When I am chosen, I intend to redefine excellence""... Now, I'm really enjoying your use of ""when"" here. It's very confident. And above all, I promise to aspire, inspire, and perspire."" Obviously, we found a shortage of words ending in ""spire."""
26310,Caroline, Yeah. It's very funny. It's hilarious. Just...
26311,Damon," Oh, hey. How do those two know each other?"
26312,Tyler, They don't. Paranoid much?
26313,Damon," The council just got b*rned to a crisp. Some mysterious hunters just blew through town, and this guy just happens to know everything about everything. Yes, paranoid"
26314,April," Hey, where have you been?"
26315,Jeremy," Hey, sorry. I got stuck at work"
26316,April," Jeremy, if you were too chicken to do the dance thingy, then you should've just told me"
26317,Jeremy," No, no. I knew the dance. I watched some lesson online, like, 100 times"
26318,April, You did?
26319,Jeremy," Hey, what's that Shane guy doing here?"
26320,April," He's a judge. I talked to him about my dad. I mean, he said that he never seemed depressed or suicidal or anything, so..."
26321,Jeremy, Your dad?
26322,April," Yeah. You know, I figured I'd explore every possibility, even the bleak ones. What are you looking at?"
26323,Jeremy, Your dad was doing the right thing for this town. The whole council was. They died heroes
26324,Shane," Oh, you again. I must be the least intimidating mass m*rder ever"
26325,Damon," Well, you still never gave me a name, and it's kind of urgent"
26326,Shane," Listen. There is no other name. Look. At any given moment, there are 5 hunters in existence, all right? Most of them have no idea who they are or what their purpose is. Means finding more than one in a lifetime is next to impossible. Heh. Subtle"
26327,Damon," Like you didn't already know. You have 5 seconds to give me another name, or you die"
26328,Shane," You know, since it's generally unwise for a vampire to seek out a hunter, it means you're interested in the mark. That's probably because of where it leads, but here's the thing. Even if you complete the mark and you get the map, the thing that you're looking for is sealed with a spell only a certain kind of witch can perform"
26329,Damon, What kind of witch?
26330,Shane," Come on, Damon"
26331,Damon, I love pressure points. What kind of witch?
26332,Shane, Come on. You're a big boy. You can figure this one out
26333,Damon, A Bennett witch
26334,Shane," Aren't too many of those lying around, as I'm sure you know. So none of this matter until Bonnie is back in touch with her magic. Between the two of us, who do you think she trusts to help her get there? 5 seconds are up unless you just realized you need me alive. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a scholarship to award"
26335,Carol," And now the moment you've been waiting for. Caroline, would you do the honors?"
26336,Caroline, This year's miss Mystic Falls is... April young
26337,Elena," Hey, where have you been? What are you doing with that? Put it down"
26338,Jeremy, Connor was right. All I can think about is k*ll vampires
26339,Elena, You're nothing like Connor
26340,Jeremy," I want to believe that, and I know I don't want to hurt you, but everything inside of me is telling me to drive this stake through your heart"
26341,Elena," Why would you say that? It's me, Jeremy"
26342,Jeremy, And you're a vampire
26343,Elena," Yeah, but I'm also your sister. I would never do anything to hurt you. Get it away from me"
26344,Elena," Jere... Jeremy. Jer, wake up. Please wake up"
26345,Matt, Jeremy!
26346,Matt," Jeremy, you don't want to do this, ok? That's your sister. It's that stupid Mark on your arm"
26347,Jeremy," Shut up, Matt!"
26348,Matt," Jeremy, look at me. I'm human, and I'm telling you not to hurt her"
26349,Stefan," Get out of here, Matt!"
26350,Stefan, Let me do it. Let me do it. Let me do it
26351,Haley, Your mom parties harder than you do. Does she have the gene?
26352,Tyler, Dad. What about your parents?
26353,Haley," Never met them. My adoptive parents found out about my wolf gene when I did, the night that I turned and tore apart their living room. Promptly kicked me out"
26354,Tyler, You never told me how it triggered
26355,Haley," You mean, who I k*ll? Boating accident. We were drunk. I thought I wasn't"
26356,Tyler," So what's with you chatting up all these old-timers, huh... my mom, that Professor guy"
26357,Haley," That Professor guy is, like, 30, and he's hot and smart"
26358,Tyler, You know him or something?
26359,Haley, No. I just met him. Why?
26360,Tyler, No reason
26361,Klaus," I never answered your question, if I'd ever thought about being human. Once. I was on a trek in the Andes, and a hummingbird flew up to me and just hovered there staring at me. Its tiny heart was pattering like a machine g*n... And I thought, ""What a thing, you know, to have to work that hard every day just to stay alive, to be constantly on the verge of death,"" and how satisfying every day must be that it survived... And that was the only time I thought about being human"
26362,Haley, What's he saying?
26363,Tyler," A bunch of bs about being human. The sooner we get rid of this guy, the better"
26364,Stefan," Elena, wait"
26365,Elena, I have to find Jeremy. This shouldn't be happening to him
26366,Stefan," Elena, wait. It's my fault"
26367,Elena, What are you talking about?
26368,Stefan," I'm starting to think that when a hunter k*ll a vampire, their urge to keep k*ll grows stronger"
26369,Elena," Tell me that Jeremy hasn't been with you this entire time. Tell me that you haven't been making him k*ll vampires, Stefan"
26370,Stefan, We need the map to get the cure
26371,Elena," If getting my humanity back means stripping Jeremy of his, then I don't want the cure"
26372,Stefan, He's the only way to fix all of this
26373,Elena," You mean me, the only way to fix me. You don't have to love me like this. This is who I am now. The old Elena died when she went off that bridge. Let her go"
26374,Matt, What are you doing?
26375,Jeremy, I can't keep living here if I want to k*ll my sister
26376,Matt, Elena knows that. That's why she moved out and asked me to move in
26377,Jeremy, What?
26378,Matt," Look, I'm not one of them, Jer. I'll keep an eye on you, and we can keep this hunter business in check"
26379,Jeremy, Where's Elena gonna go?
26380,Elena, I can't stay at home anymore
26381,Stefan, Pick a room. I'll crash somewhere else
26382,Hybrid," Tell me it's over, Ty. I really don't think I can do this anymore"
26383,Tyler, It's over. Nice work. We are one step closer to ending this
26384,Haley, We got another one
26385,Shane, Good. We're almost ready
26386,Haley, I want to leave Tyler out of this when it all goes down
26387,Shane, We'll talk when you've broken the last
26388,Elena," Ah, thanks"
26389,Damon, Just being polite. Thought you hated whiskey
26390,Elena, My brother wants to k*ll me
26391,Damon, Welcome to the club
26392,Elena," Jeremy can't live with me, Stefan wants to fix me, and Caroline flat out admitted that she doesn't like me this way. Think it's safe to say that I'm not so great at this vampire thing"
26393,Damon, You want to know what I think? I don't think I've ever seen you more alive
26394,Elena, That dance that they did today kind of reminded me of when...
26395,Damon, when we danced together?
26396,Elena, I wanted to dance with you today
26397,Stefan, Elena is right. I just need to let go
26398,Caroline," No. You're right, Stefan. It's not pretty, and it's not easy, but you can't give up on her"
26399,Stefan," Caroline, she looked me in the eye, and she told me to move on"
26400,Caroline," She's lost, ok? You and her... epic. Her and Damon... ugh, God. There's something wrong with her. Just promise me you won't stop looking for the cure"
26401,Stefan," Klaus won't let me, even if I wanted to"
26402,Caroline, What does he care? He doesn't even want it
26403,Stefan, He wants to keep Elena human so that he can make more hybrids
26404,Caroline," He's gonna need them. Tyler has almost got all of them unsired. Oh, my God. Oh… My… God. Ugh. I was trying to understand why Klaus was so intrigued by Damon and Elena. He said I would figure it out. This is what he was talking about"
26405,Stefan, What are you talking about?
26406,Caroline," Think about it. Every time Elena has had a problem, Damon has been the magic solution. Today Elena was worried about Jeremy. Who swoops in and tells her to relax? Damon and she listens. When Elena started feeding, who said that she could only drink bl*od straight from the vein?"
26407,Stefan, Damon
26408,Caroline, And when she tried to drink from animals?
26409,Stefan, Couldn't keep it down
26410,Caroline, And bl*od bags?
26411,Stefan, Same thing
26412,Caroline," Name one vampire in the history of vampires who couldn't drink bl*od from a bl*od bag. Damon said she couldn't, so she couldn't. Damon likes the red dress, Elena likes the red dress"
26413,Stefan," Damon says k*ll Connor, she k*ll Connor"
26414,Caroline," What if it's possible? Damon's bl*od made her a vampire, right? It's rare but it happens. What if this is really happening?"
26415,Stefan, Elena is sired to Damon
26416,Damon, Elena?
26417,Elena, Hey
26418,Damon, Thought you might have left
26419,Elena, No. I don't have to be at school for... At least 20 minutes ago. What's that face?
26420,Damon, What face?
26421,Elena, That face
26422,Damon, I'm happy
26423,Caroline, This is a disaster
26424,Stefan, Look. We don't know anything for sure
26425,Caroline," Yes, we do. Elena is sired to Damon, which means her one singular burning desire is to make him happy, just like Klaus and his hybrids"
26426,Stefan, No. It's not. A vampire sired to another vampire is one in a million. Maybe it won't affect her the same way
26427,Caroline," We already know it's affecting her. She's become Damon's lapdog. It's true. Everything he says, she agrees with. Everything he asks her to do, she does. We need to do something"
26428,Stefan," Wait. No. Hold on. Caroline, this isn't gossip. You can't just drop this on her before we know what's happening for sure"
26429,Caroline," I need to talk to Tyler, ok? Maybe he'll know what to do. All right"
26430,Stefan," Talk to Tyler, but please don't tell anyone else. If this is true, then it may have influence Elena's every action and emotion since she became a vampire"
26431,Adrian," Please, no more. I can't"
26432,Tyler," Yes, you can. Block out the pain"
26433,Kim, That's enough. This is torture
26434,Haley," Kim, stop. He needs to finish"
26435,Kim," Not today, he doesn't"
26436,Haley," Yes today. Nate, Dean, and Chris are all dead, which makes Adrian Klaus' right hand. We can't let Adrian anywhere near Klaus until his sire bond is completely broken"
26437,Tyler," Haley is right. The bond isn't broken until he doesn't feel the pain of transformation anymore. If we want to get back at Klaus for everything he's done to us, Adrian has to keep turning"
26438,Kim," He doesn't have to do anything. Isn't that the point of breaking the sire bond... Free will? Let's go, Adrian"
26439,Damon, I got it. Ahem. Scarf. What... oh
26440,Elena," Listen, Damon. We need to..."
26441,Damon," No. No, no, no. Don't ruin it"
26442,Elena, You don't even know what I was gonna say
26443,Damon," Well, I'm assuming it starts with, ""what are we?"" And then ends with going to tell Stefan"
26444,Elena, He should know
26445,Damon, I know he should know. Just don't know when he should know it
26446,Elena," Well, he knows that something is going on between us. I mean, it's the reason that he and I broke up"
26447,Damon," Yeah, but can't we just let ourselves enjoy one secret, selfish day before we destroy his?"
26448,Elena, Maybe we shouldn't...
26449,Damon," No, Elena. This is our time. It's never been right before, and it's right now. Just one day. One day"
26450,Elena, Ok. One day
26451,Damon, Yes!
26452,Elena, Hey
26453,Stefan, Hey
26454,Elena, See you in history?
26455,Stefan, Yeah. Listen. We need to talk
26456,Damon," Sired? Really, Stefan? That is the most pathetic nonsense I've ever heard come out of your mouth, and you've said some crap in your day"
26457,Stefan," It was your bl*od that turned her, right? I mean, she's been different since day one because of you. You can't deny that"
26458,Damon, Sure I can. I finally got Elena to a good place about being a vampire. You two idiots can't stand that she's happy because of me
26459,Stefan, All right. You know what? Prove me wrong. Tell her it's ok to drink from a bl*od bag
26460,Damon, She can't. Her weird doppelganger body rejected the bl*od from the bag
26461,Stefan," Right, because you told her to. You said she had to drink warm human bl*od straight from the vein. She almost died to make you happy. Look. Just ask her to drink from a bl*od bag. Make sure you tell her how happy you'll be if it works, and if I'm wrong, I'll be the first to apologize"
26462,Damon," When her body rejects this bl*od, which it will, your apology better be epic"
26463,Bonnie," Elena, hey, is everything ok?"
26464,Elena, Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
26465,Bonnie," Well, Caroline told me you had to move out to stay away from Jeremy"
26466,Elena, Matt is at the house staying with him right now to make sure he keeps all of his hunter stuff in control. He's ok
26467,Caroline," But are you? I mean, clearly, they don't have a flat iron at hotel Salvatore"
26468,Elena, Oh. I was in a rush. I mean... look. Do you girls have any plans tonight? I'm in desperate need of some girl talk
26469,Bonnie, I'm in. Shane taught me some small spells I've been wanting to try
26470,Caroline," Oh, creepy Professor guy is just Shane now"
26471,Bonnie, He's not creepy
26472,Elena, We're not judging
26473,Caroline, I am
26474,Elena, Don't listen to her. So girls' night? We can raid the Salvatore wine cellar
26475,Caroline, Are you sure that Stefan and Damon are cool with us crashing at their place?
26476,Elena," I can't go home because my brother is trying to k*ll me. So their place is mine now, too. I'll see you in a bit"
26477,Elena," You being here makes your selfish, secret day a little difficult, don't you think?"
26478,Damon, Ha ha! Forget your lunch
26479,Elena, I can't. You know I can't
26480,Damon," Well, last time you tried it, the circumstances were less than optimal, and I think maybe you should just give it another try, see if it works. I really think it will. Please... for me?"
26481,Damon, You ok?
26482,Elena," Um... I'm fine. It tastes like bl*od. Last time, it was like hot garbage"
26483,Damon, You sure you're ok?
26484,Elena," I'm better than ok. I mean, maybe last time, it was a bad batch or something. I can't believe this, Damon. I don't have to hurt people anymore. I have to get to class. Thank you"
26485,Shane," Trespassing, breaking and entering, all before noon?"
26486,Haley, Having trouble breaking Adrian. Don't worry about it
26487,Shane, You already got the 12 hybrids I need
26488,Haley," We have 11. I told you, Tyler Lockwood isn't part of the deal"
26489,Shane," Well, now there's 11 hybrids. You deliver me 12 without loyalties to Klaus, or your friend Tyler becomes fair game"
26490,Haley, You haven't held up your end of the bargain
26491,Shane," Right. This is everything you always wanted to know about your biological parents, and it's encoded in case you're thinking of the smash and grab. Just bring me 12 unsired hybrids, and it's yours"
26492,Caroline, I talked to Tyler
26493,Stefan, And?
26494,Caroline," The sire bound exists because the hybrids are grateful to Klaus for relieving them from the pain of having to wolf out every full moon, and that's why they have to turn until they're not ruled by the pain anymore"
26495,Stefan," Right, but Elena is not a werewolf. So what's the vampire equivalent?"
26496,Caroline," Well, that's the problem. There isn't one"
26497,Stefan, What are you doing?
26498,Damon, Elena is sired. You were right. I was wrong. Happy?
26499,Stefan," No. I'm not happy, but what are we gonna do about it?"
26500,Damon," Well, I'm working on it. Here. Remember that?"
26501,Stefan, New Orleans
26502,Damon," 1942, to be exact"
26503,Stefan, What was in New Orleans in 1942?
26504,Damon," Other that bourbon and beads, us, Stefan"
26505,Stefan," Oh, yeah. What was the name of that girl you used to hang out with?"
26506,Damon, That was no ordinary girl. That was Charlotte
26507,Damon," She was crazy about me from the minute we met. So, of course, when she asked me to turn her into a vampire, I did"
26508,Damon, Hi
26509,Charlotte, Hey
26510,Damon, So did you decide who you would like to have for dinner tonight?
26511,Charlotte, Him
26512,Charlotte, He looks tasty
26513,Damon," That's a very fine choice, Miss Charlotte. I will go set that up. Now, if anyone tries to touch my drink, you show them no mercy, ok?"
26514,Damon, Drop by after your set. Come join us
26515,Charlotte, You spilled my man's drink
26516,Navy Sailor, Sorry. It's crowded in here
26517,Charlotte, That's no excuse
26518,Navy Sailor," Hey, take it easy, lady"
26519,Charlotte, I'm not gonna take it easy
26520,Damon, What did you do?
26521,Charlotte, He touched your drink. You said show no mercy. I thought you'd be happy
26522,Damon, That was my first clue
26523,Stefan," She was sired to you, and I can only assume you took full advantage of that until you got bored of her, right?"
26524,Damon," More like when she went all ""fatal attraction"" on me. Then I had to make a clean break"
26525,Stefan, How'd you do that?
26526,Stefan, Who's Valérie la marche?
26527,Damon," The witch that I found to help me break little Charlotte's sire bond. Pack your bags, baby bro. We're going to Bourbon Street"
26528,Elena," One for you, one for you"
26529,Bonnie, I'm assuming this is for Caroline
26530,Elena," Actually, it's for me"
26531,Bonnie," Oh, I thought..."
26532,Caroline, Are you saying that...
26533,Elena," Thanks to Damon, I am now a functional dysfunctional vampire"
26534,Bonnie, That's amazing
26535,Caroline," What do you mean, thanks to Damon?"
26536,Elena," Well, he suggested that I try it again. So I did, and it worked. No more snatch, eat, and erase"
26537,Caroline, So where is my least favorite Salvatore?
26538,Elena," ""Out with Stefan for the night. Don't wait up. Brother bonding."""
26539,Caroline, Hmm. So you guys check-in text now? What else do you do?
26540,Elena," I know that you're not the biggest fan, but he kind of just changed my life. Do you mind laying off on all the hate?"
26541,Bonnie," Ok. New girls' night rule... No boy talks, yeah? Plus, why talk when we have this?"
26542,Caroline, Is that stoner tea?
26543,Bonnie, It's spirit tea. It opens up your chi or whatever. Come on. It's not drugs. Shane is helping me do natural magic without having to access the spirits
26544,Caroline, Mm-hmm
26545,Bonnie, Don't judge
26546,Caroline," Ok. Fine. I hereby vow not to be judgmental for the rest of the evening. Even if you two are potentially ruining your lives as I stand idly by, it's your choice"
26547,Elena, I'll drink to that
26548,Stefan," Well, the city is the same, just brighter"
26549,Damon, Have you been back here since '42?
26550,Stefan," Nope, not since I shipped off to join the w*r effort and you didn't"
26551,Damon, Somebody had to entertain the ladies who had been left by their menfolk
26552,Damon, Elena is at the house with the girls where she can't get in trouble. Bad news... think they got into the dom. Told her to make herself at home
26553,Stefan," Yeah. You told her, so she does, right?"
26554,Damon," Sire bond is not that literal, Stefan"
26555,Stefan," Really? Name one thing that you've asked her to do that you haven't gotten, huh?"
26556,Damon," You know what I haven't gotten? Blame, guilt. I get it, Stefan. I get that you're pissed that Elena dumped you because she has feelings for me. Bet you blame the sire bond for that, too"
26557,Stefan, Yeah. You know what? I absolutely do
26558,Damon," Why, because it's impossible to think she could have feelings for me?"
26559,Stefan," No, because it's impossible for her to be so blind that she doesn't see how wrong you are for her"
26560,Stefan," Hey, wait, Damon. I'm sorry"
26561,Damon, What'd you say?
26562,Stefan," ""I'm sorry I blame you for my bloodlust and for me becoming a ripper. It wasn't your fault."" Do I really have to say it wasn't his fault?"
26563,Lexi, Yes. Keep going
26564,Stefan," ""You're the only brother I have, and I hope that we can be friends again."""
26565,Lexi," Perfect. Now, just remember, we're here to talk to Damon, not to yell, not to dredge up the past, and most definitely not to pick a fight"
26566,Stefan," That's the real trick, isn't it?"
26567,Lexi, You've spent the last 20 years turning your life around. It's time to make nice with your brother
26568,Damon, You look like a guy I used to know
26569,Stefan," Hello, Damon"
26570,Damon, Come to put a stake in my heart?
26571,Stefan, More like bury the hatchet
26572,Damon," Egypt, ah. Finally gonna get to see the pyramids"
26573,Stefan," Oh, I doubt I'll be doing much sightseeing driving an ambulance through the front lines, but... yeah, yeah... Egypt"
26574,Damon, Think they have room for another driver? I could handle some w*r if it meant spending quality time with my little brother
26575,Stefan, Tell you what. I'll talk to my C.O
26576,Lexi, You're not going
26577,Damon, I don't like you
26578,Lexi," In 1912, you pressured Stefan to drink human bl*od. He's been trying to put his ripper days behind him, but he needs to see death and bl*od and deal with them as a part of life. He needs balance, restraint"
26579,Damon, What makes you think I'm not balanced and restrained?
26580,Lexi," The fact that you never have been. You think of what you want first, second, and third. Stefan is better off alone than in your company"
26581,Damon," Well, I beg to differ"
26582,Stefan, To the Salvatore's in Egypt
26583,Damon, Cheers
26584,Stefan, Cheers
26585,Lexi, Cheers
26586,Charlotte, Damon… Did you forget you were supposed to meet us for dinner?
26587,Damon, Sorry. I lost track of time
26588,Charlotte, I brought you leftovers
26589,Damon, Charlotte!
26590,Lexi, Get away from him
26591,Damon, Stefan... Stefan. I... I... Stefan...
26592,Lexi," She's better off without you, too"
26593,Stefan," I apologize, all right? As much as I hate this sire bond thing, I shouldn't take it out on you. It's not really your fault"
26594,Damon," Well, don't get all warm and fuzzy on me yet. It's where the witch lived"
26595,Stefan," What, you weren't expecting to find the same exact witch in the same place"
26596,Damon," No, but since I couldn't remember where the store was, figured I'd get us a start"
26597,Stefan, Maybe there's another place to start. You think Charlotte might be in New Orleans?
26598,Damon," Yeah, maybe"
26599,Stefan, Where's the last place you saw her?
26600,Damon, Corner of Bourbon and Dumaine. Kind of told her to count every brick in every building in New Orleans and I'd meet her at the corner. I was gone by the morning Where you going?
26601,Stefan," Corner of Bourbon and Dumaine, see how literal the sire bond is"
26602,Haley," They're gonna get us both k*ll, and we're just sitting here"
26603,Tyler, Kim is right. The point of breaking the sire bond is being free. They don't have to listen to me
26604,Haley," Yes, they do, Ty. You can make them. Hybrids are werewolves first. Wolves run in packs, and every pack needs an Alpha, or they end up challenging each other for dominance. Kim is challenging your position as Alpha. You need to put her in her place... now"
26605,Tyler," Long day tomorrow, Adrian. You want it to go better than today, you need to get some rest"
26606,Kim, Who do you think you are?
26607,Tyler," The guy telling you to call it a night. This could get a lot uglier right now, but I'm not gonna let it. Challenge me again, this conversation will end differently. You understand?"
26608,Kim, Whatever you say
26609,Tyler, Finish your drink and get Adrian back to the stables. We'll meet you there
26610,Adrian, Where we going?
26611,Kim, To pick a fight
26612,Damon, No way is she gonna be in the same spot after 70 years
26613,Stefan, So what are we gonna tell Elena?
26614,Damon, I was hoping we wouldn't have to tell her anything
26615,Stefan," Well, we can't just lie to her"
26616,Damon, It's not a lie. It's an omission for the greater good
26617,Stefan," Oh, I see. I see. That's Damon speak for, ""let's not do the right thing. Let's just do what's right for me."""
26618,Damon," Oh, what about you, o selfless one? Are you doing what's best for Elena or what's best for you? Because it looks to me like the only reason you want to break Elena's sire bond is to restore her original factory team Stefan settings. I'm gonna go get a drink. Hunt me down when you stop being a dick"
26619,Stefan, What the hell just happened?
26620,Damon, She kissed me
26621,Charlotte," Damon, I always knew you'd come back for me. I must have counted literally every brick on every building in all of New Orleans"
26622,Stefan, Literally every brick?
26623,Damon," Uh, Charlotte... Heh heh... Please tell me you had a full life and that you've done something other than counting bricks"
26624,Charlotte, Of course I have. I'm not crazy
26625,Stefan, Then why are you still here?
26626,Charlotte," You know when someone breaks up with you and there's a song that reminds you of them, first, you hate it, but then it brings back all the good memories of them. Counting the bricks is my song, and I've been playing it for decades"
26627,Stefan, That's a really long time stuck listening to the same song
26628,Damon," Yeah. Heh. Well, you know, in the plus column, you know New Orleans better than anyone in the world, which is really nice because we need your help finding someone"
26629,Bonnie, Check this out... Vamp speed video
26630,Elena," I look like superman. Watch this: This year's Christmas card. Being a vampire is so weird. Oh, my God, I love this bathtub. Why don't we come and hang out here more often?"
26631,Caroline, I'll tell you why. Cooties. Think of all the germ-ridden skanks that Damon has lured into his den of iniquity. Ok. I'm sorry. I've been good all night. I am stopping now
26632,Elena," No. Don't stop on my account. Rip away. It's only Damon, right?"
26633,Caroline," Well, say what you want about ripper Stefan, but at least he wasn't a man slut"
26634,Elena, So what exactly was it about him that made you jump right into bed with him as soon as you met him?
26635,Caroline, I didn't know what a sociopathic narcissist he was
26636,Elena, He's always been there for me when I needed him
26637,Caroline," Yeah, because he's hoping you'll sleep with him"
26638,Elena," Well, maybe I did"
26639,Caroline, You did what?
26640,Bonnie, You didn't
26641,Elena," Yeah. I did. Look. I know you two have issues with him, but I'm happy, and I wanted to spend tonight with my best friends so that I could tell them about it"
26642,Woman," Can I help you, gentlemen?"
26643,Damon, Hi. Looking for a witch. Sorry. No time for pleasantries
26644,Woman, I'm sorry. I don't understand
26645,Damon," Look... Nandi, is it? Let's skip the part where you pretend like you don't know what we're talking about. We need a spell that could break a vampire sire bond. Now, there was a witch here named val. Ring any bells?"
26646,Nandi, She was my great-grandmother
26647,Damon," She had a grimoire, and it had a spell"
26648,Val," The magic you're talking about is dark, powerful. Magic like this doesn't come cheap"
26649,Damon, How much?
26650,Val," Money won't cut it here, pretty one. Dark magic draws power from dark places. Casting the spell you need requires the sacrifice of 12 human souls"
26651,Stefan, A sacrifice? You brought me here knowing that the spell required a human sacrifice
26652,Damon," Well, I was hoping the recipe had changed"
26653,Nandi," Look. There's no magic like that here. I sell herbs and homeopathic remedies and dress it up with a little witchy-woo for the tourists, but I don't practice"
26654,Nandi," There's no one. All of her stuff is gone... The grimoires, her journals. We lost it all during Katrina. If a spell like that ever existed, it's gone for good"
26655,Bonnie," Elena, come here"
26656,Elena, Party is over. You guys need to leave
26657,Caroline," Don't be mad, ok? We're just looking out for you"
26658,Elena," Do you think it makes me happy that you guys hate him? I get it. His track record has been kind of spotty, but I don't hate him. I can't. He's... I think I'm falling in love with him"
26659,Caroline," Ugh, you're not falling in love with him, Elena. You're sired to him"
26660,Bonnie, What?
26661,Elena, What are you talking about?
26662,Caroline," I… Look. I'm sorry that it came out like that, but it's true. Damon's bl*od turned you. You couldn't feed from animals or bl*od bags because he told you so. Then he suggested that you try again with bl*od bags, and suddenly..."
26663,Elena, There's no way. I...
26664,Bonnie, Are you sure?
26665,Caroline, Yeah. Ask Stefan about it. He can explain it better than I can
26666,Elena, I'm sorry. You talked to Stefan about this?
26667,Caroline," It's not your fault, Elena, ok? Damon took advantage of you"
26668,Elena, Ok. You need to leave... Now
26669,Bonnie, Elena… 
26670,Caroline, come on
26671,Elena, I said leave
26672,Kim," Hello girls. Stop. One bite from a hybrid, and she's dead, remember?"
26673,Elena, Caroline
26674,Damon," Witch is lying. Doesn't practice magic, my ass"
26675,Stefan, Human sacrifice? Did you really think that I would go for this?
26676,Damon, Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures
26677,Stefan, Did you k*ll those 12 people in 1942?
26678,Damon," Absolutely, I did, and I'd do it again in a b*at if it meant a clean slate with Elena. Are you gonna help me good cop/bad cop this witch, or not?"
26679,Tyler," I get it, Hayley. I'll find them, and I'll get them in line"
26680,Elena, Bonnie says no luck with the locator spell
26681,Tyler, They've got to be here. They're not dumb enough to risk getting caught by Klaus in town
26682,Elena," Well, what do they want with Caroline?"
26683,Tyler," Kim is trying to prove she's the Alpha. If I can make her submit, the pack will fall in line, and we can finally get them free of Klaus. You'd think they'd play along with how much they hate him"
26684,Elena," But Adrian doesn't, does he? I mean, he's still sired to Klaus"
26685,Tyler," Being sired doesn't mean you feel differently about someone. I hated Klaus, but I still did everything he said. The bond affects how you act, not how you feel"
26686,Nandi, What are you doing here?
26687,Damon, Calling you out. You're not Val's great-granddaughter. You're her daughter. You're 80 years old. You don't look a day over 50. You're a practicing witch
26688,Nandi, Get out of my store
26689,Damon, Give me what I want
26690,Nandi, I gave you a chance to leave with your life
26691,Stefan," Wait, wait, wait, wait. We don't want any trouble, ok? We just need your help. That's all"
26692,Nandi," I told you, there's no one here who can help you. The kind of magic my mother practiced, it's unnatural. Witches don't even call it magic. We call it expression"
26693,Stefan, Is that like black magic?
26694,Nandi," Worse. Channeling the power of human sacrifices calls on darkness that can't exist on this plane without swallowing it whole. She sold you a bill of goods about breaking the sire bond because she wanted access to that power, and you gave it to her when you k*ll those 12 people"
26695,Damon, Are you saying there's no spell?
26696,Nandi," The bond can't be broken with magic. A vampire only bonds to her sire when she has feelings for him before she turns, human feelings. You want her free? You have to set her free. Tell her to live her life without you and never think of you again, to stop caring about you, and then leave her. That's the only way around the sire bond"
26697,Caroline, Why are you doing this?
26698,Kim, To show Tyler who's in charge
26699,Tyler," Stop it. Stop it, Kim. Caroline is with us, all right? We're all on the same team"
26700,Kim," She's on your team, not mine"
26701,Tyler, Stop it! Stop!
26702,Adrian," Ease up, Kim. Klaus won't like this"
26703,Kim," Huh, that's a very good point. Do you think he'll like this?"
26704,Tyler," Kim, don't do it. I swear to God..."
26705,Elena," No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If you really want to hit Klaus where it hurts, then torture me instead. He's fixated on keeping me alive. You want real revenge, or not?"
26706,Tyler," I'll rip her heart out right now. Kim put you all at risk today, and I'm not gonna hurt her. I'm not Klaus. I don't k*ll and torture my own friends to get what I want. Now, we broke the sire bond, but if you want to be free, we have to work together. No one can step out of line. Now, you're either with me or you're against me. Submit. Submit, or you die"
26707,Charlotte, So you're just leaving me again?
26708,Damon," No. I need to get on with my life, and so do you"
26709,Charlotte, I don't want to live without you
26710,Damon," If you want to make me happy, you will. You just forget about me. You'll never think of me again, and you'll find someone new, and you'll be happier than ever. Please just stop crying"
26711,Charlotte, I'm never gonna be able to forget about you
26712,Damon," Yes. You are, and I'm never gonna be happy until you realize that you're never gonna have the life that you deserve if I'm in it. Good-bye, Charlotte."
26713,Stefan, How'd it go?
26714,Damon, Set her free
26715,Stefan," Must've been hard, doing the right thing, especially when it's not something you want to do"
26716,Damon," Get to the point, Stefan. You don't think I'm gonna be able to do what I need to when I have to tell Elena to stay away from me"
26717,Stefan," Well, I mean, selflessness isn't exactly one of your most obvious character traits, Damon"
26718,Damon," Yeah? Well, one of these days, you're gonna realize you don't know me half as well as you think"
26719,Lexi," Damon... I know what you did, and you're not going overseas with Stefan. Do you understand me?"
26720,Damon," Well, Uncle Sam begs to differ"
26721,Lexi, You just k*ll 12 people
26722,Damon, How do you know they didn't have it coming?
26723,Lexi," Your brother has spent the last 20 years racked with guilt, fighting the temptation to drink human bl*od. He's serving in w*r as penance for the pain that he's caused. If he finds out what you did, he'll want to know how it is you function without guilt for the things that you do. He'll turn to you for guidance like he did before, and he'll become the ripper of Monterrey all over again"
26724,Damon, I've pretty much been on my own since our little falling out in 1912. Did you ever think that I just need my little brother?
26725,Lexi," And that's why you can't go. It might be good for you, Damon, but it will destroy Stefan. For once, you need to put someone else in front of yourself. You need to let him go"
26726,Damon, Good luck brother
26727,Stefan, I didn't know about that
26728,Damon," Yeah. Well, next time, I'll hang a billboard"
26729,Stefan," I know it may seem like I'm being unfair about this, like I'm upset about losing Elena to you, and I am, but after all this is over, if she never feels the same way about me as she used to, at least it'll be her choice"
26730,Damon," The dreaded c-word. I know what I have to do, Stefan"
26731,Caroline," I'm sorry. Hey, if you don't start hugging me back, this is gonna get really awkward really fast"
26732,Elena, You've got my hands pinned down
26733,Caroline, Oh
26734,Caroline, I'm a jerk. I promise to never again judge ever
26735,Elena, Just please don't tell Stefan about me and Damon. I promise that I'll tell him. I just need to figure out some stuff first
26736,Caroline, Off course
26737,Bonnie, You guys friends again? Thank God
26738,Caroline," Well, she saved my life, in spite of me being the nasty, bad witch"
26739,Elena," Thankfully, we had our good witch. You know, your hottie creepy Professor really knows his stuff, Bonnie"
26740,Bonnie," It's been baby steps, but he's helping with a whole new kind of magic. He calls it expression"
26741,Shane," You ever hear of a text message, maybe just give a guy a heads-up?"
26742,Haley," Adrian finished breaking the sire bond. You have your 12 hybrids. Now, where are my parents?"
26743,Shane, They're dead
26744,Haley, You lied to me?
26745,Shane," No. I didn't lie to you. I said I'd tell you where to find them. This is everything you ever wanted to know, including where they're buried"
26746,Haley," You just picked a fight with a werewolf. You know that, right?"
26747,Shane," Easy, k*ll, all right? I'm not declaring w*r here. Just because they're dead doesn't mean you can't see them again"
26748,Haley, What?
26749,Shane," Oh, this is far from over, Haley. We are the beginning"
26750,Caroline, You feel sorry for him?
26751,Stefan," Look. There's no other way to break a vampire's sire bond. As much as you and I both hate it, Damon does love Elena. Now he has to completely let her go. Can you imagine having to do that?"
26752,Caroline," I'm sorry I told her, ok? I kind of didn't have a choice. All I know is, he better do what he's supposed to do"
26753,Stefan, He'll do it. He's not as bad as he wants you to think. He'll do what he needs to do. He told me he would
26754,Caroline, Is that all he told you?
26755,Stefan, What do you mean?
26756,Caroline, Nothing. It's just... It's just... How can you trust him?
26757,Stefan," Because I think he loves her as much as I do. He can't be selfish with her, not anymore"
26758,Elena, Hey
26759,Damon, Hey back
26760,Elena, How was your night?
26761,Damon, Awful. Yours?
26762,Elena, Same
26763,Damon," Elena, we need to talk"
26764,Elena," I know that I'm sired to you, Damon. Caroline told me. That's what you and Stefan were doing, wasn't it? Is there a way to break it?"
26765,Damon, Not exactly... This is why we need to talk
26766,Elena," Tyler told me the bond doesn't affect how I feel, just the way I act. My feelings for you haven't changed, Damon. Nothing has changed"
26767,Damon, Everything has changed Elena
26768,Elena," Ok. Fine. Yeah. I mean, I've changed. So have you, Damon, and I'm happy, just like you were yesterday morning before we knew about any of this"
26769,Damon, You know what would make me happy? To know that this entire time that I've been completely in love with you that what you actually felt for me was real
26770,Elena," It is real. I know that it is, Damon. I know what you're about to do. Please don't do this to me"
26771,Damon," I don't want to do this, Elena. I'm not the good guy, remember? I'm the selfish one. I take what I want. I do what I want. I lie to my brother. I fall in love with his girl. I don't do the right thing... But I have to do the right thing by you"
26772,Elena, Does this feels wrong?
26773,Elena, Does this feels wrong?
26774,Damon, This would be so much more fun if we were naked
26775,Elena," That was your call, not mine"
26776,Damon, I was being a gentleman. You shouldn't have stayed
26777,Elena, I know
26778,Damon," I should have made you leave, sent you packing. I promised Stefan"
26779,Elena, I know
26780,Damon," You're sired to me, Elena, which means everything that you think you feel might not even be real"
26781,Elena," I know, Damon, but... It feels real. And I'm not ready to let go of that"
26782,Damon, I could make you. Invoke the sire bond
26783,Elena, So do it
26784,Damon, I told him I would set you free. Right after I didn't tell him that we slept together
26785,Elena," So, what do you want to do?"
26786,Damon, I want to throw you back in my bed and never let you leave
26787,Elena, So do it
26788,Damon, Saved by the cell phone
26789,Elena, I have to meet Bonnie. She's teaching Jeremy how not to k*ll me. Want to come?
26790,Stefan, Looks like a giant snowflake
26791,Klaus, I prefer to think of it as an expression of post-modernism. It's my donation to the winter wonderland charity event
26792,Adrian, You said it was urgent?
26793,Klaus, Yes. Take this to the mystic grill immediately
26794,Adrian, You want me to be a delivery guy?
26795,Klaus," What I want is for you to do whatever I say, without the attitude. Be careful with that. It's still wet"
26796,Stefan," Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, you know"
26797,Klaus, What is the point of my hybrids being sired to me if I can't maximize on the benefits of free labor? What are you doing here?
26798,Stefan, Elena is sired to Damon
26799,Klaus, I intuited as much
26800,Stefan," Which means I need to find the cure now more than ever, and here you are making post-modern snowflakes"
26801,Klaus," I've delivered. I retrieved the hunter's sword from Italy, which we'll use to decipher the map hidden in the hunter's mark. You're the one who's supposed to deliver the hunter and his mark"
26802,Stefan," Well, Jeremy is the hunter, and he has to keep k*ll vampires to complete his mark, but we can't quite figure out how to keep him from k*ll us"
26803,Klaus," Sounds like quite the chore, which is why I feel perfectly justified in doing a little charity work"
26804,Stefan, Or maybe you're lying about having found the sword
26805,Klaus," Why would I lie to you, Stefan? We're in this together. The hilt acts as a cypher which we'll use to decode the marks on Jeremy's tattoo when he's k*ll enough vampires to complete it. I heard you moved out of your house. Bit of a martyr move, hmm?"
26806,Stefan," I'm not here to bond, Klaus"
26807,Klaus," Oh, on the contrary, I think right now I'm the best friend you've got"
26808,Adrian," I'm sick of taking his crap. I should rip his throat off, see if he can boss us around without a larynx"
26809,Tyler, You won't have to take it much longer
26810,Kim," You keep saying that, but here we are, hiding, plotting a revolution that's never gonna happen"
26811,Haley, Never say never. And never say I don't pull through. I found the witch that's gonna save your lives
26812,Adrian, Are you serious?
26813,Tyler, We promised you guys we'd free you from Klaus. You did your part by breaking your sire bond. Now Hayley and I are going to do ours
26814,Caroline, You're going to do what?
26815,Tyler," Hayley found a witch strong enough to do the body-jump spell... You know, the Klaus specialty"
26816,Caroline," So you're going to put him in someone else's body, and then what?"
26817,Tyler," We'll encase the body in concrete, then bury it"
26818,Caroline, Why not just desiccate him like Bonnie did?
26819,Tyler, Because to do that spell you have to stop a human heart. I was a little short of volunteers
26820,Caroline," Well, who was dumb enough to volunteer their body to be a Klaus sublet?"
26821,Tyler," Ok, don't freak out"
26822,Caroline, Freak out? Freak out?! I'm about to hemorrhage. You volunteered?
26823,Tyler," It's not forever, just long enough for the hybrids to be able to completely disappear"
26824,Caroline," I can think of better ways for us to spend our senior year than you buried in concrete, Tyler"
26825,Tyler, This started with me. This has to end with me. I need your support
26826,Bonnie, Jeremy?
26827,Jeremy, They shouldn't be here
26828,Bonnie, They're here to help you. Do you trust me?
26829,Jeremy," Yeah. Yeah, I trust you"
26830,Bonnie, Let's go inside
26831,Damon, What the hell is Professor Shadypants doing here?
26832,Elena, I invited him
26833,Shane," Hey, listen. We are ready to get started, but before we can do that, we need her... In here"
26834,Elena," This is your house now, Jer. You have to invite me in"
26835,Shane," Go ahead, Jeremy. Invite her in"
26836,Jeremy, You can come in
26837,Stefan, Hey. Sorry. I know I'm late
26838,Caroline," If I'm gonna be a friend in your time of need, then you need to work on your punctuality. I'm in a crisis. Where are you?"
26839,Stefan, I'm at my house. Why? What's wrong?
26840,Caroline, My boyfriend is a dumb-ass martyr. And why are you at your house? Aren't you trying to keep your distance from Elena?
26841,Stefan," Well, she's not here anymore. Damon took Jeremy to the Gilbert lake house with Bonnie, so I guess her house is safe for her again. Hey, listen; I got Klaus to tell me a little bit more about this hunter's sword. You know that map in Jeremy's tattoo? The sword decodes it. It's literally the key to finding the cure"
26842,Caroline, Klaus told you this?
26843,Stefan, Yeah. Why?
26844,Caroline, And did he happen to hand over the sword for safekeeping?
26845,Stefan," Uh, what do you think? What's wrong?"
26846,Caroline," We need to get our hands on that sword, like, today. Tyler and his hybrids are taking out Klaus tonight"
26847,Caroline, Here to steal tiny Tim's crutches?
26848,Klaus, Dickens was a dark man. You would have liked him
26849,Caroline," Nice snowflake, by the way"
26850,Klaus, Is my work really that literal?
26851,Caroline, I'm serious. There's something... Lonely about it
26852,Klaus, I'm gonna take that as a compliment. Can I offer you some champagne?
26853,Caroline, Can't. Too many adult prying eyes. Don't want to be a high-school cautionary tale at the next town meeting
26854,Klaus," Well, then, it's a good thing the high-school part is nearly over"
26855,Caroline," If we're gonna be nice to each other, then I will need that glass of champagne"
26856,Klaus, Is that our thing?
26857,Caroline," We don't have a ""thing."""
26858,Damon," Well, he's not walking around with it. Check the rest of the house"
26859,Stefan, I am. I haven't found anything
26860,Damon, Try the sock drawer. People leave the sketchiest stuff in sock drawers
26861,Stefan," I'm gonna need real ideas, Damon"
26862,Damon," Here's two: k*ll Tyler before he goes to Klaus, or, since Klaus has suddenly become MVP in our relay race for the cure, tell him about the hybrids"
26863,Stefan, Nobody's k*ll Tyler
26864,Damon, Hello? Stefan
26865,Stefan," Look, I know it's a touchy subject, but do you know where Elena is today?"
26866,Damon, I think she's running around... Trying to figure out how to deprogram Jeremy
26867,Stefan, How'd she take it last night... You telling her to stay away from you?
26868,Damon, Not well
26869,Stefan, You okay?
26870,Damon," Peachy. Got to go. Bonnie's enlisted Dr. Evil in her plan, and I have to thwart him"
26871,Shane," All Jeremy feels when he sees a vampire is a burning desire to k*ll them. Even if consciously he doesn't want to, as in your case, it's his subconscious that's calling the shots"
26872,Bonnie, Persuasion helps reverse your conscious thoughts
26873,Shane," Think of it as kind of a conditioned response, right? See vampire, k*ll vampire. What I'm doing is creating a kind of middle step. It's like a detour where his subconscious learns to recognize you as someone he loves, someone he wants to protect. And that gives him a choice. He can choose to take the detour instead of the conditioned response. Ok. Talk to him. He'll listen"
26874,Elena, I'm not... Sure what to say
26875,Shane," You chose to do this here at your family's vacation house, right? So maybe just start by telling him why"
26876,Elena," Every holiday, we came here. This place was family, and when mom and dad died, Jenna made us come here, and we thought it was an awful idea, but it was like they were here with us. They would have wanted us to stick together, Jer... To fight for each other no matter what"
26877,Shane," Jeremy, how do you feel about Elena right now?"
26878,Jeremy," She ruined our lives. She's not even my real sister. She's just the reason that everyone I've ever loved has died. She means nothing to me. I will k*ll her, even if that means I die myself"
26879,Jeremy, Did it work?
26880,Caroline, Hey
26881,Stefan, Hey
26882,Caroline, Did you find the sword?
26883,Stefan, Nope
26884,Caroline, What are we gonna do now?
26885,Stefan, Klaus is the only sh*t we have at finding the cure. We need him. Tyler has to call it off
26886,Tyler," Well, that's not gonna happen"
26887,Tyler," You told him? I've had 12 hybrids sworn to secrecy for a month. I have Hayley and a witch risking their lives, and you're blabbing my plan to him?"
26888,Stefan," Look, all I'm asking you for is a little bit of time, ok?"
26889,Tyler," How long? An hour? A day? Because every minute that goes by that we don't do this, they're at risk. You and Klaus already served one of them up for Jeremy to k*ll. I don't owe you anything. I'm taking him out"
26890,Stefan," I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that"
26891,Caroline, Stefan…
26892,Stefan," I'm sorry, but I can't"
26893,Tyler," Sorry, man, but you don't have a choice"
26894,Damon," You're not allowed to feel this sorry for yourself unless you're sitting on a bar stool. Fortunately, I travel with the bar"
26895,Elena," It didn't work. I shouldn't have put so much hope into reprogramming someone's mind. If it were that easy, then you and I wouldn't be in this situation. Right? Last time I was here, I was so completely in love with Stefan. Now that's barely a memory. Is that the sire bond... Or just that I'm so happy to be here with you?"
26896,Damon, Maybe there's something else they can try
26897,Caroline, Tyler
26898,Tyler, Keep them down here until we're ready to bring Klaus in. Use these if you have to
26899,Stefan," Come on, Tyler. This is bigger than you. It's about more than revenge for us "
26900,Tyler," I know what it's about for you, Stefan. It's about the cure. You know what happens to a hybrid when he's cured of being a vampire? We go back to being werewolves, turning on every full moon. We could give a rat's ass about the cure"
26901,Caroline," Tyler, come on"
26902,Tyler," I needed you on my side, care. That's all I wanted"
26903,Bonnie, Are you okay? Shane wants to try again
26904,Damon," Survey says: Ehhh. Professor Shane has been dipping into the magical herbs a little too much if he thinks using a vampire to suppress the need to k*ll another one is going to work on a hunter. It's like dangling a cheeseburger in front of someone on a master cleanse. Just find someone else to attach your warm and fuzzy detour feelings to. Gee, I wonder who that could be"
26905,Jeremy, You. I feel that way about you
26906,Damon," Well, this isn't awkward at all. I'll be... anywhere else"
26907,Shane," It was good thinking using Bonnie as Jeremy's emotional touchstone. Damon is very intuitive. And Bonnie told me about your relationship with him. I don't mean to pry, obviously"
26908,Elena, It's... complicated. Any ideas how to hypnotize me out of it?
26909,Shane," You know, in all my world travels, the one spell that I've never found is how to break somebody from loving too much. Trust me, I've looked. My wife and son died. I was just... I was trying to figure out a way not to miss them"
26910,Damon," If your hypno-herbs work, we should be singing ""Kumbaya"" around the fire by dinner. So now tell me why I'm not k*ll you"
26911,Elena, Damon…
26912,Damon, I'm serious. Why are you after the vampire cure?
26913,Shane," I didn't say I was looking for the cure, but I can tell you where to find it"
26914,Damon, Klaus' sword will tell us where to find it
26915,Shane," The sword will lead you there, sure, but so can I"
26916,Elena, What? How
26917,Shane, Because I've already been there
26918,Carol, Instruct the guests to drop their donations at the gift tree in the grill
26919,April," Yes, ma'am"
26920,Carol, Excuse me
26921,Carol," There you are. Quick, a toast before people can judge us. What's wrong?"
26922,Tyler, Please say something
26923,Carol, But you'll miss graduation. Which... I guess is a ridiculous thing to worry about
26924,Tyler, I'm their Alpha. They're looking to me to help them
26925,Carol," You do what you have to do, Tyler. Don't look so shocked. I'm trying to channel your father. He'd be proud of you, you know. You're a leader of people, just like he was"
26926,Tyler," Thank you, mom"
26927,Damon, It's a rock
26928,Shane, It's not just any rock
26929,Damon, Hmm. So is this that silly little wives' tale that you told at the occult exhibit?
26930,Shane," All right, long story short... Once upon a time, there was a witch named Silas who loved a girl and wanted to be with her forever. So he and his best friend, another witch, made an immortality spell, and then Silas' best friend witch got jealous and k*ll Silas' girl before he had a chance to make her immortal. Well, cursed to an eternity without his one true love, Silas finds a way to reverse the immortality spell, and then, before he has a chance to take it, his former friend buries him underground, leaving him and the cure to rot"
26931,Elena, So it's a cure for immortality?
26932,Shane," Human bl*od is the life force of an immortal. No more immortality, no more need to feed on bl*od. You dig up Silas, and you've got your cure"
26933,Caroline," Oh, this is ridiculous. We are not hostages"
26934,Kim," Sure you are, sweetie"
26935,Stefan, Relax. It's my brother
26936,Stefan, What's up?
26937,Damon," Don't ask how or why or who, but I just found the answer to your Tyler problem"
26938,Stefan, You're kidding. We don't need the sword
26939,Shane," This is the mark of the brotherhood of the five. Then up the arm, you have the m*rder of a girl by a witch. The symbols in the vines are your map, which you obviously no longer need. When this mark is complete, it will contain the spell that we need to dig up Silas"
26940,Damon," And where did you say he was buried? Oh, I forgot. You didn't"
26941,Shane," You've threatened to k*ll me, what, like, 3 times already this week? The location is how I'm gonna survive your bad moods"
26942,Elena," And what's in it for you? If not the cure, then what?"
26943,Shane," I'm in this for Silas, all right? Up until this point, he's only been myth"
26944,Damon, So write a thesis
26945,Shane, Would you rather be the guy who writes about Noah's ark or the one who sails it down the Hudson River?
26946,Damon, I'm not buying it
26947,Shane," You don't have to buy anything. You just have to believe that I can fix your brother, and when his hunter's mark is complete, I'm gonna take you to the cure"
26948,Tyler, How the hell did you even get out?
26949,Caroline, I got out because even your idiot hybrids recognized the stupidity of your Alpha hybrid martyr plan
26950,Tyler," I'm not going to fight with you anymore, Caroline"
26951,Caroline," Oh, we're gonna do plenty of fighting, the second that you shove Klaus into someone else's body"
26952,Tyler, We've been through this. I don't have anyone else's body
26953,Caroline," Yeah? Well, I do"
26954,Haley, What? Who?
26955,Caroline, Klaus' sister Rebekah. She's got a dagger in her. Stefan's been hiding her coffin in the tunnels. We dump Klaus into her body and bury her. We just k*ll two original birds with one stone
26956,Haley, It's too late to change the plan
26957,Tyler, Call Bonnie. Make sure it'll work
26958,Haley, Tyler
26959,Tyler," It's a brilliant plan, Hayley"
26960,Tyler, You're a genius. I love you
26961,Caroline," Mmm. I love you, even when I hate you"
26962,Tyler," I got to go find my mom, let her know I might actually graduate"
26963,Shane, How's it going?
26964,Bonnie, I think we're making progress
26965,Bonnie," Caroline, hey"
26966,Caroline," Bonnie, I need you to think fast. I know that the daggers don't work on Klaus, but what if we put his essence into Rebekah? It'll work, right? Say it'll work"
26967,Bonnie, Slow down. Slow down. What's happening?
26968,Caroline," Just come on, Bonnie. Will it work?"
26969,Bonnie, Yeah. I don't see why not
26970,Caroline," Oh. Bonnie Bennett, I love you"
26971,Bonnie, Do you need my help? I can leave Elena here with Jeremy
26972,Caroline," Elena? She's there, too?"
26973,Bonnie, Yeah. She came with Damon. Who's being slightly less horrible than usual
26974,Caroline, You know what? I can't deal with this right now
26975,Caroline, She said it would work
26976,Haley, I gathered. Congratulations
26977,Caroline, Than you
26978,Haley, My pleasure
26979,Elena, Jer and I should take these decorations home with us. We could use the holiday cheer
26980,Damon, Look at you... suddenly Polly optimist
26981,Elena, I think Shane's gonna get us through this. I trust him. Which you clearly don't
26982,Damon, Maybe because I think he blew up 12 people at the Young farm
26983,Elena, What?!
26984,Damon," A little tip, Professor: I heard you before you even took your first step"
26985,Shane, I see we're back to the false accusation part of our relationship
26986,Elena, What is he talking about?
26987,Shane," Da... ha. Damon discovered that I was in contact with pastor Young prior to the expl*si*n at the Young farm. The pastor was severely depressed. He had lost his wife to cancer, and he sought me out for a little supernatural assistance. I tried to help, but he was too far gone. It's just I never expected that he'd take 11 innocents with him"
26988,Jeremy, Elena
26989,Jeremy, It's okay. I think we've got this
26990,Bonnie," Elena, don't move, ok? No matter what"
26991,Shane," Jeremy, remember the detour. Choose the right path"
26992,Klaus, She doesn't like me much. Where have you been all day?
26993,Stefan, I've been around
26994,Klaus," I'm not interested in vagaries, Stefan. You've been dodgy and Caroline's been lovely, which I've come to recognize as a tool of distraction. Now do you have something to share with me, or should I compel it out of you?"
26995,Stefan, I broke into your safe to look for the sword
26996,Klaus, Why?
26997,Stefan, Because I don't trust you
26998,Klaus, I showed you the sword. I explained its value. I've been on your side the entire time. What do you want from me...A secret brotherhood handshake?
26999,Stefan, I found the letters. You have a few pen pals over the centuries?
27000,Klaus," Well, is keeping my v*ctim' letters really so different from writing their names on a wall, like you did, ripper? Loneliness, Stefan. That's why you and I memorialize our dead. There's the briefest of moments before we k*ll where we literally hold their life in our hands, and then we rip it away, and we're left with nothing. So gathering other people's letters or writing their names on a wall... It's a reminder... That in the end we're left infinitely and utterly alone"
27001,April," Oh. Sorry. Oh. Hello? Are you ok? Um... Oh, my gosh! Caroline! Oh! Somebody help! Help!"
27002,April, Holy crap
27003,Caroline, Have you seen Hayley?
27004,April, You didn't have a pulse. You were dead
27005,Caroline," Stefan, it's me. That little werewolf slut has lost her mind. Go to the Lockwood cellar and make sure that Rebekah's body is still there. I'm gonna find Tyler. Hayley is trying to screw this up"
27006,Caroline," Forget everything you just saw and heard. You are miss Mystic Falls, and you have duties to fulfill"
27007,April, Okay
27008,Matt, There you are. Stefan has been looking for you. Adrian's leading Klaus to the cellar
27009,Caroline, How come the only time April Young isn't following you around like a lost puppy is when I'm lying dead with a broken neck?
27010,Matt, April saw you?
27011,Caroline, Yeah. It's ok. I compelled her
27012,Matt, She's... she's wearing Jeremy's vervain bracelet. She can't be compelled
27013,Tyler," Hey, mom. I don't see you. Things have changed. It's gonna be fine. I'll be back later. I'll pick you up"
27014,Tyler, What are you doing here? You're supposed to be taking the witch to the cellar
27015,Haley," There is no witch, Tyler"
27016,Tyler, What?
27017,Haley, I made it up
27018,Kim, Where the hell is the witch? Adrian should be here any minute
27019,Adrian, Kim
27020,Kim, No!
27021,Haley, I never intended for you to put Klaus down. I needed him for the sacrifice
27022,Tyler, What?
27023,Haley," I don't know how to explain it, but I made a deal with someone who can help me find my family"
27024,Tyler, What are you talking about? What kind of deal?
27025,Haley," There needed to be 12 for the sacrifice, Tyler"
27026,Tyler, 12 what?
27027,Haley, I'm sorry
27028,Tyler," Hayley, what did you do?"
27029,Haley," If you run now, you might make it out alive"
27030,Klaus," Where is Tyler Lockwood? You'd do well to answer me, love. Where is he?!"
27031,Kim, I don't know
27032,Klaus, Wrong answer
27033,Jeremy, Check this out
27034,Elena, Jenna used that to make out with Logan fell
27035,Elena," All the drama, and you're missing the actual fun part"
27036,Damon," Elena, we can't. I can't"
27037,Elena," Damon, you can't keep telling me that this isn't real. I know how I feel and that you feel it, too, so stop fighting it"
27038,Damon," It's good to see you like that... All normal with your brother. I want that again for you. Christmas was always mine and Stefan's favorite holiday when we were kids, not that I've celebrated since. I kind of miss that"
27039,Elena, You're thinking about how upset he'll be when he finds out that you and I are together
27040,Damon, I've been lying to him all day
27041,Elena, No. You were helping me with Jeremy
27042,Damon," The point is not what I was doing. The point is that I'm here with you. I was supposed to invoke the sire bond, Elena, send you away I was supposed to do the right thing by you and the right thing by my brother. Which is what I'm gonna do right now. You're gonna go home"
27043,Elena, What? No. Damon...
27044,Damon," I'm gonna stay here with Jeremy. I'm gonna help him complete the mark. I'll teach him how to hunt. I'll protect him, and we'll k*ll vampires without you"
27045,Elena," Damon, please"
27046,Damon," I'm setting you free, Elena. This is what I want. This is what will make me happy"
27047,Caroline, Matt can't find April. I can't reach Tyler. This is a disaster. Is this you in crisis mode? Because it's a lot more stealth than mine
27048,Stefan," I thought I'd be happier watching Klaus get led away to the slaughter, but for some reason, I can't help but feel kind of... Guilty"
27049,Caroline, Yeah. You and me both. All day I've been trying to remind myself of all the horrible things he's done
27050,Stefan," See, that's the thing. We've all done horrible things. And I'm sitting here trying to figure out what makes us any better than him. And I think it's just that we have family we can trust"
27051,Caroline," Yeah, you're right Stefan. Trust is everything. Have you heard from Damon?"
27052,Stefan, Yeah. He's still with Jeremy at the lake house
27053,Caroline, Did he happen to mention... Where Elena was?
27054,Stefan," Wait. Why are you... why are you asking me this? They're together, aren't they? How together are they? Caroline, tell me. How together are they?"
27055,Jeremy, Thank you
27056,Elena," I was ready to fight you on this, but suddenly every part of my body is telling me that I need to get in this car and leave you"
27057,Damon, So do it
27058,Carol," Tyler, honey, you're supposed to be in my sober cab. I think I drank half the party"
27059,Klaus," Good evening, Carol. You're looking for Tyler… I'd like a little word with him myself"
27060,Carol," Klaus, please. Don't hurt him. He's my son. He's all I have"
27061,Klaus," And you're all he has. There's a beautiful symmetry to that, don't you think?"
27062,Sheriff Forbes," Carol Lockwood always said that togetherness, in times of tragedy, leads to healing. That one community is stronger than a thousand of its members. But how does a community stay strong after losing its leader? And Carol was so much more than just a mayor. She was... An open-minded friend... And a concerned mother, taken from us too soon by a terrible accident"
27063,Tyler, Screw this
27064,Sheriff Forbes, Please join me in observing a minute of silence in her memory
27065,Bonnie, Are you okay?
27066,Elena, I'll be right back
27067,Sheriff Forbes," Thank you very much. In the wake of this tragedy, the town has selected an interim mayor. Many of you already know him. Please welcome Mr. Rudy Hopkins"
27068,Rudy," Thank you, sheriff. Carol Lockwood put this town first, and that's why I'm here to talk to you guys. You folks..."
27069,Elena, April? What's wrong?
27070,April, Nothing. I'm fine
27071,Elena, But you're crying
27072,April," It's just the whole mayor thing. You know, it's bringing up stuff with my dad. And I know you're a vampire"
27073,Elena, Wait. What?
27074,April, Was that necessary?
27075,Rebekah," No, but it was fun"
27076,Caroline," Hey, you just missed the mandatory all-school assembly"
27077,Stefan," Well, that's because I'm at a mandatory all-alone drinking party"
27078,Caroline, Seriously? You decided to go on a ripper bender now?
27079,Stefan, My brother slept with Elena. Kind of puts a little bit of a damper on things
27080,Caroline," First of all, you are not supposed to know that. Second of all, Tyler is already spiraling, and he gets priority"
27081,Stefan, His mother just died. What do you expect?
27082,Caroline," I'm his girlfriend. I expect him to talk to me. But instead he's all angry, and it doesn't help that everyone keeps referring to his mother's death as an accident, which is really just a polite way of saying that she was drunk"
27083,Stefan, You think Klaus k*ll her?
27084,Caroline," Well, I don't think she drowned in a Martini glass. Just get it together. I can't do it alone"
27085,April, The assembly's over
27086,Elena, What the hell's going on?
27087,April, The school will be empty soon. How many times did you compel me? Don't... Just don't lie. Rebekah says you lie
27088,Elena," Rebekah's not who you think she is, April"
27089,April," What, she's not a thousand-year-old original vampire?"
27090,Elena," Listen, we can figure this out, ok, but we have to get out of here"
27091,Rebekah, Sorry. Not allowed. Why don't you take a seat? The rest of the class will be here shortly
27092,Elena," Hey, it's me. Look, I know why you sent me away. You think that what I'm feeling for you is because of the sire bond, but I hate not being near you "
27093,Jeremy, Go ahead. Make a move
27094,Matt," I drove up here to be your wingman, not kick your ass"
27095,Matt, Ah! Ok. I get it. I get it. You're a badass
27096,Jeremy, Did you see that?
27097,Damon, Couldn't miss it. It was in slow motion
27098,Jeremy," Then teach me something useful. We've been here for days, and so far all you've done is bark orders"
27099,Damon," Okay. Take a seat at the bench, quarterback. Karate kid wants a sh*t at the tiger"
27100,Matt," Jeremy, you're not ready for this"
27101,Damon," Now, all I have to do is apply a little pressure under your jaw"
27102,Damon, Really? Again?
27103,Girl, Double pepperoni 3 days in a row. You guys eat anything else?
27104,Damon, Why? Are you offering?
27105,Damon," A little something extra cut off the pizza pipeline for a couple days. No matter how much they beg, don't come back"
27106,Girl," Sorry, guys"
27107,Jeremy, You're gonna starve us now?
27108,Damon," If that's what it takes to make you a hunter. Now run around the lake, twice"
27109,Damon, Keep him company
27110,Matt, I don't have to listen to you
27111,Damon, You do if you want to eat
27112,Elena," Being near you, and I miss you, Damon. I wish you would just let me come to you"
27113,Stefan, What?
27114,Rebekah," Guess who? I'm back, dagger-free, and I'm holding Elena hostage at the High School. Just thought you should know"
27115,Stefan, Who the hell was dumb enough to pull that dagger out of you? 
27116,Rebekah, I'll be asking the questions today. See you soon
27117,Caroline, I'm only ready to talk to you if you're ready to rejoin civilization
27118,Stefan, How would you like to drive the white oak stake through Rebekah's heart?
27119,Caroline," If it means you're not drinking your way through the mystic grill, sure"
27120,Sheriff Forbes, So… First speech under your belt. Now for the fun part. Welcome to the world of careful cover-ups. We've ruled Carol's death as head trauma from a fall. That's the official autopsy
27121,Rudy," She did not go gently, did she? Any leads?"
27122,Sheriff Forbes, We have ideas
27123,Rudy, Let me guess. Sharp teeth and bad table manners?
27124,Sheriff Forbes," You sure you want this? I mean, 6 people were offered this job before you. They all said no for a reason"
27125,Rudy," I'm saying yes for a reason, and my reason just walked in"
27126,Sheriff Forbes, I'll let you know what we find
27127,Rudy, Thank you Sheriff
27128,Bonnie," Hey, sheriff. Hey, dad"
27129,Bonnie, So… Far cry from being a traveling pharmaceutical rep
27130,Rudy," I noticed a few of your friends missing from the assembly. So much for mandatory I guess, huh?"
27131,Bonnie," Dad, stop it. You can't come in here and start making rules"
27132,Rudy, I think this town could use a few more rules
27133,Bonnie, You're forgetting I can help protect the town
27134,Rudy," I am well aware of your gifts, Bonnie... But don't forget I'm your father. That means that I get to protect you"
27135,Rebekah," Hello, Stefan"
27136,Stefan, I'm here. What do you want?
27137,Rebekah, The same thing I wanted when you helped make Klaus stab me
27138,Stefan, The cure
27139,Rebekah, I hope you're not waiting for Caroline to show up and stake me...
27140,Rebekah, Because I already found her
27141,Elena, Stefan
27142,Rebekah," Did I say you could move? Class is in session. You've all been compelled. You know the rules. Answer my questions honestly, no disobedience, no one leaves. April, my sweet, take notes. This is how you get answers in this town. Let's start with a little quiz. In the year 1114, my brother learned... thanks to yours truly... About a brotherhood of vampire hunters with tattoos that grew with each k*ll. And these tattoos reveal what? Elena?"
27143,Elena, A map
27144,Rebekah," Which led to, Caroline?"
27145,Caroline, A cure for vampirism
27146,Rebekah," Perfect. We're all caught up. Stefan Salvatore, the last time we saw each other, you had a vampire hunter, but in order to decode the map, you needed the location of the hunter's sword, which you got out of me using some very dirty tricks assuming you found the sword, you must have found the cure, and yet you're all still vampires, which means something went wrong"
27147,Rebekah, What are you doing?
27148,April, You asked me to take notes
27149,Rebekah," I wasn't being literal, darling. But now that you mention it, a flow chart would be nice, which means index cards and push pins. Go fetch"
27150,Stefan, You're wasting your time. We don't know anything
27151,Rebekah," So you just gave up? I thought you'd do anything to save Elena, even if it meant taking the cure yourself so you could grow old and die with her"
27152,Rebekah, Why do you look so surprised? I'm missing something. What is it?
27153,Caroline," They broke up, okay? Now let us go"
27154,Rebekah," Wait. I'm confused. I thought Elena was your epic love, Stefan. I asked you what happened, and you have to tell me"
27155,Stefan, She slept with Damon
27156,Damon, Good… Now do it like your life depends on it 'cause it does
27157,Jeremy, Don't act like you care about my life. You care about the hunter's mark and curing Elena so she's not sired to your ass
27158,Damon," Both require you to be alive, which is why I've updated our relationship status to ""it's complicated."" You talked to her at all? Elena?"
27159,Jeremy, Maybe. Why? Running out of voicemails to listen to?
27160,Klaus, I'm sorry. Did I interrupt play time?
27161,Jeremy, What the hell are you doing here?
27162,Klaus," I'm simply appreciating the sights and smells of nature, neither of which presently include rotting vampire flesh, so I'm a bit concerned. How many vampires has he k*ll?"
27163,Damon," If we throw Jeremy out into the world right now, he's chum "
27164,Klaus," Now, see, that's not a number. 12... that's a number. That's how many of my hybrids I slaughtered with my sword. 3... that's how many days it took to quell the urge to k*ll your brother, after he knowingly watched as I walked into a death trap. One… That's the number of purposes you serve. You are here to grow Jeremy's mark, so I ask again... How many vampires has he k*ll since he's been here?"
27165,Damon, Zero
27166,Klaus," Hmm. That's a pity. I'm going to need that cure sooner rather than later, hybrid shortage and all. How can I help?"
27167,Damon," You know... Now that you mention it, Jeremy... Watch and learn"
27168,Damon, That's for Carol Lockwood
27169,Rebekah," So, vampire Elena is a trollop who likes bad boys, which explains why Stefan reeks of alcohol. But what it doesn't explain is why sweet, loving, innocent Elena could be so heartless towards Stefan. How could she hurt you like that? Answer, please"
27170,Stefan," She didn't know it at the time, but she was sired to Damon"
27171,Rebekah," A sire bond. Fascinating. And what do you think about that, Elena?"
27172,Elena, I think you're sad and bored and in desperate need of a hobby
27173,Rebekah, You're hiding something. 'Fess up
27174,Elena, I didn't sleep with Damon because of the sire bond. I slept with Damon because I'm in love with him
27175,Caroline, What does any of this have to do with the stupid cure?
27176,Rebekah," You're right. We got off the point. Stefan, how do I find the cure? Unless you'd rather talk about Damon and Elena all day"
27177,Stefan, There's a Professor. He knows where the cure is
27178,Rebekah," Thank you. And, uh, where do I find this Professor?"
27179,Bonnie," Oh, and so now I'm ""gifted""? He hates my witch heritage. That's why he travels all the time. He can't handle it and suddenly he wants to be a protective father? No, not like this. Come on. Distract me. Isn't there some... Magic therapy thing you haven't shown me yet?"
27180,Shane," Listen, Bonnie, I hate to tell you this... Actually, you know what? I take that back. I'm proud to tell you this. You don't need my help anymore. In fact... I was hoping to present this with a cupcake or something"
27181,Shane, Happy graduation
27182,Bonnie, It's beautiful
27183,Shane," It's human bone. Legend says it was worn by the 2,000-year-old witch Qetsiyah, who drew on it... For strength. Bonnie, you have come so far so fast. If you trust my opinion, your magic is exactly where it needs to be"
27184,Bonnie, Does this mean I have to go home now?
27185,Shane, It means I got a stack of papers I got to grade by tomorrow
27186,Bonnie, I can take a hint. Thanks Shane
27187,Bonnie, Oh my god. Kol!
27188,Bonnie, Shane?
27189,Tyler, I told you I don't want to talk
27190,Rebekah, I heard. You're keeping all that rage bottled up inside. Caroline's worried sick about you
27191,Tyler, Rebekah?
27192,Rebekah," Hello Tyler. I heard my brother made a real mess of your life. Believe me, I can relate. You have my condolences. In fact, why don't you come down to the high school so you can accept them in person?"
27193,Tyler, And why would I do that?
27194,Rebekah, Because I have your girlfriend. Maybe you have a better sh*t at saving her than you did your mother
27195,Kol, Sister…
27196,Kol, You're even worse than Klaus
27197,Rebekah, Kol. Finally. Did you bring me what I asked for?
27198,Rebekah, You must be Shane
27199,Damon," If you're here for payback, go for it. But you'll be stuck baby-sitting the little hunter that could"
27200,Klaus," You know... If you adjust your angle a little bit, you'll find a sharper edge"
27201,Damon, I know how to whittle. Thanks. Now I know why those hybrids hated you. You are annoying
27202,Klaus," Actually, I'm just perplexed as to why Jeremy hasn't k*ll any vampires"
27203,Damon," Darwinism, Klaus. He needs to be able to protect himself before we hunt down his first vampire nest"
27204,Klaus," And here was I, thinking you were the fun brother. Well, let's play a little game, shall we? Jeremy needs more v*ctim, and there's a whole town of people down the road just waiting to be turned into vampires for the slaughter"
27205,Damon," You don't think that occurred to me, Klaus?"
27206,Klaus," The tragedy is, Damon, it did occur to you, yet you chose to ignore it. And my guess is you did it to impress Elena. Somehow, to honor her, you'll find a way to spare innocent lives and walk Jeremy down the moral high road. That's why I've already made the necessary corrections"
27207,Damon, What did you do?
27208,Matt, Don't tell me he ordered another pizza
27209,Girl," No, I'm just an idiot. I ran out of gas and my phone's dead. Think I could use yours?"
27210,Matt," Yeah, come on in. I'll run upstairs and grab my cell"
27211,Jeremy, What are you doing here?
27212,Matt, Car drama. Your friend just went to go get his phone
27213,Jeremy," Well, I'm about to go take a shower, but you're more than welcome to wait inside"
27214,Girl, Thanks
27215,Shane," Kol… And Rebekah Mikaelson, two members of the original vampire family. This is such a trip"
27216,Rebekah, Where's the cure?
27217,Shane, Compulsion won't work. It's a little trick I picked up in Tibet
27218,Rebekah," Right. Well, we'll just have to do this the old-fashioned way. b*at him until he tells you where to find it"
27219,Rebekah," Still glued to your seats? Ooh, it's thick with tension in here. Let's spice things up a bit. Elena, truth or dare?"
27220,Stefan," We're done playing your stupid games, Rebekah"
27221,Rebekah," Truth or dare, Elena? You're compelled. Answer"
27222,Elena, Dare
27223,Rebekah, I dare you to tell Stefan the truth about Damon
27224,Caroline, Seriously?
27225,Elena, Being with Damon makes me happy
27226,Rebekah," Makes you happy? Clowns make you happy, Elena. Dig a little deeper"
27227,Elena," When I'm with him... It feels unpredictable, like... Like I'm free"
27228,Rebekah, And how do you feel when you're with Stefan?
27229,Caroline, Stop!
27230,Rebekah, She can't. She's compelled
27231,Elena," Lately, I feel like I'm a project, like I'm a problem that needs to be fixed. I think I make him sad, and I can't be with someone like that because... When he looks at me, all he sees is a broken toy"
27232,Rebekah, Do you still love Stefan?
27233,Elena, Yes
27234,Rebekah, Are you still in love with Stefan?
27235,Elena, No
27236,Rebekah," Did that hurt, having someone you love drive a dagger through your heart?"
27237,Stefan, Go to hell
27238,Rebekah, Did... that... hurt?
27239,Stefan, Yes
27240,Rebekah, Welcome to the last 900 years of my life
27241,Rebekah," Ah, good, you're here. It was just getting depressing"
27242,Tyler, What the hell is going on?
27243,Rebekah, Listen to the rules carefully. Stay in the building. No vamp-running in the hallways
27244,Caroline, Vamp-running from what?
27245,Rebekah, Turn
27246,Elena, What?!
27247,Caroline, But he can't. He'll lose control
27248,Rebekah," That's the whole point. I've exhausted all your knowledge. Now I have the Professor to help me find the cure, you're just competition. Whoever finds it first gets to decide what to do with it: Use it, share it, destroy it, save it... I want that to be me"
27249,Tyler," But if I turn, I'll k*ll them"
27250,Rebekah," Yes, you will. Turn"
27251,Girl, Did you find your phone?
27252,April, Bonnie? How did you know everyone was here?
27253,Bonnie, Who's everyone? I came to find Shane
27254,April, Did you do a GPS magical spell or something?
27255,April, Rebekah told me that you're a witch
27256,Bonnie, Rebekah? What the hell is going on?
27257,April," Rebekah has Stefan, Elena, and Caroline compelled. She's getting them to actually tell the truth for a change"
27258,Bonnie, What? Shane can't be compelled She'll have him torture him to find out what he knows
27259,April, What are you looking for?
27260,Bonnie, I need salt
27261,April, I think I just saw some. What are you doing?
27262,Bonnie," If this pendant will connect me to Shane, then I can do a protection spell"
27263,Kol, Where is the cure?!
27264,Kol, Where is the cure?
27265,Rebekah, You're human. Why do you want it anyway?
27266,Shane, That's the beauty of this. You can have it. I just want Silas
27267,Kol, No! What do you know about Silas?
27268,Shane," He's the world's first immortal being, who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure and I want to free him"
27269,Rebekah, Stop! He's of no use dead
27270,Kol," Did you not hear what he said? Silas will k*ll us all, sister"
27271,Rebekah, Silas does not exist. He is a fairy tale made up to scare children into eating their vegetables
27272,Shane," Silas is very real. I know where he's buried, and soon I'll have the spell that wakes him"
27273,Kol, Wait a second. You're lying. You can't get to him without his...
27274,Shane," Tombstone? Dozens to die in a bl*od sacrifice? Believe me, I know. I've done it. Those massacres are a pain to engineer"
27275,Rebekah, You're the one who got the council blown up
27276,Shane, It was a noble sacrifice... And temporary because once I raise Silas... Silas will raise the dead. He will bring back every last soul... Who died on his behalf
27277,Kol, No!
27278,Bonnie," April, oh, my God!"
27279,Tyler, Wait. I can't fight it. Aah! Get out of here!
27280,Elena, That door's not gonna hold him
27281,Kol, You should be thanking me
27282,Rebekah, You k*ll my only chance at finding the cure
27283,Kol," Silas on the loose would be hell on earth. And frankly, sister... I don't think you could handle it"
27284,Rebekah, How did you get that?
27285,Kol, Way too easily
27286,Bonnie, Help! Someone help!
27287,Elena," Bonnie, what's going on?"
27288,Bonnie, She needs help
27289,Stefan, What happened?
27290,Bonnie," I did a protection spell, but it accidentally linked Shane to April"
27291,Elena, And you couldn't control it?
27292,Bonnie," I didn't even know I was doing it. Usually I feel pain or I bleed, but this time I just felt more power"
27293,Stefan," It's okay, it's okay. You're ok. You're ok. You're ok. Ok. Bonnie, get her out of the school. Just be careful. Tyler is out there, and he turned"
27294,Bonnie, What about you?
27295,Elena," No, we can't leave. Rebekah's compelled us"
27296,Stefan, Just go. We'll deal with her later
27297,Elena, Stefan…
27298,Stefan, No
27299,Elena," Stefan, we have to talk about this. Please"
27300,Stefan," Talk about what, huh? How many more ways are there for you to rip my heart out?"
27301,Elena, I'm sorry
27302,Stefan," Sorry that it happened, or sorry that I found out?"
27303,Elena," I'm sorry about all of it. I'm really sorry, Stefan. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want that"
27304,Rebekah, Why are my least favorite people always the most durable?
27305,Caroline, Tyler
27306,Tyler, I'm so sorry
27307,Caroline, It wasn't your fault
27308,Tyler," Yes, it was. This whole thing. It's all my fault"
27309,Caroline," No, Tyler"
27310,Tyler, I should have saved her. Leave her out of this
27311,Stefan, Leave her out of this. This is between me and you
27312,Rebekah, You're still protecting her? Must I rip your bleeding heart from your chest and show you the scar tissue that is Elena Gilbert?
27313,Rebekah," There's a solution to all your problems, you know. I could compel him... Erase every memory he has of you. Every day you've spent together, every kiss, every lie, every ounce of pain. I can take away every bit of love he has for you, give you both a clean slate. Just say the word, and I'll make you and all that misery you've caused him disappear"
27314,Stefan, Do it
27315,Rebekah, Excuse me?
27316,Stefan, Erase it all. Every memory
27317,Elena," Stefan, no"
27318,Stefan, I said do it
27319,Rebekah, No. That would be far too easy. I refuse to make you forget her the way Klaus made you forget me
27320,Rebekah, But at least you know how he really feels
27321,Rebekah," Consider your eternity of pain my revenge, Stefan. I've used you for all you're worth. So now you're free to go"
27322,Shane, Turns out I miscalculated. Kol's gonna be a problem
27323,Bonnie," I almost k*ll someone, and that's what you miscalculated? April could've died today"
27324,Shane, That's only because you didn't know the extent of your abilities
27325,Bonnie, My father just became mayor. I can't be out doing black magic
27326,Shane, That's not what expression is
27327,Bonnie, Then what is it?
27328,Shane," It's a way of doing magic that isn't monitored by nature or the spirits. It isn't good nor bad. But it also has no limits, so how you use it is up to you. That's what I'm here for... To help you. Bonnie, listen to me. You are the key to everything. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you"
27329,Damon," Hope your day is going better than mine. Got to say, I'm liking the odds"
27330,Elena, Stefan knows about us
27331,Damon, Oh. How'd he take it?
27332,Elena, How do you think?
27333,Damon," I'm thinking, for the first time all week, I'm happy to be at camp nowhere"
27334,Elena, How's Jeremy?
27335,Damon, That depends on how much you trust me
27336,Elena, You know that I trust you
27337,Damon, Then I think he's gonna get through this just fine
27338,Elena, Thanks for looking out for him
27339,Damon," Yeah, well, I told them if they were good, I'd buy them both ice cream, so look, I got to go"
27340,Elena," Not yet. Something happened today. I realized something about you, about us. And you can say that it's the sire bond, and you know what? Maybe... maybe it is, but I'm telling you it's the most real thing that I've ever felt in my entire life. I love you, Damon. I love you"
27341,Damon, Look. I'm going to get this cure for you. And I'm gonna have to do things you're not gonna like
27342,Elena, Damon…
27343,Damon," But listen carefully. Get in your car, right now. Come to me"
27344,Elena, I'll be there soon
27345,Stefan, You let yourself in
27346,Rebekah, You called me. Should I be checking for hidden daggers?
27347,Stefan, Do you still want to find the cure?
27348,Rebekah," More than anything. I want to ram it down Niklaus' throat and look into his eyes as he realizes he's mortal again. But Shane's dead and you are useless, so I'm right back where I started"
27349,Stefan, Shane's not dead
27350,Rebekah, But I watched Kol impale him
27351,Stefan," Well, you probably shouldn't have left him alone. Bonnie did a little spell. He's perfectly fine"
27352,Rebekah, You didn't have to tell me that. Why am I really here?
27353,Stefan," You were right. I'm gonna be here for an eternity, and I will go insane if I don't know how Elena truly feels about my brother"
27354,Rebekah," If you really want the cure, you should know that Shane has an agenda, and it's a dark one. He said he organized dozens of people to die in sacrifice. He admitted to the council expl*si*n where 12 people died, and I'm guessing it's not a coincidence that 12 hybrids died at the hand of my brother"
27355,Stefan, 12… Channeling the energy from a mass death is used in witchcraft to perform dark spells. It's called expression. Shane admitted all this to you?
27356,Rebekah, Proudly
27357,Stefan," Well, then I guess we'll have to figure out how to manage him while we find the cure for ourselves"
27358,Rebekah," ‘'We''? There's no ""we,"" Stefan "
27359,Stefan," Listen, I hate my brother, and you hate yours. But Damon's got Jeremy, and Klaus has the sword, and Shane has Bonnie. You and I are the only ones left with nothing. You said it yourself, right? Whoever finds the cure first gets to decide what to do with it. What do you say? You want to be partners?"
27360,April, My father had no reason to k*ll 11 people. He had no reason to k*ll himself. He loved me. He loved Mystic Falls. He was brainwashed into sparking that fire. Professor Shane organized his death and the 11 others who died with him. It's time this entire town started telling the truth
27361,Klaus, I was beginning to worry you boys wouldn't find the place
27362,Jeremy, What the hell…?
27363,Matt, Did you k*ll all these people?
27364,Klaus, Not exactly. They're in transition. k*ll them is your job
27365,Jeremy, You said you were going to convince Klaus to do this another way
27366,Damon, I thought about it. And then I realized his idea was better
27367,Jeremy, No way. I'm not doing it
27368,Klaus, What makes you think you have a choice? You have to k*ll vampires to complete the hunter's mark. Mark equals cure
27369,Damon," You're in a bar full of almost vampires, so get your hunt on"
27370,Jeremy, Screw you. You said I wouldn't have to k*ll any innocent people
27371,Damon," Jeremy, they're not people"
27372,Klaus," Enough! Have at it, or else"
27373,Jeremy," I don't take orders from you, dick. Hunters can't be compelled"
27374,Klaus," You're right. I can't compel you, but if your conscience is getting in the way, then allow me to make this easy for you because I can compel them. I'm gonna give you a two-minute head start. Then I'm gonna send every vampire in here after you. You k*ll them, or they k*ll your friend... Matt"
27375,Matt, Wait a second
27376,Damon," No, no. You turn them, he k*ll them. That was the deal, Klaus"
27377,Klaus, I'm taking artistic license
27378,Damon, You know he can't take them all on at the same time
27379,Klaus," With you as his coach, he'll be fine. It's Matt I'm worried about"
27380,Damon," Jeremy, go get the w*apon out of the car. I'll be right behind you. Both of you"
27381,Klaus," If I hear an engine start, I'll k*ll Matt myself!"
27382,Jeremy, Are you okay?
27383,Matt, Yeah. I just need a second
27384,Jeremy, We don't have a second. They can smell your bl*od. We need to go
27385,Damon," Don't hesitate. You're lucky it was me. Otherwise, you two would be dead"
27386,Jeremy, You set me up
27387,Damon, I was trying to get this thing over with. You're the one that pissed off Klaus. Now you have to fight your way out of it
27388,Jeremy, Where are the other vampires?
27389,Damon," They're newbies. They're still trying to figure out how to track, which means you have two seconds to get ready to fight"
27390,Jeremy," The lake house is this way. If we can get there, they won't be able to get inside"
27391,Damon, Wait. You want to run?
27392,Jeremy, They're gonna k*ll Matt
27393,Damon, Fine. Get out of here. I'll slow them down
27394,Matt, Jeremy?! Where are you?
27395,Jeremy, Keep going. We're almost there
27396,Elena, Are you ok? Oh my god
27397,Jeremy, Get to the house! Hurry!
27398,Elena," Jeremy, what's going on?"
27399,Jeremy, They're coming
27400,Jeremy, Sun's up. They're long gone
27401,Elena, What the hell were you thinking? All I asked you to do was to teach him how to fight
27402,Damon, He's not the best student in the world
27403,Jeremy, Wait. Now this is my fault?
27404,Damon," Stop talking. Look. I know you're angry, but my way was the easiest, fastest, and safest way to complete his mark to get you the cure"
27405,Elena," I don't care about the cure, Damon, not if it means putting the people that I love in danger"
27406,Damon, Hey. There would have been no danger if he hadn't gone all bleeding hearts
27407,Elena, He k*ll someone. These were innocent people
27408,Damon," But the mark grew, didn't it?"
27409,Elena," Ok. Look. We need a plan There's a group of compelled vampires out there, and as soon as the sun goes down, they're gonna come after Matt, so we have to find a way to protect him"
27410,Damon," Yes, I know, but there will be no problem when big Jer and I here go on a hunting expedition. Elena, I know it's tragic, I get it, but we also agree that he had to k*ll them. Now we have added incentive, so you take the least most valuable player home, and Jeremy and I will finish this"
27411,Elena, I'm sorry. Are you saying that I should leave him here with you?
27412,Damon," Trust me. I will keep him safe, ok?"
27413,Stefan," Ahem. I know you were, uh, daggered for a little while, but, uh, knocking is still a thing"
27414,Rebekah," So is writing in your diary apparently. I'm just checking for doubts. You can never be too cautious when it comes to love. One minute, you're begging me to compel Elena from your mind, and the next, I'm up coffin creek with a dagger in my back"
27415,Stefan," Right. Well, you can read it all you want. I'm done with her"
27416,Rebekah," Until we find the cure, right? Hey. I'm talking to you"
27417,Stefan," Oh, I know you are. I'm ignoring you"
27418,Rebekah, Look. We're at a bit of a disadvantage in this whole race for the cure. Team Klaus has Jeremy the hunter; team Shane has Bonnie the witch
27419,Stefan," If you're here to remind me of our last place status, I'm very well aware"
27420,Rebekah," Actually I have a plan. The cure is buried with Silas, that ancient evil guy my brother Kol is afraid of. Shane was so eager to prove his existence that he gave away that he has one of the keys to resurrecting him, his headstone"
27421,Stefan, I see. You want to steal it
27422,Rebekah," Yes. And then team Shane will have to join team Rebekah, and team Klaus will be left out in the cold where he belongs"
27423,Shane," You know, just because your eyes are closed doesn't mean you're meditating. Come on. Use your breath. Use your breath to calm your nerves"
27424,Bonnie, Great. So now I can't even meditate right? What else can I fail?
27425,Shane," Bonnie, you didn't fail"
27426,Bonnie, I did an expression spell that almost k*ll April
27427,Shane," Exactly. Almost. Failing would have been actually k*ll her. You got, like, a d-minus"
27428,Bonnie," It's not funny. I have all this power now, and I'm worried I won't be able to control it"
27429,Shane," Bonnie, look at me. I'm here with you. You don't have anything to worry about. You are strong, you are focused. You are in complete control. You're here with me"
27430,Bonnie, I'm in complete control
27431,Bonnie, Sheriff?
27432,Sheriff Forbes," Bonnie, I'm gonna need you to go"
27433,Shane, What the hell are you doing?
27434,Sheriff Forbes, We need to ask you a few questions
27435,Shane, Are you serious? I'm sure I can answer without the handcuffs. Come on. This isn't even your jurisdiction
27436,Sheriff Forbes," Well, then I guess we better get you to Mystic Falls ASAP"
27437,Bonnie, Wait. Why are you doing this?
27438,Sheriff Forbes, That's something you should ask your dad
27439,Jeremy, You really think they went back to the bar?
27440,Damon, Where else are they gonna go? It's all cabins and vacation homes. They can't get in anywhere. All right. There you go
27441,Jeremy, Fine. Let's get this over with
27442,Damon," Listen. Just go one at a time, only sh**t for the heart, don't hesitate, and don't miss"
27443,Jeremy, Save the teaching moment. Elena's not here. You don't have to pretend like you give a damn about me
27444,Damon," I'm trying to keep you alive, dumbass. Come on"
27445,Damon, Something's not right
27446,Damon, Looks like we're gonna have to find some new vampires. What a waste
27447,Damon, What the hell happened?
27448,Kol, I confess. I did it
27449,Jeremy, Kol
27450,Kol," Jeremy, good to see you, mate. Sorry about the mess. It was a little crowded when I arrived, and I prefer more intimate gatherings. We 3 need to have a little chat. Care for a drink?"
27451,Damon," He's underage, and I don't like you, so let's just cut to it"
27452,Kol, My brother bragged about his plan to complete Jeremy's hunter's mark. It was easy enough to track this lot down. They were all hiding in the shadows. Now k*ll young vampires is easy or old ones for that matter
27453,Damon, Why? What's it to you either way?
27454,Kol," Because, you fools, in your zeal to find the cure, you risk waking someone very dangerous"
27455,Damon, Oh. You must be talking about Silas
27456,Kol, What do you know of him?
27457,Damon, Nothing. Don't want to. Not our problem
27458,Kol," Isn't it? A few hundred years back, I came across a group that worshiped Silas. His followers told me that he would rise again, and when he did, he would trigger the end of all time. You know, being an immortal, you can see why I'm opposed to time's ending. I m*rder all of them, and now here you are willing to risk raising him in your search for the cure. I can't exactly sit back and let that happen, can I?"
27459,Damon," We're not gonna back off the cure because you were told one too many scary bedtime stories, you idiot"
27460,Kol," Jeremy, we were mates in Colorado. You're a smart lad. Why don't you call off this imbecilic treasure hunt?"
27461,Jeremy," I'm not calling anything off, mate"
27462,Kol," Well, I could k*ll you, but then I'd have to deal with the hunter's curse, and I... I don't particularly feel like being haunted for the next century. Better idea. I'll just rip off your arms"
27463,Damon," Jeremy, run!"
27464,Stefan, Well... Headstone's not here
27465,Rebekah," Don't ripper out on me. We'll find it. Oh, you're all bottled up. You need a release. Maybe we can find you a voodoo doll or something"
27466,Rebekah, Ah. This should do the trick. Exactly what you need. The Professor's stash of herbs
27467,Stefan, Not interested
27468,Rebekah, What happened to you? You were so much fun in the twenties
27469,Stefan, I was a psychotic k*ll with no emotions in the 1920s
27470,Rebekah," You may have been a k*ll, but you were far from emotionless, Stefan. You had a blast. I know you remember. The jazz, the booze, our little table at Gloria's. Don't make me compel it out of you"
27471,Stefan, All right. Um... I guess we had a little bit of fun
27472,Rebekah," Thank you. So now that we've established that fun is, in fact, possible, maybe you'd like to start having some. Don't worry about the Professor. He won't be back any time soon. I made sure of that"
27473,Shane, You're accusing me of orchestrating a mass m*rder? Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?
27474,Sheriff Forbes, It's Mystic Falls. It's actually one of the least ridiculous things I've heard
27475,Bonnie," He already explained this, dad. Pastor Young came to him for help. He was crazy"
27476,Rudy," No. He was grief-stricken, and Shane took advantage of it. And somehow talked him into k*ll a house full of people"
27477,Bonnie, It doesn't make any sense
27478,Rudy," I've met people like this, Bonnie. They're fast-talking, they're charismatic, they're manipulators. They prey on the weak-minded"
27479,Bonnie," Mmm. And you're worried that's what he's doing to me. That's why you brought him in, isn't it?"
27480,Rudy, No. We brought him in because April young told us what he did. Rebekah Mikaelson confirmed it. He confessed to her
27481,Bonnie, I'm going in there
27482,Rudy," Bonnie, no, you're not"
27483,Bonnie," If he's gonna tell anyone what he did, it's me. Unless of course you think I'm too weak-minded"
27484,Sheriff Forbes," Bonnie, now is not the time"
27485,Rudy, Let her talk
27486,Shane, I think your dad's confused about the format of the parent-teacher conference
27487,Bonnie, I'm so sorry. Rebekah told them you confessed. I know she's lying
27488,Shane," You know, the truth is, she's not"
27489,Elena," I'm so sorry. Listen. When I asked you to stay to Jeremy, I never thought..."
27490,Matt," what did you expect, Elena? It's Damon"
27491,Elena, I never wanted anyone to get hurt
27492,Matt," Well, then you shouldn't have left him in charge. Look. I'm sorry. I know you didn't have a choice... sire bond and all"
27493,Elena, Sire bond doesn't work like that
27494,Matt," All I know, Elena, is that the old you would have never left Jeremy with Damon, especially after what happened last night"
27495,Elena, Jeremy?
27496,Jeremy," Elena, we're in trouble"
27497,Elena," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Where's Damon?"
27498,Jeremy," Listen to me. Kol attacked us. I barely got away, but he's got Damon"
27499,Klaus, A bit ironic you coming to me for help. Weren't your friends just trying to bury me in a cement tomb?
27500,Elena, This is your fault. You started this when you forced Jeremy to k*ll those vampires
27501,Klaus," And my little brat of a brother has gone and made things worse. Well, he never did like Damon. I suppose I should do something, shouldn't I?"
27502,Elena," Call him off, Klaus"
27503,Klaus," You are in no position to make demands, love. Whilst I'd like to cure you to make more hybrids, I do have other reasons for finding the cure, not the least of which is destroying it so you lot can't use it against me"
27504,Elena," Whatever our differences, we want the same thing. Please. Klaus, I'm begging you"
27505,Klaus," Little brother. Just two days home, and I'm told you've already gone and made a mess"
27506,Kol," Come on, Nik. I was only having some fun"
27507,Klaus, Those vampires were for my hunter
27508,Kol," Well, make some more. There's no shortage of people"
27509,Klaus, Where's Damon Salvatore?
27510,Kol, I gave him a good and proper b*at just for old time's sake
27511,Klaus," Yes. Well, you've had your fun. Now let him go and come home. Avoid any more trouble, or you'll find yourself back in a box"
27512,Kol, Hey. No need to be nasty about it
27513,Klaus," On the contrary, I find nastiness to be essential whenever my siblings try to sabotage me. Listen closely, Kol. Stay away from the Gilbert boy. Understand?"
27514,Kol, Fine. I won't touch him. You have my word
27515,Kol," Very good, darling. Now stab yourself a little bit further"
27516,Damon," If you're gonna k*ll me, do it like a man"
27517,Kol, I don't want to k*ll you. I just wanted to make sure you could be compelled
27518,Damon, I'm gonna rip out your spleen
27519,Kol," You ought to be thanking me. You don't really want the cure found. You fancy Elena. I mean, even more now that she's a vampire. Admit it. The last vestige of her humanity is her annoying little brother Jeremy, and deep, deep down, I bet you want him dead, don't you?"
27520,Damon, Nope
27521,Kol, You're lying. I bet you'd love to rip his head right off... And I'm gonna give you your wish
27522,Kol," You're not gonna remember what I say, but you're going to find Jeremy Gilbert, and when you do, you're going to k*ll him"
27523,Elena," Jeremy, it's over. You can put all this away"
27524,Jeremy, Klaus still wants me to finish the mark. He's not gonna stop
27525,Elena," Ok. Well, Damon's gonna be back soon, and then we can figure something out"
27526,Jeremy, Seriously? You still trust Damon?
27527,Elena, He saved your life
27528,Jeremy, He saved the map to the cure. He couldn't care less about me
27529,Elena, I care about you
27530,Jeremy," Don't. Whatever's inside of me that makes me want to hunt, right now it's on overdrive"
27531,Elena, Jeremy
27532,Jeremy," I'm sorry. I know what I have to do, Elena. I really want to get that cure for you, but…. I just... I don't how I'm gonna do this"
27533,Stefan, So much random crap in here
27534,Rebekah," Crap, maybe. Random, no. Looks like Shane has a bit of an afterlife fetish. Hopi prayer feathers, the Han dynasty soul vase, and that is a Polynesian sacrificial kn*fe"
27535,Rebekah," Brutal way to die, but at least you appease the gods"
27536,Stefan, Since when did you become such an artifact expert?
27537,Rebekah," I enjoy other cultures, Stefan. I know that might be hard for you to understand considering you dated a child who only thinks about herself. Still a sensitive subject, I see. Do you know why I wouldn't compel Elena from your memory?"
27538,Stefan, Because you wanted me to suffer
27539,Rebekah," I did. It's the only way you'll learn. It took me a thousand years and hundreds of betrayals to realize that love, caring ruins you"
27540,Stefan, That's awfully bleak
27541,Rebekah," Quite the opposite. It's liberating actually. You know why we had so much fun in the twenties, Stefan? Because we didn't care. We just did what felt good... drinking, feeding, sex"
27542,Stefan, The sex wasn't good because we didn't care. It was good because you're crazy. Crazy sex is always good
27543,Rebekah, You were hardly the model of sanity. Stop... Caring
27544,Rebekah, Good. You found it. Question is who are you?
27545,Elena, What happened? Are you ok?
27546,Damon, Kol happened
27547,Elena, Thank God you both got away. If Kol had taken Jeremy
27548,Damon, Is he here? I just want to talk to him really fast
27549,Elena, He's at the grill. He wanted to check on Matt
27550,Damon," Well, I should go apologize to him. I was... I was pretty tough on him today"
27551,Bonnie, Told my dad to give us a minute. Camera's off. You can talk
27552,Shane, Are you sure about that?
27553,Bonnie, Yeah. I don't lie. I'm not you
27554,Shane, Look. I always gonna tell you the truth. I just kept putting it off because I was worried how you'd react
27555,Bonnie, Bad. That's how I react to m*rder
27556,Shane," I'm not a k*ll, Bonnie. Pastor Young was depressed..."
27557,Bonnie, I've heard this. Skip to the part where you convince him to m*ssacre 11 people
27558,Shane, It wasn't a m*ssacre. It was a ritual. It was something necessary to raise Silas and get the cure that your friends so desperately want
27559,Bonnie, If they knew people had to die...
27560,Shane, it doesn't matter if they die. Silas will bring them back
27561,Bonnie, You're crazy
27562,Shane, I'm not crazy. I'm just passionate
27563,Bonnie, You're full on crazy
27564,Shane," Do you remember our first session? It was about your grams, right? You thought every time you did magic you were causing her pain. Aren't you curious what's happening to her now? Wouldn't you like to see her again?"
27565,Damon, Don't you ever take a night off?
27566,Matt," I took two days off to help you out at the lake house, remember? I almost got k*ll"
27567,Damon, Where's Jeremy?
27568,Matt, He's in the back I think
27569,Elena, Are you doing ok?
27570,Matt, Yeah. All things considered
27571,Elena," Damon. Are you all right? What's going on? Damon, what is wrong with you?"
27572,Damon, It was Kol. He must have compelled me. If I find Jeremy... I might k*ll him
27573,Damon," Jeremy… Get out of here! Do you hear me? Don't stop. Kol compelled me. There's nothing I can do! You can't hide in here, Jer. If I find you, you're dead. Jeremy, are you listening to me? You better run! I am coming to k*ll you. You need to go now!"
27574,Rebekah," All you have to do to make it stop is tell me who sent you. You're full of vervain, so I know you haven't been compelled"
27575,Stefan, Or maybe somebody compelled him before he ingested it
27576,Rebekah, He was after the headstone. We need to know who sent him
27577,Stefan," Ok. Fine. So we take him home, wait till the vervain is out of his system, and then compel him and get whatever information we want"
27578,Rebekah, That's not a bad idea
27579,Stefan, He just bit off his own tongue
27580,Rebekah, So he does know something
27581,Stefan, I guess he was compelled
27582,Rebekah, Was it my bastard brother or yours?
27583,Stefan, Maybe it's option number 3. There's another team in the race
27584,Bonnie," You're saying if I help you raise Silas you can bring my grams back? Don't play on my guilt, Shane"
27585,Shane, I'm not playing on anything. This is the truth. You told me what happened. Your reckless use of magic is the reason...
27586,Bonnie, Don't
27587,Shane, Is the reason those spirits are torturing her on the other side
27588,Bonnie, Don't
27589,Shane, Hurting her again and again and again
27590,Bonnie, I said don't!
27591,Shane," You can't stop, can you? All this power that you're feeling, you actually like it, don't you?"
27592,Shane," Aah! Aah! Ugh. Look at yourself, Bonnie. Look at yourself, Bonnie"
27593,Rudy," Bonnie, what are you doing?"
27594,Bonnie, Get out! Get out of here!
27595,Rudy," Bonnie, stop!"
27596,Shane," You can't reason with her, mayor. She's lost control"
27597,Rudy," Bonnie, baby, baby. Please. Do something!"
27598,Shane," Bonnie… Bonnie, look at me! Now take a deep breath. I'm right here with you. You are in complete control. That's it"
27599,Shane, Your daughter... Is a prodigy. With my guidance... She'll be one of the most powerful witches in the world... But without it... whew... she's a time b*mb
27600,Rebekah," Hello, Elena"
27601,Elena, What did you to Stefan?
27602,Rebekah," Rescued him from his old, dull life, but it keeps calling. Stefan's not in the mood to talk right now"
27603,Elena," Then he can listen. I know might not care about me right now, Stefan, but Kol compelled Damon to k*ll Jeremy. They're somewhere in the tunnels, and I... it's one giant maze down here, and I can't find them, so if you still care about the cure or about Jeremy, then maybe you can come help"
27604,Elena, Okay
27605,Rebekah, That is an interesting predicament for both of us
27606,Damon," Did you miss the part where I said I'm compelled? Don't stop! Seriously? You're being hunted by a vampire, and now you're bleeding?"
27607,Damon," Dumb move, Jer. You can't fight me in closed quarters"
27608,Jeremy, It was worth a sh*t
27609,Damon," You're gonna have to sh**t me, Jeremy, in the heart. I'm not gonna be able to stop myself. Jeremy, you are a hunter. You know what to do. Do it. Do it!"
27610,Damon," He sh*t me in the head. Stupid idiot... Borderline brain-dead moron! That was dumb, Jeremy. Should have k*ll me when you had the chance"
27611,Rebekah," Going somewhere? I would if I were you. If Damon k*ll the hunter, Nik will not be pleased"
27612,Kol, I told Nik I wouldn't touch the kid. I didn't
27613,Rebekah," Oh. Well, that was clever. I'm sure he'll really appreciate it"
27614,Kol, You'd really dagger me?
27615,Rebekah," If I do, Damon's compulsion ends and this is all over"
27616,Kol," And then you're no better than Niklaus. Daggering siblings when you disagree with them... look at what this family has become. I mean, Elijah won't even show his face he's so disgusted by our bickering. This cure has ruined us, and it hasn't even been found yet. Just imagine what would happen if it is"
27617,Rebekah, This family was ruined long before we knew about the cure. Kol! I won't let you raise Silas
27618,Klaus," Enough of this foolishness. Put it down, Kol"
27619,Rebekah, He was going to k*ll me
27620,Klaus," Well, then, I think you need a lesson in how to properly dagger a sibling"
27621,Rebekah, Burn in hell
27622,Elena," Damon, stop! I know that you don't want to hurt Jeremy, so please stop"
27623,Damon, I can't
27624,Elena," Yes, you can. You're strong enough to resist the compulsion. I know that you are"
27625,Damon," Why, because Stefan did?"
27626,Elena," Because I love you, because you love me. You'd do anything for me, so please... Do this for me"
27627,Damon," I'm sorry, Elena"
27628,Elena, Damon!
27629,Damon, Jeremy. sh**t now
27630,Stefan," Hey, brother. Long time, no see"
27631,Stefan, You're welcome
27632,Stefan," Easy there, buddy. You lost a lot of bl*od"
27633,Damon, So you bled me out?
27634,Stefan," Yeah. I didn't really have much of a choice. Kol's compulsion is still in effect, so you need to stay locked up. We don't have any vervain, so... This was the only way I could weaken you"
27635,Damon," You sound real torn up about it. Shouldn't we be going after Kol, make him decompel me"
27636,Stefan," Yeah, yeah, sure. That sounds easy enough, Damon. I'll get right on that"
27637,Damon, At least let me see Elena
27638,Stefan," Come on. You know you can't do that. With the sire bond, all you have to do is tell her to let you out of here"
27639,Damon," You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"
27640,Stefan," It's better for Elena if you stay in here for now, at least until we find the cure, and then once she's no longer sired and you're no longer compelled, you can both do whatever the hell you want"
27641,Damon," Stefan, wait. Stefan!"
27642,Stefan, Going to see Damon?
27643,Elena, I need to talk to him
27644,Stefan," Well, you can't. He'll just ask you to let him out"
27645,Elena, I won't let him out
27646,Stefan, You won't have a choice. You're sired. Is that all?
27647,Elena," Stefan, what are you doing with Rebekah? She tried to k*ll me"
27648,Stefan," And this will be the second time that Damon tried to k*ll Jeremy. So I guess nobody's perfect, right?"
27649,Elena, Are you trying to punish me? I don't know how many times I can apologize
27650,Stefan," I never asked you to. You can do whatever you want, Elena. I really don't care"
27651,Elena," You're hurt. You're hurt, and you're acting out, Stefan. This isn't you"
27652,Stefan, Sure it is. You've just never seen me like this. You don't know what I look like when I'm not in love with you. I'll let Damon know you stopped by
27653,Bonnie, I owe you an apology
27654,Rudy, You don't owe me anything. I'm not happy to be right. I'm gonna get you some help
27655,Bonnie," Help? Dad, I'm ok"
27656,Rudy, Are you kidding me?
27657,Bonnie," I got angry I admit, but I knew what I was doing"
27658,Rudy," You lost control, and Shane said..."
27659,Bonnie, Didn't we just establish that we couldn't trust him? He's trying to get under your skin
27660,Rudy," The only thing that got under my skin is what I saw, which is my daughter using dangerous magic! And the fact that you don't think you need help means you need it even more"
27661,Klaus," Good evening, Gilbert clan"
27662,Elena," What do you want, Klaus?"
27663,Klaus," I've come to fetch my hunter. Seeing as how my brother's become a liability, Jeremy will be safer with me"
27664,Jeremy, I think I'll pass. I've k*ll enough people for you today
27665,Klaus," You think you're safer here? Hmm. Clearly you don't know Kol. He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, as strange as it may seem, I'm your best bet"
27666,Elena," Sorry, but I think we'd rather take our chances"
27667,Klaus," Fine, but when Kol does come... and he will come… be sure to let me know, preferably before he burns your nice little home to the ground. And as for you, hunter, there's no shortage of people to turn and loved ones to threaten, so sleep well. We'll plan on finishing our work tomorrow"
27668,Rebekah, Sure. Just barge right in
27669,Stefan, Oh. I thought not knocking was our thing. You didn't dagger Kol.
27670,Rebekah," Well, the white oak stake pointed at my heart made things a little difficult. I do believe my brother Kol has finally lost his mind"
27671,Stefan," That's all right. Jeremy's still alive, and I took care of Damon. So where'd you put it?"
27672,Rebekah, The headstone. Some place safe
27673,Stefan, Wasn't really our deal
27674,Rebekah," Well, considering that you've betrayed me twice and I've betrayed you never, I think I'm acting brilliantly, especially since we have no idea why that guy was looking for it. Did you work things out with Elena?"
27675,Stefan, Do you care?
27676,Rebekah, Nope. Just trying to figure out why you're here
27677,Stefan, Do you even have to ask?
27678,Rebekah," No feelings, no attachments"
27679,Stefan, None… Whatsoever
27680,Jeremy," This is never gonna end. If Kol doesn't k*ll me first, then Klaus is just gonna force me to k*ll more innocent people. How many is it gonna take, 10, 100?"
27681,Elena," If you k*ll one original vampire, their entire sire line will die with them. That's thousands, maybe tens of thousands of vampires. Kol compelled Damon to k*ll you. You're gonna k*ll Kol instead"
27682,Klaus, Leaving so soon?
27683,Rebekah, I don't appreciate you invading my privacy like some kind of creeping Tom
27684,Klaus," Well, I apologize for breaking up this sordid little tryst, but I do have some urgent business. Or have you forgotten that our paranoid brother Kol is running around with a white oak stake and homicide on the brain?"
27685,Rebekah, He tried to k*ll me last night. I didn't forget
27686,Klaus," Yes. Well, unfortunately, he seems to have absconded with my set of daggers"
27687,Rebekah," Oh, poor Nik. However will you get your way without your precious daggers? They were so handy when you wanted to end a conversation with one of us"
27688,Klaus," Kol's irrational fear of Silas has pushed him off the edge. We need to put him down before he does any more damage. Now, I know you have the last dagger, and I know you have some white ash, so hand it over"
27689,Rebekah," Hmm. And leave myself unprotected? You can file that request under ""no chance in hell."" Be gone by the time I've showered. Lurkers aren't welcome here"
27690,Klaus," I need that dagger, Stefan. Talk some sense into her."
27691,Stefan, Why don't you talk some sense into her? I'm headed home to play prison guard to Damon. He's on lockdown ever since Kol compelled him to k*ll Jeremy last night
27692,Klaus," You see? That's my point exactly. If you let Kol run free, then Jeremy won't live to see his junior prom, and we can kiss our map to the cure good-bye. But if you help me dagger Kol, Damon will be uncompelled, Jeremy will live, and we'll all be on our merry way to a human Elena"
27693,Elena, Where are you?
27694,Bonnie," I told Caroline I'd take her place at decade dance prep, but none of the rest of you showed"
27695,Elena," I know. I'm sorry. I had to, though. I've got Jeremy under house arrest because Kol wants to k*ll him. And Klaus wants to take him on some vampire-slaying road trip. And since neither of them were invited in, it's the only place that I can keep him safe"
27696,Bonnie, Why does it sound like you're under fire?
27697,Elena, Apparently I'm living in a fraternity house now
27698,Jeremy, I'm training
27699,Matt, Me too
27700,Elena, Train yourself to do some dishes. And put these w*apon away before someone tries to use one on me
27701,Bonnie," Well, it's hard for me to look forward to this dance while you're trapped in your house"
27702,Elena," Listen, I have a plan to put an end to all of this. I want Jeremy to k*ll Kol"
27703,Bonnie, You want him to k*ll an original?
27704,Elena," Think about it. Kol's sire line must stretch to the moon by now. If Jeremy k*ll Kol, every vampire that he's ever turned, not to mention everyone that they've turned, will die, which means the Hunter's mark will be complete, and we'll have our key to finding the cure"
27705,Bonnie, I'm on my way. We'll figure it out. Do you think Caroline will notice if there's only 89 red balloons?
27706,Elena," Actually, probably yes"
27707,Elena, sorry
27708,Bonnie, What happened?
27709,Elena, I don't know. There's something in the water
27710,Bonnie, Are you serious? You dumped vervain into the water supply? Where did you even get it?
27711,Rudy, I have my sources. I'm also reinstating the curfew and canceling all town events
27712,Bonnie," Dad, there's the dance tonight"
27713,Rudy, Not anymore
27714,Bonnie, Are you serious?
27715,Rudy," Honey, I'm trying to protect you, not punish you. The well-being of this town is my job now"
27716,Bonnie," No. Dad, it's mine, and I've been doing fine without you getting involved"
27717,Rudy," You've been doing fine? Would you like me to read you all the names of the people that have gone missing or died in tragic accidents in your senior year alone? Head straight home, please. We're having a family meeting"
27718,Kol, No one can get to the cure if you're too dead to find it
27719,Damon," Gonna snap my neck again? Because I woke up feeling completely m*rder, and I'm pretty sure that it's safe to set me free"
27720,Damon, You practically bled me dry. At least spring for a bag or something. I'm thirsty
27721,Damon, Not exactly what I had in mind
27722,Klaus, Hello mate
27723,Damon, What the hell are you doing here?
27724,Klaus, babysitting
27725,Stefan," Give him a vial of bl*od every couple of hours so he doesn't desiccate. If he gets too much strength back or if he just annoys you, bleed him out again"
27726,Damon, Silent treatment uh? He's still pissed at me for sleeping with Elena
27727,Klaus," Are you sure about that? Because I caught him trying to sneak out of Rebekah's bed this morning, which would suggest to me that he's moved on"
27728,Damon," Well, well. Looks like my brother ripped out a page of my revenge sex handbook"
27729,Stefan," Well, why don't you two enjoy your little, uh, villain bonding time? I'll let you know when I get the dagger from Rebekah"
27730,Stefan, Damon's fine. With all the creature comforts he deserves
27731,Elena, That's not why I called. Kol just tried to k*ll Bonnie
27732,Stefan, What? Is she ok?
27733,Elena," Yeah, just shaken up. She managed to hold him off, but Kol seems pretty intent on m*rder anyone who's looking for that cure"
27734,Stefan, Yeah. Klaus has me trying to convince Rebekah to give up her dagger so we can take care of Kol
27735,Elena, I don't want to just dagger Kol. I want Jeremy to k*ll him
27736,Stefan, What did you say?
27737,Elena, Bonnie says she's got all this crazy new power. She thinks she can hold him long enough for Jeremy to get a clean sh*t
27738,Stefan," And then what, huh? Klaus and Rebekah will k*ll every single one of us out of spite. They may be dysfunctional, bickering lunatics, but they stick together no matter what"
27739,Elena, That's why you need to find the dagger and use it on Rebekah. She can't come looking for revenge if she's lying in a box
27740,Stefan, I can't do that
27741,Elena," I know you can't because vampires can't use the dagger, but Matt can. It's not like she doesn't deserve it. And Bonnie thinks that she can get Klaus out of the picture, too, at least temporarily. Once we get this cure, none of this will matter because we can use it against them"
27742,Stefan," All right, fine, but how do you plan to lure Kol in?"
27743,Kol," Jeremy Gilbert. Nice to see I'm still on your speed dial, mate. Hey, you want to meet up at the batting cages in Denver?"
27744,Elena," Actually, it's Elena Gilbert"
27745,Kol," What a treat. Yeah, I was just thinking of all the clever ways I could have your brother k*ll, but I'd settle for ripping off his illustrated arm instead"
27746,Elena, I need to talk to you--in person. I want to call a truce in the name of Silas
27747,Kol, You want to talk about Silas?
27748,Kol, I'll tell you what. How about I come to you?
27749,Kol," Open the door and invite me in. I'm waiting. Let me in, and let's talk truce. Hello?"
27750,Elena, Wouldn't it be kind of stupid to invite you in?
27751,Kol," On the contrary. I can't k*ll your brother with my own two hands, or I'll suffer the hunter's curse and spend the next 20 years trying to off myself in gruesome ways. And I've heard that vervain's back in town, so I can't compel you to k*ll him either. So I think it's fair to say you're semi-safe, for now"
27752,Jeremy, I'm the only one who can invite him inside
27753,Kol," He's right, obviously"
27754,Kol," You'd think being alive for over 1,000 years would teach me some manners, but I couldn't resist stopping by"
27755,Elena," If I let you in, my brother goes. You're not getting near him"
27756,Kol, Fair enough
27757,Jeremy, You can come in
27758,Kol," No gold medal for bravery, I see. Another thing I love about the modern age is music anytime you like. So, is the part where you offer me a drink so we can have a proper chat?"
27759,Rebekah," The colors, the fabric, the eighties were just tragic. You know, I think shoulder pads rival 17th-century Puritan smocks for crimes against fashion"
27760,Stefan, Looking for something to wear to the dance?
27761,Rebekah, Why? Are you asking me to a date?
27762,Stefan," Actually, it was canceled"
27763,Rebekah, So why are you here? Back for more dagger talk?
27764,Stefan, Somebody has some trust issues
27765,Rebekah, It's called a healthy skepticism. I know you were trying to sneak out this morning. I'm not stupid
27766,Stefan, Sorry. I'm still trying to get used to this
27767,Rebekah, Do you regret it?
27768,Stefan, No
27769,Rebekah, Do you want it to happen again?
27770,Stefan, Maybe
27771,Rebekah, Even if I don't give you the dagger?
27772,Stefan, You think that I would sleep with you just to get the dagger?
27773,Rebekah," Don't give me that innocent look. You've done plenty to me in the name of getting what you want. Well, I guess I should pack up these racks. Just another failed attempt at getting to a high-school dance"
27774,Stefan, Why do you care so much about a high school dance?
27775,Rebekah, I don't. I was just bored
27776,Stefan," Right. Well, we can still go. If you want?"
27777,Rebekah," Not if it's canceled, we can't"
27778,Stefan, Since when do you care about the rules?
27779,Klaus," You know, none of this would be an issue if you'd have just done your job properly. I was perfectly willing to let you train Jeremy"
27780,Damon," No, you weren't. Are you kidding? You got there on day two. Do you know how hard it is to get these X-Box brains to focus?"
27781,Klaus," And then when I turned a room full of barflies into vampires for him to slaughter, you let Kol k*ll them"
27782,Damon," Your brother problem, not mine, buddy"
27783,Klaus," And whose bright idea was it to saddle Jeremy with a conscience, hmm?"
27784,Damon," Well, we couldn't have him trying to stake Elena in her sleep, now, could we?"
27785,Klaus," Ah, yes, for the love of Elena. How is it that she manages to overlook every horrific thing you've ever done? Is it willful ignorance or perhaps something more pathological?"
27786,Damon, Some people are just more capable of forgiveness than others. Bet you score about a negative 500 in that realm
27787,Klaus, Come on. There must be a secret. It can't just be the sire bond. What is it? Compulsion? Manipulation? What is it you say to her?
27788,Damon," I think this has something to do with a certain blond vampire. I think you m*rder Carol Lockwood, and I think you're worried that Caroline's never going to forgive you"
27789,Klaus, You've done worse
27790,Damon," Debatable. See, I don't mind being the bad guy, because somebody has to fill that role and get things done. You do bad things for no reason. You do them to be a dick"
27791,Klaus, Debatable
27792,Damon," If you're gonna be bad, be bad with purpose. Otherwise you're just not worth forgiving"
27793,Elena," Sorry, I have to take up the old people alcohol"
27794,Kol," Yeah, that's the problem with people today. They have no drinking imagination. Turn-of-the-century New Orleans… now, they knew how to make a drink"
27795,Elena, You lived in New Orleans?
27796,Kol," We all did, till Niklaus shoved a dagger in my heart"
27797,Elena, Why? What did you do?
27798,Kol, What makes you think I did anything? Has your alliance with my brother softened you to his horrors?
27799,Elena, I don't have an alliance with Klaus; we had a mutual interest in finding the cure. That's all
27800,Kol, Had?
27801,Elena, Yes. And I'm willing to give up looking for it if you promise to leave my brother alone. Now can you teach me how to make this? I'll get some ice
27802,Jeremy," Bonnie where are you, I've called, like, 17 times. Kol is in our house. We need you. Ok, I'm headed to your house now"
27803,Kol, Would you like one?
27804,Elena, Sure. Why not? You're really good at that game. Especially considering you've been locked up in a coffin for a hundred years
27805,Kol," I'm a quick learner. Speedy reflexes. It's not much like the real thing, though, is it? You have k*ll, haven't you? Or are you one of those Mary Sue vampires?"
27806,Elena, I k*ll...once. I'm guessing your number is a lot higher than mine
27807,Kol, You lose track over the years. So are we going to talk about Silas or just jibber jabber?
27808,Elena, No one else seems to think Silas exists. So why do you?
27809,Kol," I used to run with some witches in Africa in the 14th century, Haiti in the 17th century, New Orleans in the 1900s. They all knew about Silas and that he needed to stay buried. I actually hold witches in high esteem"
27810,Elena," Yeah, but why Silas? Why are you so afraid of him?"
27811,Kol," They said if Silas rises, he'll unleash hell on earth. I happen to like earth just the way it is"
27812,Elena, That's pretty Biblical
27813,Kol," Well, that's the other problem with people today. They've lost faith, and in that loss, they no longer know who they should fear"
27814,Bonnie, I have to get to Elena. Have you seen my phone?
27815,Rudy," I've got your phone, and I've got your car keys. And I told you we are having a family meeting"
27816,Bonnie, Is that something you read in a book? Because we have never had a family meeting
27817,Rudy, I've let this go on long enough. Shane said you and your magic are like a ticking time b*mb
27818,Bonnie, And I told you he's crazy
27819,Rudy, I lost your mother to witchcraft. I don't intend to lose you
27820,Bonnie, It's not your life. It's mine
27821,Jeremy," Hey, is Bonnie here?"
27822,Rudy, She's busy
27823,Jeremy, It's important
27824,Bonnie , What's going on?
27825,Jeremy," I've called you, like, a hundred times. Kol is in our house"
27826,Bonnie, I have to go
27827,Rudy, I said no
27828,Bonnie, Stop telling me what to do!
27829,April, No one's going anywhere!
27830,Bonnie, Mom?
27831,Rudy," Abby, please come in"
27832,Bonnie, What are you doing here?
27833,Abby, Your father called. Who's Professor Shane? What has he been teaching you?
27834,Jeremy," Bonnie, we don't have time for this"
27835,Rudy, This is a family matter
27836,Jeremy, My sister's in trouble. We need Bonnie's help
27837,April, My daughter is done helping Elena Gilbert. Now get out
27838,Bonnie, Mom!
27839,April, Answer my question. What lies has this professor been telling you?
27840,Bonnie," Don't! Jeremy! Hey, stop! Stop. Don't hurt her. She's my mom. Look at me. Just go, Okay? I'm right behind you"
27841,Bonnie, You wanna talk? Let's talk
27842,Elena, So we're out of gin but I think this is a good year
27843,Kol, What if I said I don't believe you?
27844,Elena," Ok, you got me. I don't know anything about wine"
27845,Kol, Just seems odd that you being so willing to give up something you want so much
27846,Elena," I would do anything for my brother. And if what you're saying about Silas is true, what does it matter what I want if it puts everyone else in danger?"
27847,Kol," Well, this has been an enlightening. Thanks for the drinks. I'll take your request for truce under advisement"
27848,Elena, Is there any chance that you can be wrong about Silas?
27849,Kol," Trust me, Elena. Some things are better left buried"
27850,Rebekah, Think I saw a horror movie that started just like this. Did you know they play movies on TV all night long now? Hundreds of them. So much better than those silly black-and-white picture shows we use to go to
27851,Stefan, I don't know. Kind of miss the old ones. I'll let you pick. Nothing cheesy
27852,Rebekah," Oh, that leaves out about half the decade"
27853,Stefan, Hope you like the cure
27854,Rebekah, Funny
27855,Rebekah, So is everything about the eighties so... excessive?
27856,Stefan," I think, it had its charm. ""Say anything""… Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window with a boom box over his head desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams. ""Princess Bride""… Wesley slays giant rats for love. ""Breakfast Club""…one detention turns a bunch of outcasts into allies"
27857,Rebekah," So it was a decade of sentimental drivel, as well"
27858,Stefan," Well, I was gonna say love, friendship, Possibility of anything happening. You would've loved it"
27859,Rebekah, And why is that?
27860,Stefan," Because, as much as we both hate to admit it, we care about those things"
27861,Rebekah, That better not be a corsage. I loathe corsages
27862,Stefan, These were all the rage in the eighties. Let's dance
27863,Elena," I'm sorry. He left. I mean, I tried to stall as long as I could"
27864,Jeremy, That's Bonnie. She was right behind me
27865,Kol, I've considered your request for truce. Request denied
27866,Kol, I'm sorry. I've already been invited in!
27867,Kol, Hide and seek? Fine by me
27868,Bonnie, Dad needs to mind his own business; he had no right to call you here
27869,Abby," It's not just your father, Bonnie. Witches talk. Word gets around"
27870,Bonnie," I found a new way to practice. It's unconventional, but I can handle myself, I promise"
27871,Rudy, That's not what Shane said
27872,Bonnie, Shane is sitting in a jail cell right now. You're gonna take his word over mine?
27873,Abby, I've warned you about dark magic before
27874,Bonnie," It's not dark magic. It's expression, and I need it. They found a cure, Mom. There's a cure for vampirism, and I can do the spell to access it. I can save you, but I have to go... now"
27875,Abby, I'm not the one that needs to be saved. You are
27876,Klaus, Your brother's lack of communication is infuriating
27877,Damon," It's one of his trademarks, like his brooding and his hair"
27878,Klaus," I don't understand what's taking so long. I mean, how hard is it to steal a dagger?"
27879,Damon," From the vampire who's been stabbed by it as many times as your sister, I'd say difficult"
27880,Klaus," You disappoint me, Damon. You're not trying very hard to get out of here. I expected more the daring escape artist, less the cell potato"
27881,Damon," Well, I am compelled to k*ll Jeremy, so I figured it's probably smarter to sit in there and chitchat with you than try to bust out of here like the Hulk"
27882,Klaus," How do you think Elena felt about that, by the way? Your inability to overcome Kol's compulsion for a single moment, even though it meant k*ll the person she loves the most in the world?"
27883,Damon, She met me. She knows impulse control is not my strong suit
27884,Klaus," Still, must be hard trying to live up to Stefan. I remember when I compelled him to feed on Elena, he fought so hard, he actually managed to resist. Now, that's love"
27885,Damon, What do you know about love?
27886,Klaus," I know that you're in love with Elena, but I think you're afraid of what might happen when we find the cure at the end of the rainbow. Personally, I don't see a fairy-tale ending for you? All I see is Stefan and Elena. I think you see the same thing"
27887,Klaus," Well, if it isn't the happy homicidal maniac"
27888,Kol, Do you know that your darling former bl*od bag and her brother are trying to k*ll me?
27889,Klaus, What?
27890,Kol, Don't pretend like you're not in on it. Your obsession to find the cure clearly trumps any sibling loyalty you
27891,Klaus, I don't know what you're talking about
27892,Kol, I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm and k*ll Elena just for sport. Then I'm coming for you
27893,Klaus, What the hell is going on?
27894,Damon, I don't know
27895,Klaus, What are Stefan and Elena planning?
27896,Damon," I don't know. I've been stuck in the penalty box with you since yesterday. Stefan won't talk to me, And Elena won't come to see me. So maybe you're right. Maybe she's written me off"
27897,Klaus, Tell me what you know
27898,Damon, I don't know anything about a plan
27899,Klaus, You stay here till I return
27900,Damon, I will stay here until you return... or not
27901,Stefan, It's amazing which you can find stashed away in the teachers' lounge
27902,Rebekah, This song is not as terrible as the other ones
27903,Stefan," This song is the Godfather of rock anthems, ok?"
27904,Rebekah, What's going on with you? You're... fun tonight
27905,Stefan," I can't listen to this music without thinking of my best friend Lexi. We spent most of the eighties together. I remember this one time she snuck us backstage and compelled half the band to do tequila shots with us before the show. She was fearless, kind of like you"
27906,Rebekah," So you slept with her, too?"
27907,Stefan, No. It wasn't like that. I was just a better person when I was with her. I didn't think I'd ever feel that way again
27908,Rebekah, Until Elena
27909,Stefan, Until Elena. And now that's over
27910,Rebekah," That look right there, that is why I don't let myself care"
27911,Stefan," Well, you can say that, but we both know it's not true"
27912,Rebekah, Don't worry. I'll protect you if Kol tracks his way to this abandoned dance. I think I'll choose next song
27913,Stefan, No. You know what? I've a better idea. That way
27914,Rebekah," Well, you coming?"
27915,Kol, You missed
27916,Elena, Go!
27917,Kol," Now, about that arm?"
27918,Stefan, Like that!
27919,Rebekah, This is ridiculous
27920,Stefan," Well, that's the whole point of the ""Breakfast Club"" slide. It's supposed to be ridiculous"
27921,Stefan, No. That's… That's cheating
27922,Rebekah, What is fun about hurtling down a hallway like a teenage imbecile?
27923,Stefan, You're just gonna have to do it to find out
27924,Stefan," All right. It's the shoes. Take off your shoes, you'll be fine, ok?"
27925,Rebekah," This is what you want right? Go ahead. Take it. You're right, I do care. I want stupid koala corsages and a prom. I want to have kids with someone who loves me enough to stand outside my window with a stupid boom box. I want to be human. So let Klaus put down my brother and let's go find the cure"
27926,Stefan," Come on, let's go"
27927,Rudy, You drogued her?
27928,Abby, Just enough to keep her down until I can get some witches here to clean her mind from that poison that professor has been teaching her
27929,Bonnie, That's not happening
27930,Abby, Bonnie please
27931,Bonnie, I don't belong to the spirits anymore. I belong to myself. Sorry
27932,Kol," Now, like I said, I don't fancy the hunter's curse. So I'm just gonna chop off your arm, but don't worry. I'll heal you right up with a bit of bl*od after. Sorry about the sting. Now, which arm is it? Is it left or right? I'll just chop off both to be safe"
27933,Elena," Jeremy, now!"
27934,Klaus, What did you do?
27935,Elena, We didn't have a choice. He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm
27936,Klaus, Lies. He never would've gotten inside if you hadn't have set a trap for him
27937,Elena," You said you were gonna put him down, too"
27938,Klaus," I was gonna make him suffer on my terms! I want to burn this house to the ground, and then when you try to flee for your lives, I'll k*ll you both without blinking"
27939,Jeremy," You k*ll us, you'll never get to the cure. You'll never be able to make any more hybrids"
27940,Klaus," You really think I care for an instant about my bloody hybrids? I want the cure so I can destroy it. I would've k*ll you all the second we dug it up, but now I'm just gonna watch you burn instead"
27941,Bonnie, Invite him in. Do it
27942,Jeremy, Come in
27943,Bonnie, Living room. Go
27944,Klaus," Witch, you can't do this to me"
27945,Bonnie, You have no idea what I can do now
27946,Klaus, I will hunt all of you to your end! Do you hear me?! Do you?!
27947,Rebekah, I don't believe you. Kol is not dead. He can't be
27948,Stefan," Listen, Rebekah. They didn't have a choice. Kol started this when he went after Jeremy. He went after you, too. Do you remember? I mean, he was never gonna let us find the cure"
27949,Rebekah," So you knew. This whole night, you knew"
27950,Stefan," I'm not gonna let the people that I care about get hurt. Not Jeremy, not Elena, not even Damon. And you can hate me for it. Now he can't hurt you, either. And I want us to find this cure together, you and me. Not just for Elena, but for you. So you can have what you want. You can be who you want. You can be human again. Everyone deserves a second chance right?"
27951,Rebekah, Why would I trust you?
27952,Stefan," I don't know. I guess I could give you my word, but at the end of the day you'll just have to take a leap"
27953,Jeremy, Didn't work
27954,Bonnie, It took time for Finn's line to die off. Remember? It'll work
27955,Jeremy, What if it doesn't?
27956,Damon, Where's that Gilbert optimism? Sorry I missed all the excitement
27957,Elena, I'm just happy to see you
27958,Damon, So I guess I didn't miss much
27959,Stefan, Got the Silas's headstone
27960,Elena, We're just waiting for Jeremy's mark to grow. Klaus is trapped in our living room
27961,Bonnie," Temporarily. I drew the new moon to bind the spell. Got three days to find that cure, four max"
27962,Jeremy," If we don't, we might as well look up Katherine Pierce and see if she wants some company in hiding 'cuz he will come after us"
27963,Elena," We'll find it. Now we've got Rebekah taken care of, all we need is Professor Shane, and we'll have everything we need"
27964,Stefan," Yeah, I didn't uh...I didn't dagger her"
27965,Elena, What? Why not?
27966,Stefan," I didn't need to, she's on our side"
27967,Elena, On our side? Did you just say that?
27968,Stefan, Yeah. She handed over the headstone; I mean she wants to find this cure more than anyone of us
27969,Elena, Why would you possibly think that you could trust her?
27970,Damon, Let me guess. She pledged her allegiance to you while you were naked in the sack
27971,Stefan," I bet you're just dying to get that out, weren't you Damon?"
27972,Damon, Oh was this supposed to be secret? Maybe you should make that a little clearer while you're bleeding me dry in our cellar
27973,Stefan, Yeah. To keep you from k*ll Jeremy
27974,Elena," Stop it, both of you"
27975,Stefan," Now why don't you tell her to calm down, Damon? You've managed to use that sire bond pretty well so far, haven't you?"
27976,Jeremy, It's happening
27977,Elena, Oh my god
27978,Jeremy, What? You can see it?
27979,Damon, Here we go
27980,Shane," Congratulations, we made it"
27981,Damon, They couldn't have hidden this cure in Hawaii? Where the hell did you take us?
27982,Shane," 200 miles off the Nova Scotia mainland. If you recall, the whole point was to hide the cure on the world's most obscure, desolate island"
27983,Damon," Oh, yeah? I thought the whole point was that no one found Silas, the oldest, deadliest freak in the world"
27984,Shane," Yeah, that too. Sunscreen?"
27985,Damon, Is that a joke?
27986,Shane, You're right
27987,Stefan, Not really helping
27988,Rebekah, You're perfectly capable of tying a knot
27989,Stefan, Your giving Elena the evil eye… it's not really helping
27990,Rebekah, She k*ll my brother and tried to get you to put a dagger in my back. She's lucky all she's getting is the evil eye
27991,Elena," You know I can hear you, right?"
27992,Rebekah," You know I don't care, right?"
27993,Rebekah, Go ahead. Try and k*ll me. But then you'd have to face your real problems… like the fact that Stefan invited me here himself. I guess he likes me again
27994,Damon, Looks like someone forgot her team-building exercises
27995,Elena, I'm not apologizing for not wanting her here
27996,Damon," You know, Stefan just brought her here to make it seem like he's moving on. He wants you to think that he's over you and he wants me to think that I can't get under her skin"
27997,Elena," You know, you're right. With any luck, I'll only have to tolerate her for a few more days and then we'll find the cure and I'll never have to deal with her again"
27998,Damon, Human Rebekah. Can't imagine her without fangs
27999,Elena, You know… you've never talked about what you'll do with the cure once we find it. Will you take it?
28000,Damon, I don't like to speculate
28001,Bonnie," Sorry. If there was a less awkward way to do this, I would"
28002,Jeremy, Doesn't bother me
28003,Bonnie," These symbols must have been left for the hunters so they could find the cure, and this must be the story of Qetsiyah and Silas. According to Shane, Silas asked Qetsiyah for help making a spell for immortality. She helped make him immortal, only to learn he planned to use the same spell on another woman, not her. When she found out, she freaked"
28004,Jeremy," So, Qetsiyah k*ll the other woman?"
28005,Bonnie," Yeah. Silas was immortal. She couldn't k*ll him. So, she trapped him in a cave and buried him alive instead"
28006,Jeremy, Does it say anything about the hunter's purpose in all this?
28007,Shane," I was wondering when you'd ask. Qetsiyah created a cure for immortality and then she buried it with Silas, hoping that he'd take it and die. End up on the other side with her for all eternity. But he wouldn't give her the satisfaction. So, many centuries later, her descendants created the hunters to find him, cure him, and k*ll him. You know what? I'll explain on the hike. Come on. We gotta get going"
28008,Tyler," Morning, Sunshine. You look pathetic"
28009,Klaus," Only until Bonnie's spell locking me in here wears off. Then I'll look different. Angrier, perhaps. Or, I won't look like anything, because I'll have gouged your eyeballs from their sockets"
28010,Tyler," My friends will be back with the cure by then. So, I could shove it down your throat and make you mortal"
28011,Klaus," I'm an original. What makes you think my entire vampire bloodline won't be cured along with me? I.E., you"
28012,Tyler," You know what I think? I think that's impossible. I think the moment you stop being a vampire, our whole bl*od connection to you is broken, and your sire-line ceases to exist. So, whatever happens to you happens only to you, which means I can k*ll your ass and no one else has to die. Although I am still debating just how to do it"
28013,Klaus," I recommend drowning. There's nothing quite like the feeling of someone fighting for something as basic as human breath. And let me tell you, your mother was a fighter"
28014,Shane, Satellite phone lost its signal
28015,Damon, That's a good sign
28016,Elena, Is anyone else a little creeped out?
28017,Rebekah," So, then leave. Out of everyone, your presence is the least necessary"
28018,Stefan, Please don't start
28019,Rebekah," I'm merely stating the facts. Jeremy has the spell on his body. Bonnie's the witch that unseals the cure. Shane is the human compass. You and I have the tombstone, which does God knows what. And Elena has no point"
28020,Damon, What about me?
28021,Rebekah, You have a nice behind
28022,Shane," Centuries after Qetsiyah died, there were these miners who were excavating a well on the island. Suddenly went mad. Bled themselves dry. No apparent reason. So, the legend spread that these miners, in exchange for a drop of their bl*od, saw visions of their lost loved ones in the well they were digging. The word traveled and explorers sought out the well to see if the legend was true"
28023,Bonnie," So, the well was magic?"
28024,Shane, Yeah. Some people believe the voices of lost souls were just a wind vortex whipping through caves. And visions were caused by inhaling the island's poisonous plant's life
28025,Elena, And what do you believe?
28026,Shane, I believe in magic. My wife and my son died within months of each other. And so...I decided to try the well out for myself. I offered up my bl*od and waited
28027,Shane, Hello? Hello?
28028,Voice, Atticus…?
28029,Shane, Caitlin. Caitlin? Caitlin?
28030,Woman," Hello, Atty"
28031,Shane, Caitlin
28032,Shane, I saw my wife. I saw her eyes. Her smile. My bl*od let me see her again
28033,Damon," Yeah, got it. Don't eat the poisonous flowers"
28034,Shane, Wait. Stop. Stop! Stop. Is everybody paying attention?
28035,Shane, Our first lesson in survival. Stay together. Keep your eyes open
28036,Jeremy, I out of water
28037,Elena, Here. Take mine
28038,Jeremy, Magic well? Seriously?
28039,Elena, I don't know. I mean... We've all lost someone. The chance to maybe see them again? I kinda get it
28040,Elena, Jeremy!
28041,Elena, What the hell just happened?
28042,Jeremy, Somebody just saved my life
28043,Stefan, What is this place?
28044,Shane," According to island lore, a group of college kids came here for spring break. A few weeks later, they were all found dead, completely drained of bl*od"
28045,Rebekah," Well, tragic for them, brilliant for us. Who sleeps where?"
28046,Damon," Well, that's lovely. There's a mystery man with a hatchet lurking in the woods and we're just gonna camp?"
28047,Shane, We're safer here than we are hiking in the dark
28048,Damon," Let's just keep going. You know? Get the cure. Get in, get out. Where is it?"
28049,Shane, How stupid do you think I am?
28050,Damon," Stupid enough to raise an immortal witch, so I'd say...incredibly"
28051,Shane," Yeah, I'm shocked you even want the cure, considering you've got the most to lose once Elena's human"
28052,Elena, Shane doesn't know what he's talking about
28053,Damon, We'll find out tomorrow
28054,Elena," Do you really think I'm gonna take this cure, break the sire bond, and fall out of love with you?"
28055,Damon," No. I'm saying we don't know. And if we find it tomorrow, we will"
28056,Elena," This cure is gonna change so many things. Jeremy's not gonna want to k*ll me anymore. We're finally gonna get rid of Klaus. Bonnie's mom isn't gonna be a vampire. And anyone who wants to take this cure is gonna have that option. Caroline, Stefan, and you. If you want it"
28057,Damon, I get it. Everything changes tomorrow. It'll be all unicorns and rainbows
28058,Elena," No, not everything. That's what I'm saying. Damon, not my feelings for you"
28059,Caroline, You're still here? What are you doing?
28060,Tyler, Gloating
28061,Klaus," Hello, Caroline"
28062,Caroline, Come home. Don't stoop to his level
28063,Tyler, He destroyed my life. I plan on being present for every second of his misery until I can k*ll him myself
28064,Caroline, Fine. You can gloat and multitask. This place is a disaster. Starting with a horrific burnt corpse
28065,Klaus, Tyler's mother is dead. So is my brother. We're even. Call Bonnie and get her to let me out of here
28066,Caroline," I will never, ever, help you"
28067,Klaus, How quickly you forget the part where I saved Tyler from the misery of being a werewolf. Or the night your mother invited me into her home to save the life of her precious daughter
28068,Caroline," How delusional are you? You k*ll his mother. And let's not forget that we're standing in a house where Elena's Aunt Jenna used to live. Or did you think that your charm would make us forget how you k*ll her, too? You know what? No. I am not going to engage in this. You are not even worth the calories I burn talking to you"
28069,Tyler, No! 
28070,Klaus," Now, that was definitely worth the calories"
28071,Rebekah," Well, 7 of us and no one thought to bring s'mores. What are you doing with that?"
28072,Stefan, We're a day away from finding the cure. Not letting it out of my sight
28073,Rebekah, Do you hear that? I swear this place is haunted
28074,Stefan, Um...you're crushing my arm
28075,Rebekah, Ok. You got me. I'm a scaredy cat
28076,Stefan," You do realize you're an original vampire, right?"
28077,Rebekah, Which is precisely why you should stop teasing me. I'm very powerful. What are you gonna do when Elena becomes human and comes running back to you? You said that you'd take the cure to be with her. You'd have children and grow old. Is it still true?
28078,Stefan, Why do you want to take it? Aren't you the perfect vampire?
28079,Rebekah," Isn't it obvious? It's all an act, Stefan. Being a vampire is miserable. I would give anything to be human. Normal"
28080,Stefan, If I take the cure... It wouldn't be for her. It'd be for me
28081,Bonnie, I've been staring at pictures of Jeremy's tattoo and there's no spell
28082,Shane, Expression doesn't require a written spell. Just think of it as a way of accessing magic that already exists inside you. You just have to want it bad enough
28083,Bonnie, And I'm just supposed to trust you?
28084,Shane," Bonnie, listen, I taught you expression so that you could access the cure. I'll be right there with you the whole time. Promise"
28085,Damon, You didn't answer the trust part
28086,Shane," All right. Let me put it this way. You need me to help you through it, Bonnie. And as you've demonstrated, expression can get messy. Believe me when I say I've seen it get a lot worse"
28087,Damon, How much worse?
28088,Shane," When we lost our son in the car accident, my wife kind of lost it. She tried to resurrect his body using magic"
28089,Bonnie, Your wife was a witch?
28090,Shane, She was a powerful witch and incredibly undisciplined
28091,Bonnie, And you never thought to tell me?
28092,Shane," I just didn't want to scare you. The truth is, she tried to bring our son back using expression, and it overwhelmed her, and she died"
28093,Bonnie, You taught me the same magic that k*ll your wife?
28094,Shane," I've learned the warning signs, all right? I can keep expression from consuming you"
28095,Damon," Downside is, you turned her into a b*mb that only you can dismantle"
28096,Shane," Don't you think I know how this ends? I came here to raise Silas so that he could bring back the dead, but you're never gonna let that happen. The second I point to a cure, you're gonna k*ll me. Now Bonnie has to keep me alive so that I can keep her alive"
28097,Caroline," Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God..."
28098,Tyler," Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. I can fix this"
28099,Caroline, How? The only thing that can heal me is his bl*od. Oh my god…
28100,Tyler, I know. I'll fix it
28101,Tyler, She'll die if you don't heal her
28102,Klaus, Okay. Beg me to save her life
28103,Tyler," Is this what you want? To remind me that I'm powerless against you? Fine. You win. I'm nothing. Now, save her. Please"
28104,Klaus," I'm sorry, mate. I didn't quite catch that"
28105,Tyler, Please. Please. Please save her life
28106,Klaus," See, now I think you're just telling me what I want to hear. I mean, you did call me pathetic earlier. And wouldn't it be more pathetic of me to help now, knowing that hours ago, you announced your plan to k*ll me in a manner in which you're still debating because you want it to have a certain amount of flair?"
28107,Tyler, I'm just asking. I'll be your slave again. I'll do whatever you want. Just help her
28108,Klaus, No
28109,Caroline, Get me out of here. I can't even look at him
28110,Tyler, Come on
28111,Elena, Jeremy! Did you find anything?
28112,Bonnie, He's not on the trail
28113,Shane, His gear's still here
28114,Stefan," He's not at the quarry, either"
28115,Damon, Split up
28116,Bonnie, I'm gonna stay and try a locator spell
28117,Shane, Ok. I'll stay here. I'll make sure she's safe
28118,Damon, I'll stay here and make sure you're not lying
28119,Elena, Fine. We'll keep searching the island
28120,Damon, Thought it didn't work
28121,Shane, Yeah. I'm just… just checking the signal
28122,Damon, So you can call someone? Like whoever took Jeremy?
28123,Shane," This place has a habit of getting to you, doesn't it? See for yourself"
28124,Damon, I'm done trusting you
28125,Damon, Where's the cure?
28126,Shane, You know that magical well I was telling you about? Silas and the cure are buried deep below it
28127,Damon," So, you've seen it?"
28128,Shane, No. But you could say I heard it from a reliable source
28129,Shane, Caitlin. How is this happening?
28130,Caitlin, You're bleeding
28131,Shane, What?
28132,Shane," Oh, my God. Oh, my God"
28133,Caitlin, No. It's good. It's ok. It's what's keeping me here
28134,Shane," If a single drop of bl*od can give you a vision, could you imagine what two liters could do?"
28135,Damon, What does your dead wife have to do with a cure?
28136,Shane," She got nothing to do with a cure, but she has everything to do with Silas"
28137,Shane, I'm so sorry I let things get out of control. I should've stopped you
28138,Caitlin," Sweetheart, it's ok. You wanted Sam back as much as I did. What if you had a second chance to bring us both back?"
28139,Shane," I can't, baby. I'm not a witch"
28140,Caitlin," We have a witch. His name is Silas. If you set him free, he'll help those who have helped him"
28141,Shane, Set him free from… from what?
28142,Caitlin," He's entombed in the caves below us, but it's impossible to get him out without a spell. You need to get the spell"
28143,Shane, And that's when she explained everything that I had to do. Complete the Hunter's mark to access the spell and empower a descendant of Qetsiyah to perform it
28144,Damon, Bonnie Bennett's related to this crazy-ass witch?
28145,Elena, Jeremy?! Jeremy?!
28146,Rebekah, Why don't you yell louder? Maybe we haven't drawn enough attention to ourselves already
28147,Elena," I'm sorry, and how are you helping?"
28148,Rebekah, I'm stronger than you and faster than you and I'm quite certain I can charm the islanders a lot easier than you
28149,Elena, Not disagreeing on the easy part
28150,Stefan," All right, we get it. You two hate each other. Can we just keep going, please?"
28151,Rebekah," I tried being her friend, but somehow, I ended up with a dagger in my back because I'm the evil one"
28152,Elena," Technically, you didn't achieve evil status until you k*ll me"
28153,Stefan, Nice catch
28154,Rebekah, Thank you
28155,Elena," No, actually, thank you. This thing would've k*ll me"
28156,Rebekah," I don't care what happens to you either way. But if you're gonna die, it might as well be epic"
28157,Elena," I'm gonna go back and check on Bonnie, see if she found anything. Be careful"
28158,Damon," You have the rock, hunter, Bennett witch. What about the dozens that died in sacrifice? Where do they fit in to all this?"
28159,Shane," As you can imagine, that was not an easy pill to swallow"
28160,Shane," Caitlin, it's me, the guy who refused to serve a meat course at our wedding. I can't--I can't orchestrate 3 massacres"
28161,Caitlin, You're merely leading these people so Silas can bring them back from the dead
28162,Shane, Why… why should they die just to be resurrected? It doesn't make sense
28163,Caitlin, The spell that brings me back requires a witch to channel an extreme amount of mystical energy. Energy that doesn't occur in nature
28164,Shane," Because it isn't natural. I'm sorry, Cate. I just… I can't do that to innocent people"
28165,Caitlin, Can you feel my touch?
28166,Shane, How is this possible?
28167,Caitlin," Because you believe it is possible. You believe that you can see me again. You don't have to take a single human life yourself, Atticus. All you have to do is convince someone to believe that it is possible that they can see a lost loved one again. And they'll do it for you"
28168,Damon, Which is how you manipulated the pastor to blow up a farmhouse full of people
28169,Shane, He just wanted to see his wife again
28170,Damon, We need 3 massacres. Fire at the young farm. Holiday hybrid slaughter. What mass blood-letting am I forgetting?
28171,Shane, You're not
28172,Damon, You're not finished. Is that why you brought us all out here in the middle of nowhere? m*ssacre number 3?
28173,Shane," It doesn't work that way, Damon"
28174,Damon, I think you need to tell me where this magical well is
28175,Shane, You know I can't do that
28176,Damon," Oh, I know"
28177,Caroline, It's getting worse. I'm sorry
28178,Tyler, No. It's my fault. I'm sorry
28179,Caroline, No. You didn't do any of this
28180,Tyler, I unsired the hybrids and turned them on Klaus. I should've just left it alone
28181,Caroline," You freed them, Tyler. People put their faith in you because you're a leader. Don't forget that"
28182,Tyler, Then you trust me?
28183,Tyler," You want to be in control, Klaus? Here. Now you get to be in control of her life. If you want her to die, fine. But then you can sit here and watch her die yourself"
28184,Klaus," Nothing personal, love. If I heal you that means victory for him. Don't worry. It won't be long now"
28185,Damon, Where's the cure?
28186,Shane," Does it matter? I think we both know you'd rather just torture me. Torture gives you a sense of control, especially with your relevance slipping away. I look at you. Here you are, hours from Elena breaking her sire bond. Start to freak out a little bit. Listen, you want my advice? Leave. Go. Don't put yourself through this"
28187,Shane," Oh! Fine. Ok. Let's say her feelings for you are real. How does that end? She's human. You're a vampire. It's doomed, Damon. See, you're not torturing me, man. You're torturing yourself by helping them find the cure"
28188,Damon, I could k*ll you. Then no one would find it
28189,Shane, We've established that you can't k*ll me without sending Bonnie off the deep end. You can leave the island. Have a modicum of self-respect. Don't stay here and watch Elena walk away from you
28190,Damon," Right. Because if I'm not here, then I can't get in between you and whatever you're planning with Silas. I'm not that easily manipulated, Professor. And there is one flaw in your logic. I don't give a crap about Bonnie Bennett"
28191,Elena, What is wrong with you?
28192,Elena, What did you say to him?
28193,Shane," Your boyfriend's a maniac, Elena"
28194,Elena, Stop messing with my friends
28195,Elena," Shane is the only thing that's keeping Bonnie safe, and you try to k*ll him? And you wonder why Bonnie hates you"
28196,Damon," I don't wonder, Elena, because I don't care. I don't care about her. I don't care about some lame-ass cure for vampires, either"
28197,Elena, How can you say that right now?
28198,Damon, Because I don't want you to be cured
28199,Elena, I'm not fighting with you about this anymore. Being human isn't gonna change my feelings for you
28200,Damon," Fine. Say they're real. Say you've become human and you still love me. Then what? You grow old. You die. I stay a vampire. Face reality, Elena. We don't work"
28201,Elena," So, things aren't easy and you're just gonna push me away now? That's what you do, Damon. You think that you don't… you don't deserve something, so you ruin it. I'm not gonna let you pull that this time. Take the cure with me. That's how much I know this is real. That's how certain I am that I'm going to love you even after this is all over. Take the cure. Be human with me. We can be together. Grow old together. This doesn't have to be hard anymore"
28202,Damon," That's not me, Elena. That's Stefan. I used to miss being human. Now I can't think of anything more miserable on earth"
28203,Stefan, Haven't we been through here before?
28204,Rebekah, It all looks the same to me
28205,Rebekah, Thanks. But that wouldn't have k*ll me
28206,Stefan, Sorry. Force of habit
28207,Rebekah, Don't be a tease. Elena could be lurking somewhere in the woods
28208,Stefan, Do you mean what you said? About a cease-fire?
28209,Rebekah, Why do you all assume that I hate Elena so much?
28210,Stefan," Well, I mean, you did run her off a bridge"
28211,Rebekah," You all seem to forget that Elena's death was the only way to save my family. I did the same thing that every one of you would've done to protect the people that you love. And before you cast me as the bad guy, maybe you should remember that Elena's helped to k*ll not one but two of my brothers. Maybe we're not as different as everyone's making us out to be. Jeremy's not here. I'm going back"
28212,Elena, Bonnie?
28213,Elena, Where is everyone?
28214,Stefan, What are you talking about?
28215,Elena, Bonnie is not here and Shane's stuff is all gone
28216,Rebekah, Oh my god
28217,Rebekah, The tombstone's gone
28218,Caroline," If you don't feed me your bl*od, I'll die"
28219,Klaus," Then you'll die, and Tyler will have learned his lesson the hard way"
28220,Caroline, How could you do this to him? To his mom? To me?
28221,Klaus, I'm a thousand years old. Call it boredom
28222,Caroline, I don't believe you
28223,Klaus," Fine. Then maybe it's because I'm pure evil, and I can't help myself"
28224,Caroline, No. It's because you were hurt. Which means that there is a part of you that is human
28225,Klaus, How could you possibly think that?
28226,Caroline, Because I've seen it. Because...I've caught myself wishing that I could forget all the horrible things that you've done
28227,Klaus, But you can't. Can you?
28228,Caroline, I know that you're in love with me and anybody capable of love is capable of being saved
28229,Klaus, You're hallucinating
28230,Caroline, I guess I'll never know
28231,Klaus, Caroline. Caroline
28232,Elena, What are you doing in my tent?
28233,Rebekah, Where's the tombstone? What have you done with it?
28234,Elena, What are you talking about?
28235,Rebekah, Like it's not bloody obvious? All you people ever do is betray me and here you go again
28236,Stefan, Let her go. She didn't take it
28237,Rebekah, Was any of this real? Was it just a ploy to distract me while Shane ran off with the tombstone?
28238,Stefan, You think I would do that? You think I would let some psychopath run off with the cure? Every single moment of my last 146 year has been ruled by the pain of being a vampire. And this cure ends that. It ends the guilt and it ends the suffering. And you really think I would jeopardize that?
28239,Rebekah, Fine. You didn't take it. But that doesn't mean I trust her
28240,Elena," I didn't take it, but here. Consider this a peace offering"
28241,Rebekah," Don't you get it, Elena? There is no peace. We're all screwed"
28242,Elena," Exactly, Rebekah. We're screwed. Bonnie's gone. Shane's got the tombstone. Jeremy's missing and who knows if Damon's coming back. So, us 3 right here, this is all we've got. So, we're either in this together... or it's over. For all of us"
28243,Shane, Jeremy. Was a bit of a scare yesterday. Thanks for fending off his attacker
28244,Kidnapper, His attacker?
28245,Shane, Jeremy was attacked by an islander. I assumed you were his hatchet-flinging guardian angel
28246,Kidnapper, That wasn't me
28247,Shane, Then I guess there's somebody else on this island who's desperate to keep our hunter alive
28248,Bonnie, How did I get here? What the hell's going on?
28249,Shane, I see your locator spell worked
28250,Bonnie, The path behind me…
28251,Shane," Magically disappeared? You can thank the talents of Massak. He's a witch. Should you try to escape, he'll ensure that you never find your way back. So, the gang's all here. Silas awaits"
28252,Damon, You got to be kidding me
28253,Damon, You're one of the five
28254,Vaughn, Something bothering you?
28255,Damon, Would you believe me if I said mosquitoes?
28256,Vaughn," Oh, aye, I would. How does it feel when a relentless eating machine is draining the bl*od from your veins?"
28257,Damon, Itchy
28258,Vaughn," Your friends from Mystic Falls think you're funny, Damon?"
28259,Damon, You obviously know who I am and where I'm from. Have you been spying on me?
28260,Vaughn," Aye. I have. You and Stefan, Elena, your witch Bonnie. Do you need her to cast the spell written on your pal Jeremy's hunter's mark...? A tattoo that looks exactly like this"
28261,Damon," You want to know something, just ask"
28262,Vaughn," I've been k*ll vampires my entire life. Still, this thing refused to reveal itself to me. That was, until 3 days ago, and it just magically completed for no apparent reason"
28263,Damon," Come on, man. Do I look like I know anything about tattoos? Look at my skin. It's flawless"
28264,Vaughn," Ah, you're not taking me seriously. I don't blame you. You don't know me. So let me introduce myself. My name is Galen Vaughn, and you'd better start talking"
28265,Caroline, Tell me you're not serious
28266,Elena," I wish I weren't. When we got back from looking for Jeremy, Shane and Bonnie were both gone, too. Shane needs Bonnie to cast a spell on Jeremy's tattoo in order to find the cure, and he managed to sneak them both out from under our noses"
28267,Caroline," Well, where's Damon in all this?"
28268,Elena," We had an argument. I thought he was just taking a walk, but then when we went to the beach, we saw signs of a struggle"
28269,Caroline, Meaning what?
28270,Elena, Meaning somebody probably jumped him and then grabbed him
28271,Caroline, Do you think Shane took him?
28272,Elena," No, I mean, he's not strong enough to take Damon on, even with the element of surprise. He must have someone or at least a few someones helping him"
28273,Caroline, I am so sorry. I wish I was there to help
28274,Elena," Well, maybe there's something you can do from home"
28275,Caroline, Anything. Tell me
28276,Elena," So Shane's looking for the cure. We think we can find him. We have pictures of Jeremy's tattoo, but we just can't translate the map"
28277,Caroline, Unless you get the hunter's sword from Klaus
28278,Elena, Exactly
28279,Rebekah, He'll never give up the sword
28280,Stefan," Yeah, but if anyone's gonna get him to give it up, it's Caroline"
28281,Rebekah," He will never give up the sword, not even for Caroline. He's terrified we'll use the cure against him to make him mortal, and even if he wasn't, he wouldn't want any of us to derive a moment's worth of happiness from being human"
28282,Stefan," Well, maybe he doesn't have to give it up. Klaus is stuck in Elena's house by Bonnie's spell. He can't go anywhere. There's only so many places you can hide a 3-foot piece of metal"
28283,Caroline, I'll find it. Don't worry. Just email me photos of Jeremy's tattoo. I'll find the sword and I'll call you back
28284,Elena," Thank you, Caroline. Bye"
28285,Klaus," Need my help with anything, love?"
28286,Caroline, Nope
28287,Massak, This is as far as I go
28288,Shane," We're on the brink of a monumental event in human history. We're gonna raise the most powerful immortal creature that ever was. Come on, our work's not done yet"
28289,Massak, Mine is. You said get the kid and the witch. I did. I want to get paid now
28290,Massak, I'll say a prayer for your souls
28291,Bonnie, That's what the tombstone was for? To pay off a mercenary?
28292,Shane," The core of that tombstone is made up of Qetsiyah's calcified bl*od. In some witch circles, that stone's more valuable than the hope diamond. So… So who wants to go down first?"
28293,Klaus," Well, if it isn't little orphan Lockwood. Come to show how laughably impotent you are against me?"
28294,Tyler, I'm just trying to help my friends find the cure. Found this in your attic
28295,Klaus, And you think finding the sword brings you closer to the cure?
28296,Tyler, You tell me. I was playing around with the handle on the ride over... And I found this
28297,Klaus, And what do you think this is?
28298,Caroline," It's called a cryptex. I've seen ""The Da Vinci Code."" You turn the different sides to the different symbols to get the translation on the other side. And, with the magic of the Internet, Elena sent over these"
28299,Caroline," So now all we have to do is cryptex away. If you happened to want to help, we wouldn't stop you"
28300,Klaus," Right. Well, might I suggest using the magic of the Internet to purchase an Aramaic-to-English dictionary from your nearest retailer?"
28301,Tyler, What's Aramaic?
28302,Caroline," It's a dead language. It hasn't been used since, like, biblical times"
28303,Klaus," Qetsiyah's native tongue, I'm guessing. You know, even if you had the best dictionary in the world, it could take days to translate... Perhaps weeks. ""In bas so-teen-too ara-ma-eet."""
28304,Tyler, What does that mean?
28305,Klaus," ""If only you spoke Aramaic."""
28306,Elena," And, once again, everyone's life is in danger looking for this cure because poor Elena can't deal with being a vampire"
28307,Stefan," No, everyone's here because they want to be. Not just for you, but for themselves, too"
28308,Elena," Stefan, why didn't you tell me that you wanted the cure for yourself?"
28309,Stefan," I mean, why wouldn't I want to take it? I've seen every side of vampirism there is. The power... The misery, the guilt. In the long run, even the good parts kind of suck, too"
28310,Elena," Yeah, I mean, I know why you would want to take it, but... All I'm saying is... Why didn't you tell me?"
28311,Stefan," 'Cause it had nothing to do with you. I mean, you know how much I wanted a human life with you, being human myself, being normal... that's something I've wanted since long before I met you"
28312,Elena," Well, I'm glad you told me now"
28313,Stefan," Yeah, what's a deeply buried personal secret between friends, right?"
28314,Elena, Between friends? I like that
28315,Damon, Mind telling me where we're going?
28316,Vaughn," At the wishing well lies an entrance to a crypt. In the crypt lies Silas. And with Silas lies the cure, which will allow me to k*ll Silas, bring the mission of the brotherhood of the 5 to an end. You're my leverage, Damon; I use you to get your witch friend to open the passage to Silas' crypt for me"
28317,Damon," Wait a minute. You're using me to get to Bonnie Bennett? Whoa, brother. Heh! You picked the wrong vampire"
28318,Vaughn, I guess we'll see about that
28319,Damon," Here's the deal, Shrek. My witch friend will open the passage for you. No leverage necessary. We don't care about Silas. All we want is the cure, so you cut us in on your share, we'll get out of your hair"
28320,Vaughn," You really don't understand, do you?"
28321,Caroline," Ok, this is it. We've translated all the symbols on the tattoo. ""Passage inside... Requires a young senator and a pretty flower."" Ok, none of this makes sense"
28322,Damon," No, I don't understand, so why don't you explain it?"
28323,Vaughn, Silas is immortal. I have to cram the cure down his throat in order to k*ll him
28324,Damon," Yeah, what does it have to do with me and my friends?"
28325,Klaus," ""Requires a powerful witch and a hunter in full bloom."""
28326,Tyler, What are you doing?
28327,Klaus, I don't need to tell you my reasons. Bring my sword over here
28328,Vaughn," I need to use the cure against Silas. Your friends, they can't exactly have it, now, can they?"
28329,Damon," So you use it on Silas, and we'll use it for whoever wants to use it"
28330,Klaus," ""Silas rests on the far side, the means of his destruction at hand."" Turn the cryptex to the right"
28331,Klaus, Stop. The top of the hilt reveals a key to a nautical map. Turn it to the left
28332,Klaus, Now turn the other piece
28333,Klaus, Wait. There's something else
28334,Damon, You don't want to share it with us?
28335,Vaughn," Even if I wanted to, I couldn't"
28336,Damon, And why can't you share it?
28337,Vaughn, So it is written
28338,Caroline," What does that mean? .Klaus, what does it mean?"
28339,Vaughn, There is only one dose
28340,Jeremy, You ok?
28341,Bonnie," Yeah, I just slipped"
28342,Jeremy, It's okay
28343,Bonnie, Thanks
28344,Shane," Hey, guys, I'm coming down"
28345,Jeremy," Hey, Bon. What do you think's gonna happen once you cast a spell on my tattoo and there's nothing in between Shane and Silas?"
28346,Bonnie, Do you trust me?
28347,Jeremy," Yeah, of course"
28348,Bonnie, Then trust me when I promise I won't let Shane raise Silas
28349,Jeremy," Just don't do anything stupid. If your expression gets out of hand, Shane is the only one that could help you keep it in control"
28350,Bonnie, Don't worry about me. I'm fine. But if Shane tries to lift a finger on his hand to hurt either one of us... I'll k*ll him myself
28351,Rebekah, Hello?
28352,Caroline," Hey, it's Caroline. We have the translation of the tattoo. We're emailing you pictures of the map and instructions right now"
28353,Rebekah, Got it. Thanks
28354,Klaus," Actually, it was me"
28355,Rebekah," Nik, you helped?"
28356,Klaus," You sound so surprised, little sister"
28357,Rebekah," Shouldn't I be? I mean, you don't want me to be human. You don't want any of us to be human. Why would you help us find the cure?"
28358,Klaus," Maybe I finally realized the longer I stand in the way of what you want, the longer you'll continue to hate me. Perhaps I want my sister to finally know happiness"
28359,Rebekah," Fool me once, shame on you; Fool me a hundred times..."
28360,Klaus," No more fooling. No more games. I hope you get to live, and die, as you wish"
28361,Rebekah, So do I
28362,Klaus," There is one more thing, Rebekah. There is only one dose of the cure. You need to find it fast and take it. It's the only way you'll..."
28363,Rebekah, Nik. Nik!
28364,Damon, You touch me again...
28365,Vaughn," And you'll what? Threaten me? Sorry if you're upset about the cure, Damon, but we've got road to cover"
28366,Damon," I don't care about the cure. In fact, I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to be a vampire. You know why? If I wasn't a vampire, then I wouldn't be able to do 9 of the things I'm gonna do to you when I'm free"
28367,Damon, Make that 10
28368,Vaughn, Right
28369,Damon," All right, I admit, ok? My friends want the cure, and I want them to have it, and I get very upset when I can't provide for my loved ones. But tell me something, Vaughn, if all you're worried about is Bonnie the teenage witch, then why'd you save Jeremy and Elena yesterday?"
28370,Vaughn, How did I do that?
28371,Damon, Big guy. White paint all over him. Stuck a hatchet in his spine
28372,Vaughn, I don't remember doing such a thing
28373,Damon," We're on a remote island. There's you, me, and a bunch of unpleasant locals. You expect me to believe that someone else took out that monster truck of a human being that went after Jeremy and Elena?"
28374,Vaughn," I'm telling you, it wasn't me"
28375,Damon, Was that you?
28376,Vaughn, No. You?
28377,Damon, No
28378,Vaughn, I reckon there really is someone else on this island
28379,Shane," It's just amazing, isn't it? Once we raise Silas, all of our sacrifices will have been worthwhile; we'll all have what we want"
28380,Bonnie, Or he'll k*ll us all
28381,Shane," Listen, you're gonna see I'm right. Just so you don't get any ideas, remember, anything happens to me, something a lot worse will happen to you"
28382,Jeremy, All right. Where's this stupid magic passage she needs to open?
28383,Shane," Just look for anything that looks out of place, all right? Anything not occurring in nature, like a drawing or an inscription or..."
28384,Shane, Geometrically perfect circle. This is it. This is the spot
28385,Elena, What did Caroline say?
28386,Rebekah, I don't know. We lost the signal. Come on. This way
28387,Rebekah," We need to get down and across. Advantage, vampires: All we have to do is jump"
28388,Elena," Wait, wait. Um... Maybe you should leave the map behind. In case you fall, you don't want anything to happen to the phone"
28389,Rebekah, Are we doing this again? I thought we were a team
28390,Stefan," Guys, we don't have time for this. Elena, you go first. We'll be right behind you"
28391,Rebekah, There's something you should know about the cure
28392,Shane," Now you're doing it. Just breathe, all right? Focus on what you can do. Don't be afraid of what you can't. You can do this"
28393,Jeremy," Remember, just like you taught me. You're in control"
28394,Shane, That's it. It's just like drawing breath. Now just pull the power into you
28395,Vaughn, Looks like your witch is casting her spell
28396,Stefan," So you're sure that Klaus is telling the truth, that there is only one dose of the cure? Well, I guess that's what happens when you're dumb enough to hold out hope"
28397,Rebekah," There's still hope for one of us, but even if I felt pity for you, if I wanted to ease your pain so I gave you the cure to take for yourself, you'd give it to Elena, wouldn't you?"
28398,Rebekah," That's what I thought. Well, I'm sorry that it couldn't work out the way we all wanted it to"
28399,Jeremy, Bonnie?! Bonnie?!
28400,Bonnie, I'm fine
28401,Bonnie, Look. It worked
28402,Jeremy, You did it
28403,Bonnie, We did it
28404,Shane," Hey, guys, c... I need a hand. My leg's broken"
28405,Bonnie," Best to stay off it, then"
28406,Shane," Bonnie. Wait, wait. Don't... Come on. Bonnie! Help me! Come on! Please! Help me!"
28407,Vaughn," Well, here we are"
28408,Damon, Looks like someone b*at us to the punch
28409,Vaughn," That's a shame, Damon. I have no use for you anymore. Have to k*ll ya"
28410,Damon," Ditto. You know, that pesky hunter's curse and all"
28411,Damon, All right. How do you want to do this?
28412,Vaughn, I'll make it quick and painless
28413,Damon, Wish I could make the same promise
28414,Damon," I'm gonna k*ll you. And then I'm gonna get to that damn cure, and I'm gonna give it to the girl that I love"
28415,Vaughn, Your attachment to your friends will be the end of you
28416,Damon, You don't know my friends...
28417,Damon, Or my enemies
28418,Elena," There's only one cure? I can't take it. I mean, not above everyone else who deserves it just as much as I do. It's over"
28419,Stefan, I'm sorry
28420,Elena, Don't be. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise
28421,Stefan, How so?
28422,Elena," Things changed the minute that I went off that bridge, Stefan. Even if I could be human again, I wouldn't be the person that I was so it's about time that I accept the person that I am now and figure out a way... To start living the rest of my life"
28423,Stefan, The rest of your life... Sired to Damon
28424,Elena," I guess we'll have to deal with that when I get home. Oh, my God... Home. Klaus. Bonnie's spell isn't gonna hold him"
28425,Stefan," And after what we did to Kol, if we don't ram that cure down his throat, he'll k*ll us all"
28426,Elena, Pity party over. We have to go
28427,Tyler," Every time I think I have him, that son of a bitch gets the upper hand"
28428,Caroline, We won't let him hurt you. Stefan and Elena will bring back the cure
28429,Tyler," If they get to it first. And if they don't, Klaus k*ll me. I need to get out of town to figure out how I'm gonna stay alive..."
28430,Caroline," Wait, hang on, ok? Gosh! Before you get all doomsday, just... at least let me try and talk to him"
28431,Tyler," He's got nothing to lose, Care. His brother's dead, his hybrids are gone. All he wants right now is bl*od, starting with mine"
28432,Caroline," I'm not gonna say good-bye to you again, do you understand me? Let me fix this"
28433,Damon, Are we gonna dance or are we gonna play?
28434,Rebekah," You know he can't hurt me, Damon, unless he's got the white oak stake"
28435,Vaughn," Oh, he doesn't, but he's got other toys"
28436,Stefan, Damon!
28437,Damon, You're wasting time. Just get the cure. Go
28438,Elena, We're not gonna leave you
28439,Stefan," No, we aren't. You need to go ahead. We'll be right behind you. Go!"
28440,Bonnie, Look at us. A newbie hunter and a witch who needs adult supervision
28441,Jeremy, How are we the ones that made it this far? I'm glad we're here together
28442,Bonnie," Me, too"
28443,Jeremy," Where is ""here,"" exactly?"
28444,Bonnie, This way
28445,Jeremy, How do you know?
28446,Bonnie, I just know
28447,Sheila," Hello, Bonnie"
28448,Bonnie," Hi, grams. What are you doing here, grams?"
28449,Sheila, This place allows the living to talk to the dead
28450,Jeremy," Bonnie, what's going on?"
28451,Bonnie, I am so sorry about what happened
28452,Sheila, It's ok. You're here now. And you are this close to bringing me back to life for good
28453,Bonnie, How?
28454,Sheila," Silas can do it. All you have to do is reach him and feed him, and everything will go back to the way it was"
28455,Jeremy," Bonnie, stop! Hey, you're not seeing your grams. If she were here, I'd be able to see her, and I can't. It's not her ghost. It's a hallucination. What you're seeing, it isn't real. It's me. Your grams isn't here. I'm here. I'm real, ok?"
28456,Bonnie, Jer… What happened?
28457,Jeremy, Silas. He was in your head. He was trying to control you
28458,Bonnie, And Shane. Illusions of his wife. That's how Silas controls him
28459,Jeremy, You need to block him out of your mind. Close your eyes. Listen to my voice and only my voice. I'm gonna get us there
28460,Caroline, You can't k*ll Tyler
28461,Klaus," Not only can I, I have to. I have a reputation to uphold. Moreover, I want to"
28462,Caroline," I'm not asking you to forgive him. All I'm asking is that you let him live, somewhere far from here"
28463,Klaus," So he gets to live a happy life after he turned all my hybrids against me, after he tried to k*ll me, after he made it his life's mission to find the cure so he could use it against me..."
28464,Caroline, We all want the cure
28465,Klaus, Do we? Do you?
28466,Caroline," It doesn't matter. There's only one, so it's not like I'm gonna get it anyway"
28467,Klaus," But if you could... You wouldn't, would you? You prefer who you are now to the girl you once were. You like being strong, ageless, fearless. We're the same, Caroline"
28468,Caroline," Then show me. You know how much I love Tyler. You can see how scared I am to lose him. If you and I are so similar, then show me your compassion. Show him the mercy that I would show you"
28469,Klaus, Mercy… for Tyler? Very well. Tell him to leave town immediately. And tell him to run and hide in a place I will never find him
28470,Caroline, Of course
28471,Klaus, Tell him that this is the mercy I extend for your sake... That I will give him a head start before I k*ll him
28472,Stefan," All right, come on. We have to catch up"
28473,Damon," No, it's ok. I just need a minute. I'm only gonna slow you down. Go. She only needs one of us"
28474,Stefan, And what? You don't care to be that one anymore? You finally decided it was easier to just walk away?
28475,Damon," There's only one dose of the cure, Stefan. If she wants to take it, you want her to. I don't. Just do what makes her happy, Stefan"
28476,Stefan, Things have changed. It's not that easy anymore
28477,Damon, It is right now. Get your ass down the well. Help Elena get the damn thing. Come on
28478,Elena, Stefan? Hello
28479,Voice, Elena… 
28480,Elena, No
28481,Caroline, How many times are we gonna have to say good-bye?
28482,Tyler, At least this time we have a minute to do it the right way
28483,Caroline, There isn't a right way
28484,Tyler," This isn't good-bye. This is... Until we find a way. We're immortal, remember? We will find a way"
28485,Caroline," What if we don't? Tell me that you'll never think of me again. Tell me that you'll forget about me, tell me that you are gonna go on and live a full and happy life without me"
28486,Tyler," I will live a happy life without you. I will forget all about you. And I will never, ever... Think about you again"
28487,Caroline, Until we find a way
28488,Shane," Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to share a little of that vampire bl*od"
28489,Stefan, Where are Jeremy and Bonnie?
28490,Shane, I have no idea
28491,Stefan, Stop lying
28492,Shane," I'm not lying… But if you help me, I will take you the rest of the way, I promise"
28493,Stefan, Did you know this whole time that there was only one cure?
28494,Shane," What? No. How could I? I've never seen it. Look, everything I ever said and did was just to bring back my family, I swear"
28495,Stefan," Well, then you know what it's like to have hope, and now you know what it feels like to lose it"
28496,Shane, Come on. Come on!
28497,Shane," Caitlin. I'm sorry, Caitlin. I failed you"
28498,Caitlin, No. you didn't
28499,Shane, I'm sorry. I tried
28500,Caitlin, You did everything I asked you to. Everything is going to be just fine
28501,Jeremy, Is this it? This is the cure? How is that supposed to cure every vampire in the world?
28502,Bonnie," I don't think it is, Jer"
28503,Jeremy, It's stuck. Help me move it
28504,Bonnie," It's, like, fossilized in place. It's like trying to bend stone. Oh my god…"
28505,Jeremy, What? What Bonnie?
28506,Bonnie," He's been frozen like a vampire statue for 2,000 years. There's only one way we're gonna get this statue to unfreeze"
28507,Jeremy, How's that?
28508,Bonnie," We have to feed him our bl*od. If we want to get the cure out of his hands, we... We have to wake him up"
28509,Rebekah, You're alive
28510,Damon, Yeah
28511,Rebekah, Why didn't you go with them?
28512,Damon, I needed a siesta
28513,Rebekah," You gave up, didn't you?"
28514,Damon, I didn't give up. I just realized... You can't control everything... No matter how hard you try. Let's just say I made peace with that fact
28515,Rebekah," Peace? You love Elena. You always will. If she becomes human, she may not feel the same way about you. You'll never know peace"
28516,Damon, Life sucks. Get a helmet
28517,Rebekah," You did something selfless, Damon. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were becoming a halfway decent person"
28518,Jeremy, Come on!
28519,Bonnie, There's got to be a way to do this without raising him. We'll find a way…
28520,Vaughn," Don't listen to the witch, boy. We have to raise Silas, and we have to do it now"
28521,Jeremy, Bonnie! What are you doing?
28522,Vaughn," What you should have done already. I'm gonna raise Silas... Then I'm gonna k*ll him. You're a bit confused, Mr. Gilbert. We're on the same team here"
28523,Jeremy, You stabbed my friend!
28524,Vaughn, I don't mess around with witches
28525,Jeremy, You can't use the cure on Silas
28526,Vaughn," It's what it's meant for! What else would you use it for? Your friends…. Your sister… Sorry, lad. It wasn't meant for that. Nothing personal"
28527,Jeremy, Don't! The hunter's curse!
28528,Elena, You okay?
28529,Caroline, How did you get out?
28530,Klaus," I fear something awful has befallen your friend Bonnie. Don't worry, love. You know I'd never hurt you"
28531,Caroline, You've done enough
28532,Klaus," I've done more than enough. I've shown kindness, forgiveness, pity... Because of you, Caroline. It was all for you"
28533,Stefan, Elena. What happened?
28534,Elena, She's here
28535,Stefan, Who?
28536,Jeremy," Elena's here now, ok? Everything's gonna be all right"
28537,Bonnie, We did it
28538,Katherine, Come on. We got to get you up
28539,Jeremy, You have to help Bonnie. The hunter stabbed her. You have to feed her
28540,Katherine, Ok. I just need to make sure that you're ok first
28541,Jeremy, I'm fine. What are you doing?
28542,Katherine," The cure. Jeremy, after everything we've been through, it's right there"
28543,Jeremy, It'll be there after we help Bonnie
28544,Katherine," God, I forgot what a brat you were"
28545,Jeremy, What?
28546,Katherine, I'm done playing nice
28547,Jeremy, Katherine
28548,Katherine," It's been too long, little Gilbert. Sorry. Family reunion is gonna have to be cut short"
28549,Elena," Jeremy! Oh, no. No. No. Oh, no. Oh, God, no. Oh, God... It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. You're gonna be ok. The ring will bring you back. It's ok. It's ok. You're gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok, Jeremy. You're gonna be fine"
28550,Damon, How'd this happen?
28551,Stefan, It was Katherine. She must have been following us this whole time
28552,Damon, What about the cure or Silas?
28553,Stefan," If there was anything in there at all, it's all gone"
28554,Damon, Where the hell is Bonnie?
28555,Stefan," I have no idea. She went looking for Jeremy last night. She never came back. Damon, Elena is in there waiting for the Gilbert ring to bring Jeremy back to life"
28556,Damon, Ok. Fine. We'll wait with her
28557,Stefan," Damon, listen to me. Jeremy was one of the five, a hunter"
28558,Damon, He's supernatural. The ring won't work anymore. She won't survive this. I'll find Bonnie. You get Elena off this island
28559,Caroline," Hey, you're home. I was trying to clean the burn mark where Kol... I couldn't get the spot out"
28560,Elena, Come on. Let's get him upstairs
28561,Stefan, Can I get you anything?
28562,Elena," No. I'm fine. I'm just gonna sit here and wait with him until he wakes up. Let me know if you hear anything about Bonnie, ok?"
28563,Stefan, Yeah. Sure
28564,Damon," Unless you're a blond, a Bennett witch, or a doppelganger, I suggest you steer clear"
28565,Rebekah," Where is it, the cure? I know someone has it"
28566,Damon," Yes, someone... Katherine"
28567,Rebekah, Katherine? The doppelganger?
28568,Damon," Yeah. Sneaky, little bitch must've been spying on us for weeks. She k*ll Jeremy... He k*ll your brother. Let's not with the fake sad face"
28569,Rebekah," I didn't say I was going to miss him, but I'm not heartless. He was Elena's only family"
28570,Damon," Good. Well, you can send flowers after you help me find Bonnie"
28571,Rebekah, We need to find Katherine
28572,Damon," If there's one thing that's a guarantee in this miserable, little world, it's that Katherine Pierce is gone. We need to find Bonnie. Oh, and beware of the immortal Silas. If he was asleep in that cave, he's awake now"
28573,Shane," Don't touch it. I used some of the island's herbs and berries to help treat the wound, but not being an actual witch, I can't guarantee much"
28574,Bonnie, How are you healed?
28575,Silas," It was Silas. He helped me. You did it, Bonnie. He's risen"
28576,Bonnie, Get away from me
28577,Silas," I know you're angry with me, ok, but now you'll see, everything I did, all those lives lost, they weren't in vain. Silas is gonna bring them back"
28578,Bonnie," What you want to do isn't natural, Shane. You can't bring back the dead"
28579,Shane, I think you'll change your mind now
28580,Bonnie," What do you mean, now?"
28581,Shane," When Silas awoke, he had to feed to gain his strength. He'd been desiccating for almost 2,000 years. He needed bl*od. Jeremy was there"
28582,Bonnie, What are you saying?
28583,Shane, He had…
28584,Bonnie, What are you saying to me?
28585,Shane," He drained him of his bl*od, Bonnie. Jeremy is dead"
28586,Caroline, How long has she been like that?
28587,Stefan, Ever since we found his body. She hasn't said anything except that she's waiting for him to wake up
28588,Caroline," But he's not going to wake up. She knows that, right?"
28589,Stefan," Look. Deep down, I think she has to, but we're talking about Elena here. She feels grief more powerfully than anyone else. I think her denial is the one thing protecting her from letting it all in"
28590,Caroline, She can't stay like that forever
28591,Stefan," I know, but I don't want to be the one to break her out of it, not until we know that Bonnie is safe, not until we get Damon over here to, you know... "
28592,Caroline, Use the sire bond to convince her that everything is ok?
28593,Elena," I'm not in denial. I know that he was supernatural, but did you see? His tattoo is gone. The tattoo had the spell that opened Silas' chamber. Maybe it being gone means that he fulfilled his supernatural destiny. Maybe he's back to normal. It's possible, right?"
28594,Caroline, Elena…
28595,Elena," It's possible, Caroline. There's a chance. It may be miniscule, but it's hope, and I'm gonna hold on to that hope with everything that I've got because there's no way... There's absolutely no way that my brother is dead. I'm not in denial"
28596,Caroline," Hey. I know that I'm not supposed to be calling, but something happened, and I need to talk to you, Tyler. So please call me"
28597,Stefan, Do you know where he is?
28598,Caroline, As far away from Klaus as he can get. Klaus said he wouldn't stop until he found him
28599,Stefan," Well, Katherine has been running from Klaus for 500 years. It's not easy, but it's possible. It's probably why she stole the cure. She wants to bargain for her freedom"
28600,Caroline," I just can't believe after all that, the cure is just gone"
28601,Stefan," Yeah. I mean, talk about denial. In my head, I was thinking there was no way Elena was gonna stay a vampire forever... And now without any family"
28602,Caroline," Well, we can't think about that right now. We need to make plans, lists. We need a funeral or a cover story or a funeral and a cover story. I should go tell my mom. I guess she'll know what to do"
28603,Stefan, We should get Matt over here
28604,Caroline," You're right. I will do that. I will call Matt, and then I will go tell my mom, and then I will make a list or a casserole or... I don't know... Whatever people are supposed to do or make in these situations. What's that smell?"
28605,Stefan, It's his body. He's starting to decompose. Tell you mom to get Dr. Fell over here
28606,Rebekah, Do you think Bonnie is dead?
28607,Damon," Never thought I'd say this, but I hope not"
28608,Rebekah, I don't like being out in the open like this
28609,Damon," What, afraid of the big, bad Silas?"
28610,Rebekah, No
28611,Damon, Scaredy cat
28612,Rebekah," I'm not a scaredy cat. My brother Kol drove himself mad worrying about Silas rising. It would benefit us all to be a bit concerned, and you're one to talk about being afraid. You're so scared; you're 1,200 miles away from where you're supposed to be"
28613,Damon," Hey, somebody needed to find Bonnie"
28614,Rebekah," Stefan could've done that. Aren't you Elena's current love? It's so hard to keep track these days. Shouldn't you be home comforting her, or are you terrified of being there when she realizes her brother is dead?"
28615,Rebekah, Ow!
28616,Damon, Sorry. Better you than me
28617,Damon," Mm, just the guy I wanted to see"
28618,Shane," Bonnie, here. Drink this. It'll calm you down"
28619,Bonnie," I don't want any of your stupid teas, Shane"
28620,Shane, Bonnie…
28621,Bonnie, Jeremy is dead
28622,Shane," Bonnie, be careful. Don't let your magic get out of control. Bonnie! Come on. Bonnie, I am not gonna let you fall apart. I'm not gonna let you. Silas needs you. He can bring Jeremy back. He can bring everyone back, and you're gonna help him, ok? You're gonna see Jeremy again"
28623,Meredith, Elena?
28624,Elena, Meredith? What are you doing here?
28625,Meredith, I came to check on your brother. May I?
28626,Elena," Yeah. Um... You're not gonna find any vitals. It's the same thing that Ric used to go through. He'd just be dead until then he wasn't. Once, I remember he was gone for almost an entire day. Ric died, like, 4 times before he lost his mind, and Jeremy has died a few times, too... 3, I think... so we're gonna have to... So we'll have to keep an eye on him because I don't want him to go crazy just like Ric did"
28627,Meredith," Elena… It looks like Jeremy died of extreme bl*od loss. His neck also appears to be broken. The lack of bl*od explains why there's no lividity, but his muscles have tightened past the point of rigor mortis. No. If he's left unattended to, soon he'll start to bloat. Within a few hours, his skin will discolor, and..."
28628,Elena," No, stop okay? Just stop. He's not dead"
28629,Meredith, I need you to release the body to me. We'll get him to a funeral home and prepare him for a viewing where you and his friends can say good-bye to him
28630,Elena," He's not dead, ok?"
28631,Stefan," Elena, stop it"
28632,Elena," Now you're all about science? Where was your science when you used vampire bl*od to save my life, huh? There is no science here. It's just magic. We need magic. We have to find Bonnie. Bonnie can fix this. Somebody just get me Bonnie!"
28633,Matt, Elena…
28634,Elena," No, no. No, Matt. It's fine. It's ok. It's ok. Bonnie will be here soon, and she'll fix everything, and it'll be all fine. Everything is gonna be fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fine"
28635,Elena," You're not dosing me again, are you?"
28636,Matt," Poison your best friend once, and suspicion follows you forever. Where are Bonnie and Damon?"
28637,Elena, We lost Bonnie on the island. Damon stayed back to try and find her
28638,Matt, That's funny. Doesn't he hate her?
28639,Elena, He doesn't hate her. I think he actually kind of loves her. You're mean to the people that you care about
28640,Matt, That's some messed-up logic
28641,Elena, Damon logic
28642,Matt, Damon logic. Listen. I want you to go somewhere with me
28643,Elena, I can't leave Jeremy
28644,Matt," Elena… There's nothing you can do right now, ok? Stefan can stay here with him. Come with me. Please"
28645,Damon," Here's the thing. I was completely willing to accept the fact that you were one man on a lonely mission to k*ll ol' Silas, and then I got boned by my Vixen Nemesis miss Katherine Pierce, and then I start thinking there's no way that this is a coincidence. So what do you know, huh?"
28646,Damon, Took you long enough
28647,Rebekah, Sorry. I had to dig the arrow out of my spine. Thank you for that
28648,Damon," Well, if you want a lead on Katherine Pierce, here's your guy"
28649,Vaughn, Torture me all you want. You can't k*ll me. The hunter's curse will torment you forever
28650,Damon, It'll be worth it
28651,Rebekah," He's right. You can't k*ll him, but that doesn't mean we can't tear him apart piece by piece, nerve by nerve until the pain is so severe, that your brain shuts it off to give you one tiny moment of blessed relief, and then we'll heal you and do it again and again and again"
28652,Damon, You are creepy
28653,Rebekah, Thank you
28654,Vaughn," I was tracking dens of vampires across Colorado. Katherine found me, said she could help me find Silas. She already knew about the hunter's mark, the cure"
28655,Damon, How?
28656,Vaughn," Oh, she had someone on the inside, some werewolf girl, friends with your Professor"
28657,Damon," Hayley, Tyler Lockwood's old friend. Ah, I knew she was shady. Where'd Katherine find her?"
28658,Vaughn, New Orleans. That's all I know
28659,Damon," Ah. Good. Let's throw him in a well. If he starves to death, it's not our fault. I'm gonna go find Bonnie"
28660,Rebekah," We've got a lead on the cure, Damon. I'm gonna find I but it suppose you don't mind. You never wanted Elena to be human again, anyway"
28661,Damon," I wanted that cure for her because it's what she wanted. You might think I'm afraid to go back, but I'm not because I know what she needs. She needs me to bring her best friend home"
28662,Shane, We got to get you home if you're gonna help Silas raise the dead
28663,Bonnie, I don't understand what I can do
28664,Shane," Well, Silas can't do magic. He was a witch, but after he became immortal, that ended. He can be a witch or a vampire, but never both. That's why I've been teaching you expressions, so you can do his work for him"
28665,Bonnie, What? How?
28666,Shane," Using the power of 3 massacres. Each m*ssacre of 12 marks the earth with power, and you can use expression to tap into that power"
28667,Bonnie, 3? You've had 36 people k*ll?
28668,Shane," No. I've had 24 people k*ll... 12 humans at the Young farm, 12 hybrids. You and I are gonna complete the triangle"
28669,Bonnie, We're what?
28670,Shane," Look. There needs to be another m*ssacre, but it's ok. They're gonna come back. It's worth it"
28671,Bonnie," I'm not helping you k*ll 12 people, Shane"
28672,Shane," Won't you if it meant you can see Jeremy again, your grams, everybody you and your friends ever lost? I think you would"
28673,Bonnie, No
28674,Jeremy, Bonnie
28675,Bonnie, Jeremy?
28676,Jeremy, It hurts
28677,Bonnie, Jeremy
28678,Jeremy, Help me
28679,Bonnie, I can help you. I'll help you. I can help you
28680,Shane," He asked you to help him, didn't he? He needs your help. You can do this, Bonnie. You know you can"
28681,Bonnie, I'll do whatever it takes
28682,Meredith, I'm bumping the AC. We're not gonna be able to leave him in there for much longer
28683,Stefan," Yeah. I know. I've been alive for almost two centuries now. You'd think with the amount of people that I've seen die, it would hurt less each time. Never does"
28684,Meredith," No. No. It never does. I see this every day. Sometimes I think that denial is the worst part for people like us because we know the truth. We can see they're on a collision course with it, and all we can do is brace ourselves for impact"
28685,Stefan, Did you find her?
28686,Damon, I'm still looking. How is she?
28687,Stefan," She's losing it, Damon. We can do what we can to delay things here, but we got to get Jeremy to the morgue before it gets ugly"
28688,Damon, Damn it. I can't just leave her behind. I can't show up without Bonnie
28689,Stefan," I think you have to. At this point, the sire bond is probably the only thing that's gonna keep Elena together. I can go back to find Bonnie"
28690,Damon, I'm on my way
28691,Damon, I could actually hug you right now
28692,Damon, Where have you been? How'd you find me?
28693,Bonnie," Shane led the way. He told me what to do, Damon. I know how to bring Jeremy back"
28694,Elena, You brought me to the stoner pit?
28695,Matt, I want you to see something
28696,Elena, Vicki
28697,Matt, Remember when Jer was so into my sister?
28698,Elena, When our parents died. It was his rebel phase
28699,Matt, I found this after Vick died. It made me smile... And this
28700,Elena, Jeremy and Vicky. Did he do that?
28701,Matt," After they found Vick's body, I remember thinking that things didn't feel over, you know, that there was no possible way that she could be gone forever. Then she wasn't. My point is, this town, this crazy-ass world we live in, sometimes not being willing to accept that someone is gone is because maybe they're not... At least not completely"
28702,Elena, Is that really what you believe?
28703,Matt, Yes
28704,Elena," If I compelled you to tell me the truth, is that what you would say?"
28705,Matt, I would tell you that it's ok to have hope... Because sometimes that's all that keeps me going
28706,Elena," Thanks, Matt"
28707,Elena, Stefan?
28708,Stefan, Hey. Damon found Bonnie. The plane is there waiting for them when they get off the island. They'll be home in a few hours
28709,Elena, Thank God. Is she ok?
28710,Stefan," Yeah. He said she's fine. Listen, Elena. You might have been right. There might be something"
28711,Elena," She knows what to do, doesn't she?"
28712,Stefan," Let's just see what she says when she gets home, ok?"
28713,Elena, Ok. We'll be home soon
28714,Vaughn," You know, if you're smart, you'll use the cure to k*ll Silas"
28715,Rebekah," k*ll Silas is your supernatural destiny, not mine"
28716,Vaughn," All right. Ok. Well, you be careful up there, you know, because he's up there running about"
28717,Rebekah, You sure about that?
28718,Vaughn, You don't believe me? Check my pack
28719,Vaughn," I found it in the chamber where he lay. They say no one has seen him. No one knows his face. How do you hide from the devil when you don't know what he looks like? Who knows? Maybe I'm him. Mark my words, if you don't use the cure to k*ll him, doesn't matter if you're human or vampire. You're doomed. We all are"
28720,Vaughn," Good luck to you, Lass. You've all brought this upon yourselves. May you rot in it! Ha ha ha!"
28721,Caroline," Tyler, it's me again. So I was thinking about it, and you probably ditched your phone, which is the smartest thing that you could do. So I don't know when you're gonna get this, but things were looking kind of bleak for a minute, and... I don't know... Maybe they're turning around So when you get this, call me back, and I'll tell you everything"
28722,Caroline," Thank God. We were so, so worried"
28723,Bonnie, I'm ok
28724,Damon, Could you get Stefan out here?
28725,Caroline, They said that she knows what to do
28726,Damon," Caroline, I need to talk to my brother"
28727,Caroline, What's wrong?
28728,Bonnie," I'll do whatever it takes. Whatever you ask of me, I'll do"
28729,Shane, Then you will see him again .There's just a few things we have to do first
28730,Bonnie, It's called an expression triangle. I need to complete it for Silas
28731,Matt, What?
28732,Damon," She's out of her mind, Stefan. The nutty Professor has got her totally brainwashed"
28733,Matt," Bonnie, you can't k*ll 12 people"
28734,Bonnie," I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only way to get enough power"
28735,Caroline, To do what?!
28736,Shane," When Silas was buried by the witch Qetsiyah, she left him with the cure and two choices... Stay mortal and rot or take the cure and eventually die in there of old age"
28737,Bonnie," At some point, wouldn't death by old age have been better?"
28738,Shane," No, because, you see, Qetsiyah had already one-upped him. She knew that he wanted to die so that he could find peace, be reunited with his one true love. So she created the other side as a purgatory for all supernatural beings, ensuring that if he died, he'd end up there forever. That's where you come in"
28739,Bonnie, Why me?
28740,Shane," Because you, as Qetsiyah's descendant can make the other side go away"
28741,Bonnie, How?
28742,Damon," I mean, the whole flight back home, all she could talk about was how she's the one that can drop the veil between this side and the other side"
28743,Stefan, Drop the veil? What does that even mean?
28744,Damon," What it means is, the myth about Silas being able to raise the dead is not just one or some. It's every supernatural being over there"
28745,Bonnie," Once the veil is dropped, the other side doesn't exist anymore. There's nothing separating us. We're all just one"
28746,Damon," 3 massacres, 3 hot spots, and the witch spell of the century, every supernatural being over there is back with a vengeance"
28747,Bonnie, I can't do that
28748,Shane," What? Oh, no. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. All the witches, your ancestors, who've been persecuted throughout time, your grams, Jeremy, they'll all be back. You can do this. You will do this"
28749,Caroline," Bonnie, you are talking like a crazy person. You are not k*ll 12 people, and you sure as hell can't invite every monster who has ever died back into this world"
28750,Matt," Caroline, I think she knows that"
28751,Bonnie," I can bring everyone back... Jeremy, Alaric, Vicki"
28752,Caroline," Bonnie, stop it. You can't just say these things"
28753,Elena, I'll get it
28754,Matt," Hey, look. I'll get it"
28755,Elena, I said I'll get it
28756,Elena, Hello?
28757,April," Elena, hey. It's April... Young. I was looking for Jeremy, and his cell phone keeps going straight to voicemail"
28758,Elena, Jeremy can't come to the phone right now. He's not... I'm sorry. He's dead
28759,Elena," He's dead. He's dead. Damon, he's dead, and he's been dead this entire time, and I... Oh, my God. I can smell him. How long has he smelled like that?"
28760,Damon," Hey, talk to me. I can help you"
28761,Elena, How? How are you gonna help me? How? Ok. Ok. We have to take care of his body. Bring him downstairs
28762,Damon, We shouldn't...
28763,Elena," Just carry him down, please"
28764,Elena, Where's Bonnie?
28765,Stefan, We told Matt to take her home. We thought it'd be best
28766,Elena, Ok. Guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way
28767,Caroline, Do what?
28768,Elena, Put his body on the couch
28769,Caroline," Elena? Elena, you need help finding something?"
28770,Elena, Got it
28771,Stefan, What are you doing?
28772,Elena," We need a cover story, right? You think I didn't hear you guys talking earlier? Well, what are we gonna say... Animal attack, tumble down the stairs? No. We burn the house down with him inside of it"
28773,Stefan," Elena, stop it"
28774,Elena," Why, because you want me to not be in denial? You want me to face the truth? This is the truth, Stefan. I don't want to live here anymore. I don't want these sketches. I don't want this Xbox. Not gonna need this bourbon anymore. Alaric is not here to drink it, I mean, unless you guys are willing to bring back every supernatural creature on the other side to get him hick. Would you? I know you want your drinking buddy back. Would you, Damon? Because I wouldn't. I don't know. I mean, does that make me a bad person? I have no idea"
28775,Elena, He's not gonna need that anymore
28776,Caroline," Elena, stop it. You're scaring me"
28777,Elena," What else are we supposed to do with the body, Caroline? I mean, there's no room in the Gilbert family plot. Jenna and John took the last spots"
28778,Stefan," No, no, Elena. Stop"
28779,Elena," There's nothing here for me anymore, Stefan. Every inch of this house is filled with memories of the people that I love that have died... My mom, my dad, Jeremy, and Jenna and Alaric, John, even John. I mean, they're all dead. Everyone is dead. So what am I supposed to... I mean, how am I gonna... I can't even... There's nothing left for me. Aah!"
28780,Damon," Elena, I need you to calm down"
28781,Elena," No, no, no. I can't. I can't. I can't. I... I can't. I can't. No. It hurts. It hurts. Just make it stop. Please make it stop. It hurts. Ah..."
28782,Stefan, Damon… help her
28783,Damon, I can help you. I want you to let me help you. I can help you
28784,Elena, How?
28785,Damon, Turn it off
28786,Stefan," What? No, no"
28787,Damon," Just turn it off, and everything will go away. That's what you have to do. It's what I want you to do. Just turn it off"
28788,Caroline," Hey it's me. Look, I hate to leave this on your voicemail, but I think that you need to know. Jeremy is dead, Tyler. I'm so sorry. I thought that you would call and I could tell you, but then you didn't so... Just call me when you get this, ok? I need you, and there's no way that yesterday was the last time that I'm ever going to see you or talk to you It can't be. So just... Call me, Tyler. Please"
28789,Bonnie," It's gonna be ok, Matt, you'll see. I'll bring him back"
28790,Matt," Get some sleep, Bon. We can talk tomorrow"
28791,Shane, Did you tell them?
28792,Bonnie, They don't think I can do it
28793,Shane," Oh, they're just scared. They're afraid to believe"
28794,Bonnie," You know, I've been thinking. You said if I dropped the veil to the other side that the dead will return, but that's only for the supernatural. What about the 12 people that died on the Young farm?"
28795,Shane," They were a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. They've passed on. They've found peace. It's all anyone wants. That's all Silas wants. We'll do this together, you and I. We are the beginning"
28796,Rebekah, Blast it. Shane
28797,Shane, Silas
28798,Stefan, It was a mistake
28799,Damon," It wasn't, and you know it. This is the only way she's gonna survive. We'll help her, keep an eye on her. When she's ready, I'll use the sire bond to bring her back"
28800,Stefan," Her humanity, Damon, it was all she had left"
28801,Damon," Humanity means nothing when you don't have anyone to care about, Stefan"
28802,Stefan, She had you
28803,Damon," She lost her brother. I'm not enough, not this time"
28804,Stefan," Listen, Damon. I know that you and I, we've been through some... Bad spots lately, especially when it comes to her"
28805,Damon, Yeah. Well... Guess none of that matters anymore
28806,Stefan," I just, um... I want you to know that, um..."
28807,Damon," I know, Stefan"
28808,Damon," Elena, don't do this. We can find another cover story"
28809,Elena, This is the best one. No one will ask questions
28810,Stefan," Ok. If you burn down the house, it'll be gone. What if one day when this is all over, you want to come home again?"
28811,Elena, I won't
28812,Stefan," We're gonna lose her, Damon"
28813,Damon, She needs time. It's only been a couple of days
28814,Stefan, Her humanity is off. She's basically numb to everything that makes her who she is
28815,Damon," She's a vampire. The off switch is one of the biggest perks. When being undead gets you down, voila. Vampire Prozac"
28816,Stefan, She b*rned down her family home with her brother's dead body still inside
28817,Damon," Saves us the trouble of having to do it ourselves. I call that a win. Worst-case scenario, I'll invoke the sire bond and tell her to turn it back on"
28818,Stefan," No. Her brother just died. You force all that grief on her at once, it's gonna overwhelm her. We need to give her a reason to want to turn it on"
28819,Damon," Fine. We'll show her a good time. I know it's controversial, Stefan, but people actually like to have fun"
28820,Stefan, You really think that's gonna work?
28821,Damon, There's only one way to find out
28822,Woman, Are you all right? Was there an accident? Where are you hurt? Are you in pain?
28823,Elena, I don't feel anything
28824,Woman, I have a blanket in my car. Try not to move. I'll call for help
28825,Woman, What are you doing?
28826,Damon, That's enough
28827,Damon, I said that's enough. We agreed no k*ll
28828,Elena," This is the first person I've seen in days whose body isn't laced with vervain, and I'm hungry"
28829,Damon," You leave a trail of bodies, people are gonna start asking questions"
28830,Elena, I don't care
28831,Damon, I can't believe you're making me say this
28832,Damon, Show a little restraint
28833,Elena, I thought this was supposed to be fun
28834,Klaus," Have a care, mate. That's no way to treat a lady"
28835,Haley, You came
28836,Klaus," Well, you did say it was urgent. Oh, don't worry about him, love. He'll never make it through tomorrow night"
28837,Haley, What if there are more?
28838,Klaus," You were foolish enough to make a deal with Katerina Petrova. She used you to find the cure, and now you're nothing but a loose end. You'll be lucky if she lets you live"
28839,Haley, You said you would protect me
28840,Klaus," And I will, just as soon as you tell me everything you know about Katerina"
28841,Damon, So that's the plan? You're gonna take her back to school?
28842,Stefan," Well, the fun route didn't exactly pay off, did it?"
28843,Damon, I don't know. We got a free meal out of it
28844,Stefan," Look. Do you think I want to go to school and play chaperone? You can't go because you're not a student. Besides, you've got to go look for Katherine. I mean, Elena needs this cure now more than ever"
28845,Caroline," Not that anyone asked me, but I think taking her back to school is a great idea"
28846,Damon, Why are you here?
28847,Caroline, Blame it on your fancy water filters. Your house has the only vervain-free showers in town
28848,Damon," Oh, yeah. The mayor put vervain in the water supply. So many people to k*ll"
28849,Caroline," Yeah, and my mom says it's about to get worse, so she could use a little help"
28850,Damon," Fine. I'll go after the psychotic doppelganger. Stefan, you gonna go talk to the sheriff? Blondie, take her to school"
28851,Elena," Sounds like fun. What? It's nothing you guys haven't seen before and as for the ""going to school"" idea... I've got nothing better to do"
28852,Damon," Elena, it would make me very happy if you were in school today and studied hard... You know, get involved in whatever activities, and please, for me, no matter what, don't eat anyone. Okay?"
28853,Caroline," Hey, Tyler. It's me checking in. Things are just getting back to normal here, sort of. Elena's not quite there, but we're working on it. Look, I know that you can't call me back, but I keep thinking if I just leave these messages that when you do come home it'll be like you never left. Or that's the hope. Well, I'd better go. I love you, Tyler"
28854,Matt," Hey, have you seen Bonnie?"
28855,Caroline," Yeah. I called her last night. She's fine. She's just a little drained from, you know, everything"
28856,Matt, Can't really blame her
28857,Elena, I have an idea. Can you get me my old spot back on the cheerleading squad?
28858,Caroline," I mean, technically, yeah. I'm Captain, but I thought you hated cheerleading"
28859,Elena," I did, and now I think it would be really fun to jump around and toss people up in the air. It's not like the routines are that hard"
28860,Caroline, I... think that would make Damon really happy
28861,Klaus," Ah, what an unpleasant surprise"
28862,Damon," So I just came up with a list called things you suck at. Number one: Finding Katherine, ever. Number two: Covering up your secret phone conversations to that little backstabber Hayley. Yeah, so where is she, and what does she know about Katherine?"
28863,Klaus, I should help you? After you lot k*ll my brother and imprisoned me in the Gilbert living room?
28864,Damon," You might want to prioritize, Klaus. You have much bigger problems. Katherine has the cure. My guess is she's gonna want to cram it down your throat. You help me find Katherine, I'll get the cure, I'll give it to Elena, everybody wins. Just let me question Hayley about Katherine"
28865,Klaus," Can't help you, mate. Hayley's off limits. Although I did have a run-in with a vampire who may know where Katerina is. Too bad for you I bit halfway through his bloody neck he probably won't have much time for chit-chat"
28866,Liz," The entire supply of bl*od from the hospital, all the reserves, gone, just vanished"
28867,Stefan, I don't understand. Are you accusing us?
28868,Liz," No, I'm not accusing you, but this town is at a tipping point. Any more unexplained house fires, and things are gonna boil over"
28869,Stefan, I'm sorry
28870,Liz, I know it's not your fault. It's been a rough week. Miranda Gilbert was one of my best friends in High School. To see what's happened to her family... It's just...
28871,Stefan," Look, Liz... If there's anything I can do to help, I promise I will"
28872,Liz," Good. You need to. Whoever stole that bl*od put a lot of lives in danger and risks exposing all of you, my daughter included. So who can you think of who wants bl*od that bad, who would be so careless?"
28873,Caroline, The uniform still fits. You look fantastic. We are totally gonna kick grove hill's ass
28874,Elena, Yeah. Should be fun
28875,Girl," Oh, my God. You guys, I left my makeup back on the bus"
28876,Caroline, Wow. The competition's bigger than last year. I'm gonna go stretch
28877,Elena, I like your ribbon
28878,Girl," Um, thanks"
28879,Elena, I want it
28880,Girl," Yeah, but I'm using it, so go get your own"
28881,Caroline," Hey, where were you? We're going on any minute"
28882,Elena," I'm here, aren't I?"
28883,Caroline, What's with the ribbon? That's not even our colors
28884,Caroline, Are you out of your mind?
28885,Elena, What is your problem?
28886,Caroline, Feeding on the competition? Hello. Did you not hear what Damon told you?
28887,Elena," I did, but who cares? I'll do whatever I want"
28888,Stefan, Everything all right?
28889,Elena," Yeah, as soon as the queen backs off, everything will be fine"
28890,Caroline, Remember how Damon sired her to behave? It didn't really work
28891,Damon," What do you mean, she fed? I specifically told her, no feeding. The sire bond should make her listen"
28892,Stefan, Right. That's what I'm saying. The sire bond isn't working
28893,Damon, That's impossible
28894,Stefan," Think about it. Elena's sire bond stems from her feelings for you, right? With her humanity off, she has no feelings"
28895,Damon, All I wanted was to break that damn bond. You're telling me now this whole time all she had to do was turn it off? What happens if she turns it back on?
28896,Stefan," I don't know, but more importantly, where are you right now?"
28897,Damon," I'm at a truck stop in the boonies looking for a dead vampire that might lead to Katherine and the cure. Look, just grab her and get her home. I'll be there when I can"
28898,Damon, You. I thought you were still vacationing on Numbskull Island
28899,Rebekah," Well, I was looking for answers, and all I found was your Professor Shane, dead, and with him, anything anyone knows about the cure"
28900,Damon, Guess you won't turn into a real girl after all
28901,Rebekah," I'll get the cure. I just need Katherine, and I'm betting you can help me find her"
28902,Damon, Why would I help you?
28903,Rebekah, Because I was smart enough to bring a pinch of my brother's bl*od. How else would you interrogate a vampire who's practically dead from a wolf bite?
28904,Damon, Fine. Follow me. I might know where to look
28905,Klaus," So you're rested, you're fed. Tell me about Katerina"
28906,Haley," Most men get their power kick from torture and intimidation. With you, it's drinks and fine dining"
28907,Klaus," Well, in your case, I favor hospitality over unpleasantness, but I have been known to change my mind on a whim. Where is Katerina?"
28908,Haley, You seriously think I know?
28909,Klaus," You tipped her off as to what we were up to and set her on a course to find the cure. In return, she sent her lackey to snuff you out. Tell me, what did Katerina promise you?"
28910,Haley, I was in new Orleans trying to find information about my real parents. Katherine found me and told me she could help
28911,Klaus," An orphan? Well, that does explain your charming bravado. Abandonment issues will do it every time"
28912,Haley, Sounds like you would know
28913,Klaus," I'm the only one that can protect you. I'm happy to do so, provided you cooperate"
28914,Stefan," Hey, we need to talk"
28915,Elena, So talk. You can help me stretch
28916,Stefan, Did you feed on that cheerleader?
28917,Elena, Maybe
28918,Stefan," I see. You wouldn't happen to know anything about the hospital's missing bl*od supply, would you?"
28919,Elena, Trust me. I'm sick of bl*od bags. I prefer something a little warmer
28920,Stefan," Look, Elena, I know what you're going through. I was having the time of my life when I first turned, too. I didn't start ripping people's heads off until 1912. The next thing I know, I was k*ll an entire village"
28921,Elena, Am I supposed to be scared of becoming you?
28922,Stefan," Yeah, you are, because I know how deep down you can fall, and I know how difficult it is to climb back out. Come on. You're better than this"
28923,Elena, I don't know. Maybe this is the better version of me
28924,Man on p.A.," Up next, Mystic Falls' very own lady Timberwolves"
28925,Caroline, No way. You are not cheering
28926,Elena, Let's see you try and stop me
28927,Man on p.A.," Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for your very own lady Timberwolves"
28928,Caroline, Ready
28929,The team," L-o-l, o-m-g You're looking at Mystic Falls varsity! B-e-a-t, b*at those caps. B-e-a-t, b*at those caps. B-e-a-t, b*at those caps!"
28930,Stefan, What do you do for an encore?
28931,Elena, I'm pretty sure it doesn't involve another condescending lecture
28932,Stefan, No. I was impressed. Getting yourself on the cheerleading squad. Plenty of vervain-free v*ctim bused in for the competition. You played us all really well
28933,Elena, It wasn't that hard. You want me to be OK so badly that you hear whatever I want you to
28934,Stefan," Right. Well, you know, the problem with the gymnasium is, too many witnesses You got to go somewhere a little more private for some real fun"
28935,Elena," Oh, yeah? Where?"
28936,Stefan, I know this little dive bar off the b*at path
28937,Elena, Come on. You're bluffing
28938,Stefan," You're forgetting that I had my switch flipped in this town, too. I know where to take someone to have a good time"
28939,Stefan," But first, a little vervain, just to take the edge off"
28940,Rebekah, Why exactly would you think a sick vampire would check into a hospital?
28941,Damon, See that little bright thing in the sky? It's called the sun. He needs to avoid that. Plus the hospital is open 24/7. Not to mention he's hungry and delusional
28942,Rebekah, Impressive. You're like Sherlock Holmes with brain damage
28943,Damon," Stefan said the Mystic Falls hospital had its entire bl*od bank raided, too"
28944,Rebekah, It looks like our vampire gets around
28945,Damon, No. The guy's dying of a werewolf bite. He wouldn't have time to steal from both hospitals. This is someone else
28946,Rebekah, Who?
28947,Damon," That's another problem. But on the plus side, if our guy did by chance come here, he's got nothing, which means he's nearby and he's hungry"
28948,Rebekah, This better not be a wild goose chase
28949,Damon, I want to find Katherine as much as you do
28950,Rebekah, Really? Why? I heard your little chat with Stefan. I know Elena has broken the sire bond. So why would you want to find the cure? You'd just cure her back to loving your brother. I think you're better off leaving it for me
28951,Haley, Hate that. Too much. I don't get that. Hmm... I don't care
28952,Haley, Hmm. This one. It doesn't make me want to puke. Why'd you paint it?
28953,Klaus," Painting is a metaphor for control. Every choice is mine... The canvas, the color. As a child, I had neither a sense of the world nor my place in it, but art taught me that one's vision can be achieved with sheer force of will. The same is true of life, provided one refuses to let anything stand in one's way"
28954,Haley," So this is your thing... Show a girl a few mediocre paintings, whine about your childhood, and I swoon and spill all my dirty secrets?"
28955,Klaus," I felt I had many charms, but, uh, regardless, I'm enjoying myself"
28956,Haley," And you do whatever you enjoy, up to and including hunting my friend Tyler for the next century"
28957,Klaus," Oh, surely not the next century. Only until I k*ll him"
28958,Haley," You talk a good game, but the truth is you let him go. My guess: You know if you k*ll him, Caroline will hate you forever"
28959,Klaus," If I simply k*ll Tyler, my revenge would be over in a moment. Sentencing him to a lifetime of paranoia and fear... That's Tyler's true punishment. But come now. You never really thought there was a future for you two, did you?"
28960,Haley, I don't know. He might have left Caroline for me if I'd used the cure to k*ll you
28961,Klaus," You know, if Tyler has even half your resolve, he may actually make it through the year"
28962,Haley," It doesn't take resolve. It takes allies, a network of people willing to do anything for you, including chase down loose ends to their death. That's how Katherine escaped you all this time"
28963,Klaus, Perhaps you know the names of Katerina's special little helpers
28964,Haley, Maybe I know one or two. Maybe I'll even tell you
28965,Elena, What'd you do to me?
28966,Stefan, Brought you home before you can cause any more trouble
28967,Elena, So you're grounding me because I dropped Caroline on her thick head
28968,Stefan," No, because you fed on someone... In public"
28969,Elena, So? I was hungry
28970,Stefan, You're really gonna keep stripping in front of me? It's real mature
28971,Elena," I'm done cheering, so I'm gonna change"
28972,Stefan," Sure. When in doubt, manipulate people with sex. You know, that's the same trick Katherine used to pull"
28973,Elena," Don't compare me to Katherine. She's been running so long, she's afraid of her own shadow. I am not afraid of anything. I've shut it all off... all of it, including my feelings for you. But don't get me wrong. I mean, I see you standing there, and you look good. I remember our sex, and it was good sex. I just don't feel anything about it anymore. Though you clearly do. Why do you care what I do and who I k*ll?"
28974,Stefan," Because it's my fault that you're like this. I brought this into your life. Look, I've k*ll hundreds of people, and I have to live with that, but I'm not gonna live with the people that you k*ll or what that'll do to you. Who are you texting?"
28975,Elena, OK. Your whole world revolves around me. Maybe you're the one that needs to turn it all off
28976,Stefan, So that's what all this texting was about? You invited all these people over here
28977,Elena," You were trying to keep me from throwing the party, so... I brought the party here"
28978,Stefan, Great. That's great
28979,Caroline, I got here as soon as I could. This is insane
28980,Stefan," Yeah. It won't last. They'll either drink all the booze and get bored, or Damon will come home and k*ll everyone"
28981,Caroline, We can't compel them to leave. The locals are all on vervain from the town water supply. So what do we do?
28982,Stefan," I don't know. Enjoy the party, keep Elena from butchering grove hill's cheerleading squad"
28983,Caroline, Great. And where is she?
28984,Stefan, Where do you think?
28985,Caroline, I almost forgot what that was like
28986,Stefan, What? Elena smiling?
28987,Caroline," No. Fun. I mean, look at her. Yes, this is all very bad, but doesn't she make you just want to let go?"
28988,Stefan," Well, unfortunately I have this little problem when I, uh, party too hard. I end up k*ll people"
28989,Caroline," Well, your sober coach is giving you the green light. I mean, come on. You are at a kegger full of hot girls, and you're single, and you're, well, you"
28990,Stefan," So, what am I supposed to do, just grab some girl, throw her over my shoulder, take her out onto the dance floor?"
28991,Caroline," Just take your own advice. Have fun, you know? We deserve a little bit of fun"
28992,Caroline, Whoa! I didn't mean me!
28993,Rebekah," Well, nobody could ever mistake you for subtle"
28994,Damon, You have to take pride in your work
28995,Damon, It's OK. Come here. Now you're gonna walk very slowly to your car. Off you go
28996,Rebekah," You know, I just don't see how this increases our odds any"
28997,Damon," I've been on the other side of a wolf bite. First you get really sick. Then you get really hungry. Since the sun's gone down, I'm imagining he's gonna be looking for his last supper. I just laid out a 3-course, 115-pound meal for him"
28998,Vampire, Damon?
28999,Damon, Will?
29000,Will, Hey buddy. I think there's something wrong with me. I need help
29001,Damon, Yeah. It's OK. Yeah. I know what to do
29002,Rebekah, What the bloody hell are you doing?
29003,Damon, Too far gone. Put him out of his misery
29004,Klaus," My sister informs me that your vampire assailant is dead, so you're safe and free to go. Or stay"
29005,Haley," I could be persuaded to stay, enjoy some of the good life. And maybe I could drum up a few more of Katherine's secrets and you could do something for me"
29006,Klaus," Oh, I'm sorry, love. You'll never convince me to let Tyler go free"
29007,Haley," Well, then, I guess I'll never get my chance with Tyler any more than you'll get a sh*t with Caroline. Do you want to know why I like that painting?"
29008,Klaus," Well, perhaps it was because it allowed you to see into my deep, wounded soul"
29009,Haley, I saw how twisted it really is. And maybe I can relate
29010,Klaus, So what's it gonna be? Going... or staying?
29011,Haley," You like to be in control, you told me"
29012,Elena, Look who finally joined the party
29013,Stefan, Yeah. Why? Are you jealous or something?
29014,Elena," No. That would imply emotions, and we've already established those are useless"
29015,Caroline," Come on, Elena. Just dance with us"
29016,Elena," No. You guys look good together. By all means, Care, just take him out for a spin. He could use it"
29017,Liz, Elena? What's going on in here?
29018,Elena, Just some underage drinking and drug use
29019,Liz, Where's Stefan?
29020,Elena, He's actually busy flirting with your daughter. But I think he's a good rebound for her because of the whole Tyler thing
29021,Liz, I'm shutting this down right now
29022,Elena," Liz, please. Why don't you just stay and have a drink?"
29023,Liz," Elena, take your hand off me"
29024,Elena," Either you have a drink, or I will"
29025,Caroline, Mom!
29026,Liz, It's fine
29027,Stefan," Caroline, calm down"
29028,Caroline, Calm down? I'm gonna wring her skinny little neck!
29029,Caroline, Elena! Where the hell is she?
29030,Stefan," Right where she wants to be. This is completely calculated. She drew all those people to the house, waited for an opportunity to distract us, and now she's free"
29031,Caroline," I can't believe she's doing this. I mean, she hurt my mom, Stefan"
29032,Stefan," All right, listen. You search the woods. I'll check the road. If you see her, don't hesitate. Just snap her neck, all right?"
29033,Caroline, Yeah
29034,Stefan, Ok
29035,Damon, Thank you
29036,Damon, Will you please just take a hint and leave me alone?
29037,Rebekah, What are you hiding? I know you knew that vampire
29038,Damon, I know a lot of dead people
29039,Rebekah, You k*ll him to prevent me from finding Katherine to keep me from getting the cure
29040,Damon," Do you really want the cure? I mean really? Look. Let me give you a little bit of advice. See these girls? They look happy now. In 5 years, they're gonna settle for a mediocre starter husband and a mind-numbing career, and about that time, they're gonna realize something you're never gonna have to learn"
29041,Rebekah, And what would that be?
29042,Damon," Life sucks when you're ordinary. And what makes you exactly not like them? You're a vampire. You take that cure, become human, well, you're no one, nothing. Trust me. Losing this cure is the best damn thing that ever happened to you"
29043,Caroline," Elena! Don't make me fight you, Elena! I'm stronger than you, and I don't want to hurt you"
29044,Elena, Who's gonna get hurt?
29045,Elena," Not bad. Not technically good, but then again, Alaric didn't train you. You were probably too busy butting into people's business!"
29046,Caroline," Oh, just stop! God. This isn't you, and you know it! You hurt my mom, Elena. How far are you gonna take this?"
29047,Elena," Are you trying to make me feel bad for hurting your mom? Don't you get it? I don't care. I mean, maybe you should try to turn it all off. Who knows? You might stop whining about how Tyler left you. An added bonus: You won't have to feel guilty about all the dirty thoughts you have about Klaus"
29048,Caroline, Shut up!
29049,Elena, Make me
29050,Elena, You fight like a girl
29051,Elena, Let go off me!
29052,Damon," I admit, under any other circumstances, this would be a major turn-on. Get her out of here"
29053,Caroline," Hey, Tyler. It's me. You'll never believe the crazy day I've had. Look, I know that you said you wouldn't, but I really wish that you would answer. It would be great to talk to you"
29054,Stefan, Are you alright?
29055,Caroline, Besides the fact that my best friend tried to k*ll me?
29056,Stefan," Look, it's not her. You have to remember that. With her emotions off, she's the worst version of herself"
29057,Caroline," So how do we get her back? Or what if we can't? Why would she choose to turn her emotions back on? She's an orphan. She just lost her brother. Her life sucks, Stefan. So why would she come back to us?"
29058,Stefan," Even when I was at my worst, Elena didn't give up on me. So we can't give up on her. Deal?"
29059,Elena, How much longer am I supposed to sit here?
29060,Damon," Well, I'm not big on goal-setting, but let's just imagine a time when you don't want to k*ll your best friend"
29061,Elena, Are you judging me? How many times have you tried to k*ll Stefan?
29062,Elena, What is that?
29063,Damon," One of life's many mysteries. Elena, look..."
29064,Elena," Don't. Every time someone starts with ""Elena,"" I get some stupid lecture. Everyone just needs to stop telling me that I need to feel. I do feel, Damon. I feel amazing"
29065,Damon, You don't want to be like this
29066,Elena," Then how should I be? Should I go back to being the scared little girl who couldn't admit what she wants? Is that how you'd prefer me to go back to being, or... Look. For the longest time, you wanted to be with me, but you were scared that I'd find out how awful you are. But it doesn't matter anymore because I don't care. Be honest. You like me better like this"
29067,Caroline, Matt?
29068,Matt, Care
29069,Caroline," Matt, why can't I get inside?"
29070,Matt, Come in
29071,Caroline," Matt, what's going on?"
29072,Matt, Tyler sent me this package in the mail. This is for you
29073,Tyler," Dear care, I miss you more than I can put into words, but I know as long as Klaus is alive, I can't come home. He won't stop trying to k*ll me, and you won't stop trying to protect me. Which means the only way to make sure you're safe is for me to go and never come back. I left Matt the deed to the house. It will protect you in ways I can't anymore. I will always love you"
29074,Caroline, He's not coming back
29075,Klaus," Running away, little wolf?"
29076,Haley, What?
29077,Klaus, That mark. I've seen it before
29078,Haley, Yeah. It's a birthmark. People have those
29079,Klaus," In my considerable lifetime, I've only seen that mark on a handful of others, all from the same bloodline... A werewolf clan that once thrived throughout much of what we now call Louisiana"
29080,Haley, Don't lie to me... Not about this
29081,Klaus, I wouldn't dare. Matters of family are sacred
29082,Haley, Tell me
29083,Stefan, Sheriff Forbes. Everything OK?
29084,Liz," No, we have a bigger problem"
29085,Damon, Hey
29086,Stefan, Where the hell are you?
29087,Damon, Out for a drive. I need some space. It's not me. It's you
29088,Stefan," Well, we got a little problem. You said bl*od was stolen from grove hill's hospital. The sheriff said there's been report of 6 other bl*od bank thefts all within 30 Miles of Mystic Falls. Somebody's stockpiling bl*od It wasn't Elena, and it's not us"
29089,Damon, Ok so…
29090,Stefan," I think Silas followed us back from that island. Hasn't fed in 2,000 years, so he would need to gorge on bl*od. It explains the thefts"
29091,Damon," You know, I'm really not in the mood to Scooby Doo our way through the case of the stolen bl*od supply, so why don't you hold the fort down until I get back, and I'll be in touch, brother"
29092,Elena, He's gonna hate you for that
29093,Damon," Yeah, well, emotions are overrated"
29094,Elena, So where are we going?
29095,Damon, A place every newbie vampire should go at least once in their life... New York. The city that never sleeps
29096,Woman, You were right
29097,Man, Told you
29098,Woman, That was really good
29099,Man, Yeah? Glad you liked it
29100,Woman, Yeah. Thanks for inviting me
29101,Man, Do it again next weekend?
29102,Woman, If you're lucky
29103,Woman," Oh, God. Is he... do you think he's dead?"
29104,Man, I don't know. Stay there
29105,Man," Oh, my God!"
29106,Man," You're that serial k*ll, aren't you? The son of Sam"
29107,Damon," Son of Giuseppe, but close enough"
29108,Elena, You dragged me all the way to New York because you were feeling nostalgic?
29109,Damon, No. I dragged you to New York because in a matter of 3 days you managed to piss off everyone in Mystic Falls. A little more difficult to do in a city of millions
29110,Elena, I was hungry
29111,Damon, You were reckless
29112,Elena, Emotionless. There's a difference
29113,Damon, Look. All that matters is that when I lived here I fed like crazy and had a blast and went undetected for years
29114,Elena, So we're just here to have fun? What's the catch?
29115,Damon," There's no catch. Look. You wanted out. I got you out. You wanted to feed, I brought you to a city-sized all-you-can-eat buffet. That's the beauty of New York. There's so much life that a little death goes unnoticed. Come on. Let's go get some lunch"
29116,Stefan, Wait. What do you mean you took her to New York?
29117,Damon, And that tone is the reason I didn't pick up the phone the first 20 times you called
29118,Stefan, Where is she now?
29119,Damon, Out exploring. Maybe she's eating a hot dog... Vendor
29120,Stefan, So I take it your search for Katherine is off
29121,Damon," Relax, man. This little joy ride is actually a cure hunt. That vampire that Katherine sent after Hayley is a friend of mine. He lived in the city. Will gets vampires fake identities, and I'm sure that Katherine's one of his clients"
29122,Stefan," And Elena's ok with this little field trip? Just yesterday, she was living the vampire high life. She doesn't want the cure"
29123,Damon, That's why I didn't tell her
29124,Stefan," Damon, if she finds out you're still looking for it, she'll bolt"
29125,Damon," I'm aware of that, Stefan. What I'm hoping is she's gonna be so wasted on booze and bl*od that she won't even think about it"
29126,Stefan, Don't underestimate her
29127,Damon," If I can handle you when you flip your switch, I can handle her. Trust me"
29128,Stefan, Listen to me. She's ruthless without her humanity. The cure's the fastest way to get it back
29129,Damon," Just be a good brother and keep Mystic Falls afloat for me and let me do my thing. You've got an immortal named Silas to deal with, remember?"
29130,Klaus, Desperate times I take it
29131,Caroline, What are you doing here?
29132,Klaus," Not judging you for starters, although if you are determined to get drunk, then perhaps I might recommend something a little more sanitary"
29133,Klaus," Well, then. You showed me"
29134,Caroline," Shouldn't you be out chasing Tyler to the ends of the earth, or are there some hopes and dreams you want to crush around here?"
29135,Klaus, Depends. Do you happen to know where the young Brutus is?
29136,Caroline," I know where he's not... with me. He gave Matt the deed to the house, so he's gone for good"
29137,Klaus, Tyler made it his life's mission to k*ll me. You can't hate me for driving him away
29138,Caroline," No. I can, and I do. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to spiraling, so go away"
29139,Stefan," Actually, I asked him to be here. We need his help. I think Silas is in Mystic Falls"
29140,Silas/Shane," Ok, come on .Take a deep breath. And 5, 4..."
29141,Bonnie, I can't do this
29142,Silas/Shane," Bonnie, relax, ok? Trust me"
29143,Bonnie, How can I trust you if you won't show me your real face? Don't you think it's a little creepy that you're appearing as my dead professor?
29144,Silas/Shane," I told you that I'm Silas, I told you Shane died on the island. I'm trying to earn your trust. All right. Look. You invited me into your home, right? Why? Why'd you lie to your friends and tell them everything was fine? Why did you convince your dad that you needed Professor Shane's help to control your magic? What am I doing here?"
29145,Bonnie, You're in my head. You're making me see things and do things
29146,Silas/Shane," Hey. Now. See? Look. I'm strong, but you're a witch, and I can't force you to do anything that you don't already want to do. You care about Jeremy, right?"
29147,Bonnie, Yeah
29148,Silas/Shane," Yeah. You were with him, and you promised to protect him, but you failed, and now in order to bring him back..."
29149,Bonnie, I need to get rid of the other side
29150,Silas/Shane," You are descended from Qetsiyah, one of the most powerful witches of all time. Only you can complete the triangle and cast the spell"
29151,Bonnie, Completing the triangle means k*ll 12 people
29152,Silas/Shane," 12 people you can bring back. Bonnie, you can do this for Jeremy"
29153,Klaus," So some bl*od went missing from a few hospitals. What about Elena? Don't vampires with their humanity off tend to overindulge in human bl*od, or were you the exception?"
29154,Stefan, It’s not Elena
29155,Klaus," Well, let's say for a moment that it was Silas. I'm struggling to see how this affects me"
29156,Stefan," Look. Silas wants to die and be reunited with his one true love, but he's supernatural, so if he takes the cure and dies, he gets stuck on the other side"
29157,Klaus, How Shakespearian
29158,Stefan," But if he destroys the other side altogether, he can take the cure, die, and pass on, but in destroying it, every dead supernatural being will return to our side"
29159,Caroline," That means every werewolf, every witch, every vampire. I wonder how many of those you personally k*ll. Care yet?"
29160,Klaus, My interest is piqued. How do we stop him?
29161,Stefan," Bonnie said Silas needs to complete 3 massacres to do this spell. Before Professor Shane died, he convinced the pastor to blow up the council. Next, he had you k*ll your hybrids, and now he only needs one more m*ssacre, so if he's here, that's what he's doing. We need to find him"
29162,Damon, Looks about right
29163,Elena, I was promised hedonism
29164,Damon," Well, it's early. Hedonism isn't a big fan of the sunlight"
29165,Elena, Or soap
29166,Damon," Easy, Judgy. Not everybody got a hot new haircut today. Give it a couple of hours. This place will be crawling with more punked-out nihilists than you can eat in a decade, trust me"
29167,Elena, How do you know?
29168,Damon," Because I spent most of the seventies here. The factory was too clean, CBGB's was too high-profile, but Billy's... Billy's was the underground of the underground"
29169,Damon, There you go
29170,Will, Two for one. Rock 'n' roll
29171,Damon," That's the third 5'7"" brunette I've gotten from you, Billy boy. Is that the same client?"
29172,Will, She's a runner. Some vampires need more identities than others
29173,Will, Hey. Be discrete
29174,Damon," I k*ll people and give you their I.D.S, you let me feed in your club. Discretion was never part of the deal"
29175,Damon, Lexi?
29176,Lexi," You're gonna feed on him right here? You're getting sloppy, Damon"
29177,Elena, You got Lexied?
29178,Rebekah," Following a lead without me? Poor form, Damon. I have to say I'm a little hurt, Damon. I thought we made a good team. Not without its fireworks, but what classic pairing isn't?"
29179,Elena, Wait. What the hell are you talking about?
29180,Rebekah, Damon's following a lead to the cure. I'm following him. Notice your name never came up
29181,Elena, You're doing what?
29182,Damon," How does it feel to be wrong all the time? I brought Elena here to feed. I mean, Mystic Falls isn't exactly vamp Xanadu right now"
29183,Rebekah, Right. So you drove 7 hours to New York City?
29184,Damon," Yes, and as I was explaining to Elena before we were so rudely interrupted, that my history in this city has a particular resonance to her current situation. When I had my humanity off"
29185,Lexi, That explains it. Your switch is flipped
29186,Damon, I can't even hear my prey over your constant babbling
29187,Lexi, You're not even covering your tracks. We heard about you back in Mystic Falls
29188,Damon," So Stefan sent you. Hmm. I thought we were on the off part of our endless on-again, off-again, eternity-of-misery cycle"
29189,Lexi, Lucky for you he cared just enough to send me. So why'd you flip it? What traumatic event was too much for Damon Salvatore to handle?
29190,Damon," ""Leave it to beaver."" The fifties bored me"
29191,Lexi," Well, it's the seventies now, and keeping it off is gonna get you caught and k*ll"
29192,Damon, And I'll chance it
29193,Lexi, I won't. I promised Stefan...
29194,Damon," Look, you and Stefan have a thing. He falls off the wagon, you pick him up. He's redeemed; you get your Florence nightingale jollies, ok?"
29195,Damon, But that's not me. I'm not him. I don't want or need you
29196,Lexi, Too bad because you got me
29197,Rebekah, Wow. She sounds dreadful
29198,Damon, She had a mother Teresa complex
29199,Elena," So let me guess. After many dark nights with Lexi, she convinced you to turn your emotions back on, and that's exactly what you plan to do with me"
29200,Damon," You read the last page of a book first, too? I'm gonna get a drink, many drinks"
29201,Rebekah, So you really buy all this?
29202,Elena, Not one bit. I know he's after the cure. I'm not stupid
29203,Rebekah," Well, let's not say things we don't mean"
29204,Elena," Damon is like a dog with a bone. Stefan, too. They won't give up until they find the cure and then make me take it. So I guess I'm gonna have to find it first"
29205,Rebekah, You're playing him
29206,Elena, No. He's playing me. I'm just returning the favor
29207,Caroline, What are we even looking for?
29208,Stefan," Well, if Shane really was working with Silas, chances are he was helping him plan his next move"
29209,Caroline," Where, on his evil villain to-do list... steal bl*od, perform 3 massacres, pick up dry cleaning?"
29210,Klaus," Actually not to nit-pick, but we evil villains usually use minions to pick up our dry cleaning, that sort of thing"
29211,Caroline, Why is he necessary again?
29212,Stefan," Well, we don't know what Silas can do, so if we do have to go head to head with him, an original hybrid who can't die might come in handy"
29213,Klaus," Besides, Stefan and I work well together, or at least we did in the twenties"
29214,Stefan," Well, granted my emotions were off"
29215,Klaus, And that's why you were more fun just as Damon is probably relishing in Elena's emotionless company in New York
29216,Stefan, My brother knows what he's doing
29217,Klaus," Does he? Don't underestimate the allure of darkness, Stefan. Even the purest hearts are drawn to it. Still, I'm sure it will all be fine"
29218,Caroline," I think I found something. ""Symbolic figures in the dark arts."" Didn't Bonnie talk about expression triangles? Here"
29219,Stefan," ""In some schools of magic such as expression, human sacrifice can be used as a focus for power. It's rumored that the addition of two supernatural sacrifices compounds the mystical energy, creating an expression triangle."""
29220,Caroline, Humans... that was the council fire. Demons... Klaus' hybrid failure
29221,Klaus," Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a failure. What’s the third?"
29222,Caroline," Oh, no"
29223,Bonnie, You want me to k*ll witches?
29224,Silas/Shane, We've been over this. It's temporary. They'll come back
29225,Bonnie, What if I'm not strong enough?
29226,Silas/Shane," You are strong enough. Look. It won't be easy. Once they realize how strong you are, they'll channel each other one by one using spirit magic till they can strip you of expression. You have to endure them until all 12 are linked as one"
29227,Silas/Shane, Listen. Your dad's here. We have to convince him
29228,Rudy, Hey. How was the session?
29229,Silas/Shane," To be honest, not that great. The meditation isn't really working. Her magic's too strong"
29230,Rudy, You told me you could help her
29231,Bonnie," Dad, it's... it's not his fault"
29232,Rudy," Not his fault? He's the one who taught you this magic, and now he can't control it"
29233,Silas/Shane, Listen. We have an idea
29234,Rudy, I'm done listening to your ideas. I want you to get out of my house
29235,Bonnie, Dad! 
29236,Silas/Shane, We just call on the spirits
29237,Rudy, I want you out of my house! What the hell is happening to her?
29238,Silas/Shane, This happened to my wife. Expression consumed her. She had no control
29239,Bonnie," I need you to call mom. We need witches, a lot of them"
29240,Elena, Is this allowed? What would Lexi say?
29241,Damon, Lexi thought the only way I would turn my emotions back on was if I started enjoying my life again
29242,Rebekah," Do not tell me she took you to Bon Jovi concerts, too"
29243,Damon," No. Wrong decade. Lexi was not allowed to feed with Stefan. I didn't have that problem, and neither do you"
29244,Elena, I'm hungry
29245,Damon, Pick
29246,Elena, Don't scream
29247,Damon, Your turn
29248,Damon, Ugh. Packrat. Thanks Will
29249,Bonnie, Is it just you?
29250,Woman, This place wasn't easy to find
29251,Bonnie, Figured you wouldn't want to draw attention
29252,Woman, It will work. I'm Aja
29253,Bonnie, You friends with my mom?
29254,Aja," I was. After she became a vampire, we didn't have a whole lot in common"
29255,Bonnie, So she's not coming
29256,Aja," This is witch business. Look. I know you're scared, but I've dealt with expression before. I know the hold it can have on you"
29257,Bonnie, It's not that. I'm just... I'm strong. You won't be able to do this alone
29258,Aja," Oh, honey, who said anything about being alone? There's almost nothing as strong as a full coven, so I brought 11 of my closest friends. Won't be fun, but we're gonna cleanse you. You ready? Let's do this"
29259,Elena, Leave
29260,Rebekah, Looks like Damon gave us the slip
29261,Elena," Good. Hopefully he'll find whatever he's looking for, and then I can take it"
29262,Rebekah," And what if you can't? I mean, he is stronger than you. You know, I could help you. You want the cure off the table, I want to take it. We could work together"
29263,Elena, Work together? Don't you hate me?
29264,Rebekah," I hated the moral, self-righteous version of you, but this one's not so bad. Maybe it's your new haircut"
29265,Elena," Do you remember what it's like to be human... weak, fragile? Why would you want to go back to that?"
29266,Rebekah," Because someday, I want a family' of my own"
29267,Elena," And that's exactly why I don't want your help. The best part of having no emotions is that I can think rationally. I'll do whatever it takes to get this done. You're the opposite, a pile of neuroses and insecurities, hopes and dreams. You're basically one big emotional variable that I just don't really need"
29268,Rebekah, You just made me miss the old Elena
29269,Caroline," There's been two massacres. Pastor Young's farm is here, and the old Lockwood cellar, where you spitefully slaughtered 12 of your own hybrids, is here. According to the book, the expression triangle is equilateral, putting it here"
29270,Klaus, Somebody's been skipping their geometry classes. There are actually two places where the third m*ssacre could be
29271,Caroline," Well, you didn't let me finish"
29272,Caroline, Hey. What's going on? Did you find Bonnie?
29273,Stefan," No, but I talked to her dad. I think I found Silas"
29274,Aja," Call out to the sprits, Bonnie. Let them in. Phesmatos tribum... aah!"
29275,Bonnie, I can't. It's hurting. It hurts! Ohh!
29276,Aja, It's because you've rejected the spirits. The expression's consumed you. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras...
29277,Bonnie, I changed my mind
29278,Aja, Purgal animum sous...
29279,Bonnie, I don't want to do this anymore!
29280,Aja, Obscarus!
29281,Bonnie, Let me go!
29282,Aja, She's fighting. I need help. Link with me. Lend me your power
29283,All, Phesmatos repallus tantian...
29284,All, Maltuscanum anium par vas
29285,Aja, We need more strength!
29286,All, Phesmatos repallus tantian maltuscanum anium par vas
29287,Damon, So Silas is appearing as Professor Shane. Wouldn't be my first choice
29288,Stefan," Well, it would be if you needed to brainwash Bonnie into committing a m*ssacre"
29289,Damon, You need me to come home?
29290,Stefan, No we got it. How's the cure search going?
29291,Damon," Well... Not great. I mean, it's no m*ssacre in the making, but Rebekah trailed us here. Then in addition to my buddy being a brilliant identity thief, he's also a hoarder"
29292,Stefan, What are you trying to find?
29293,Damon," Will had a repeat customer, 5'7"" brunette. Said she was a runner"
29294,Stefan, Katherine
29295,Damon," Turns out I was helping her run from me. Ironic. Problem is I'm pretty sure that his filing system goes by birthdate, but I can't for the life of me remember Katherine's"
29296,Stefan," June 5, 1473"
29297,Damon," And that, brother, is why you are the better boyfriend"
29298,Damon," Well, will you look at that? It's all her former addresses, including a couple from the last two months. I mean, they're mostly P.O. boxes, but, hey, it narrows the search"
29299,Stefan," Well, you're welcome. So you headed back now?"
29300,Damon," No. Tomorrow morning. Got to keep up the ruse for the terrible twosome outside, pretend like I'm having a good time"
29301,Stefan, And you're not?
29302,Damon, I'll tell you tomorrow
29303,Damon, Sorry. I needed some quiet. Couldn't hear Stefan over the runaways 2.0
29304,Elena, Let me guess. He's worried
29305,Damon, Jealous mainly. He's having acid flashbacks of me and Lexi in the seventies in New York. I'll tell you about it over a drink. Come on
29306,Damon (voice over)," Lexi stuck with me for months, partying with me, showing me a good time, but late every night, she'd torture me in the worst way possible"
29307,Lexi, Tell me about her
29308,Damon, No
29309,Lexi," What did she look like, what did she sound like? Tell me everything you remember about her"
29310,Damon, Every night
29311,Will, And that's my cue. You have a nice fight. Try not to break anything
29312,Damon," Every night. Every night, we get wasted, and the second I bottom out, you have to bring up Katherine"
29313,Lexi," Because you loved her, and love is the most powerful emotion. If I can just get you to remember how you felt about her..."
29314,Damon," I don't want to remember. I mean, why do you care so much?"
29315,Lexi," Do you remember how we first met? It was 1864. Stefan had just k*ll you father, made you turn into a vampire, and he was k*ll his way through Mystic Falls. You hated him. Rightfully so, but before you left, you asked me to help him because no matter what happened, he was still your brother, and you cared about him. Now you need help, and he cares about you. We both do. Let me help you. Tell me about Katherine"
29316,Damon, Talking about Katherine's not gonna help me
29317,Lexi, Why not?
29318,Damon, Because she's not the person I care about
29319,Liz, It flipped. The switch. Why didn't you tell me?
29320,Damon," Because I barely felt it at first, but every night, it's gotten stronger. It worked. You worked"
29321,Elena, You and Lexi? Here on the bar?
29322,Damon," On the bar, on the stage, on the roof. It was a very long night"
29323,Elena, Yeeh
29324,Damon, Where you going?
29325,Elena, To the roof. I want to hear the rest of the story
29326,Damon, Ok
29327,Caroline, I just want to see where we are
29328,Klaus," You know, when we split up, you did have the option of going with Stefan"
29329,Caroline, Yeah? And leave Bonnie's life your hands? Fat chance. Do you even know how to read a map?
29330,Klaus," Yes, and do you know who taught me? My friend Magellan"
29331,Caroline," Wow! You had a friend. Was he drawn to your darkness, too?"
29332,Klaus," Actually, I was referring to Damon and Elena when I said that, but clearly it struck a chord with you"
29333,Caroline, It's because it's not true! There is no allure to darkness
29334,Klaus, Really? So you've never felt the attraction that comes when someone who's capable of doing terrible things for some reason cares only about you?
29335,Caroline," I did once when I thought he was worth it, but it turns out some people can't be fixed. People who do terrible things are just terrible people"
29336,Klaus," We're here, although judging by the lack of witches, here is not the correct location"
29337,Aja," Yield to the spirits, Bonnie! You can't fight us!"
29338,Stefan, Stop it. It's not what you think
29339,Aja, This is no place for a vampire
29340,Stefan, She's working for Silas
29341,Aja, Silas?
29342,Stefan, He brainwashed her to k*ll you. Wait. What are you doing?
29343,Aja," If Silas has her, she's lost. We can't save her"
29344,Aja, I have the power of 12 witches. You don't stand a chance!
29345,Stefan, They're linked. Bonnie's gonna k*ll them
29346,Klaus, Not if the witches k*ll her first
29347,Caroline," Ugh! Klaus, we need to save her"
29348,Klaus," How? The only way to stop the witches is to k*ll them, and then Silas gets what he wants"
29349,Aja," Spirits, take her soul. Free her from darkness"
29350,Caroline, Bonnie! Bonnie!
29351,Bonnie, The triangle is complete
29352,Elena," It's beautiful up here. I could do this, you know? The Lexi method. Hang with you, party with you. It wouldn't be the worst way to turn my emotions back on"
29353,Damon, I thought you hated emotions
29354,Elena, I do. Maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to... Spend more time with you. I've never done it on a rooftop before
29355,Damon, You're not missing much
29356,Elena," You don't have to take the high road, Damon. I'm not sired to you anymore. I want this. You want this."
29357,Elena, What?
29358,Damon," You really think that was gonna work, the sex, the temptation, the booze? What, are you kidding me? I invented that trick"
29359,Damon, Good luck! Spent all night reinforcing it. It was tough. Had to be really quiet not to wake you up
29360,Lexi, What is this?
29361,Damon, Payment
29362,Lexi, For what?
29363,Damon," Oh, for the last 6 months of my life, for the nagging for the self-righteous platitudes. I'm paying you back for 6 months of you"
29364,Lexi," Your humanity isn't back on, is it?"
29365,Damon, Never was
29366,Lexi, So this was all just...
29367,Damon," A joke! It was a big, fat lie. Best part of it is, you believed it. You thought I was a like Stefan, a wounded little bird that you could nurse back to health, but he's a v*ctim. I choose to be this way. Enjoy the day. I hear it's gonna be a scorcher"
29368,Elena, So you pretended to have feelings for her just to get her off your back?
29369,Damon, I was willing to do whatever it took. Sound familiar?
29370,Elena, Aw. I hurt your feelings
29371,Damon," Not my feelings. I'm looking out for you because one day, you will flip that switch back on, and all the bad stuff that you did is gonna come rushing back, and it is going to suck"
29372,Elena, So you're saying that you felt bad for Lexi?
29373,Damon," She became a walking, talking reminder of all the awful things I'd done. I managed to avoid her for decades, and then she just shows up in Mystic Falls to wish my baby bro Happy Birthday, and boom... rush of memories, rush of guilt"
29374,Elena, So you k*ll her?
29375,Damon," Out of sight, out of mind. Every day that you're like this is the day that you might do the one thing that you can't take back"
29376,Elena," Here's what I don't get. You spent 6 months trying to get her to fall in love with you just so that you could hurt her. You were spiteful, malicious, borderline evil, and you say that you had your emotions turned off, but those all sound like emotions to me"
29377,Damon," Maybe they were. Maybe hatred was the first one I got back. All the more reason to cure you. That way, we get the normal Elena back without all the ugly stages in between"
29378,Elena," I'm not taking the cure, Damon"
29379,Damon," Yes, you are, even if I have to break your neck or tie you up in chains until we find it"
29380,Rebekah, What was that you said about handling things yourself?
29381,Stefan, How you feeling?
29382,Bonnie, What are you doing here? How'd I get here?
29383,Stefan, What do you mean? I... I brought you home. The witches almost k*ll you
29384,Bonnie, What witches?
29385,Stefan, You don't remember? Whatever the witches did must have messed with your memory
29386,Bonnie, How did I get off the island?
29387,Stefan, Wait. Bonnie... What's the last thing you can remember?
29388,Bonnie," I guess I remember being in that cave, and Jeremy was trying to pry the cure out of Silas' hands. Please tell me he got it. We didn't get it, did we?"
29389,Stefan," Bonnie, there's something you need to know about Jeremy"
29390,Klaus," There. 12 graves for 12 witches. Like it never happened. Only it did happen, and now Silas has everything he needs to open the gates to hell on earth"
29391,Caroline, You were just gonna let Bonnie die
29392,Klaus," I know arithmetic isn’t your strong point, but one is still less than 12"
29393,Caroline," Yeah, but that one is my best friend"
29394,Klaus, You tell yourself whatever you need to so you can sleep at night
29395,Caroline, I just k*ll 12 people
29396,Klaus, Hey. Hey. You look like you're in need of comfort. Why don't you find someone less terrible you can relate to?
29397,Silas/Shane," Thank you. Of the 3 massacres, this is the one I was dreading"
29398,Klaus, Silas I presume
29399,Elena," Morning, Damon"
29400,Damon, Where are you?
29401,Elena, The better question would be where are we going? 
29402,Rebekah," Sorry, Damon. I think I broke your radio"
29403,Damon, You're in my car?!
29404,Elena," Heh. We weren't gonna take the bus. I wish this could have gone differently. I really do, but we'll give Katherine your best"
29405,Stefan," Damon, what did you do?"
29406,Damon," Let's just say it involves a 5'7"" brunette and her blond accomplice"
29407,Stefan, Please don't tell me this is going where I think it is
29408,Damon," Wrong fantasy, brother, unless you're into betrayal and snapped necks. The lead I had on Katherine Elena stole. If you're searching for the words to tell me how badly I screwed up, save your breath"
29409,Stefan, I didn't stop the m*ssacre
29410,Damon, Guess Silas has everything he needs
29411,Stefan, Everything but the cure
29412,Klaus," I'm sorry, mate. I don’t have it"
29413,Silas/Shane," But you know who does, and the last thing that you want is for that cure to be used on you, so you bring it to me, and it won't be. You get to live"
29414,Klaus," Heh. Yeah. With all of my dead supernatural enemies from the other side. You know, you don't scare me, Silas, or, Shane, or, whoever you are"
29415,Silas/Shane, I think I know what does
29416,Klaus, Now where did you get that?
29417,Silas/Shane," Well, let's just say your sister's mind is a little easier to read than yours. So… Care to reconsider my offer?"
29418,Silas/Shane," I missed by an inch, but don't worry. I'm not trying to k*ll you, not just yet. Just a little something to remember me by. I'll be in touch"
29419,Rebekah, Why are we stopping?
29420,Elena," We've searched 3 cities in the last 24 hours. I'm sick of top 40 radios, and I smell like leather"
29421,Rebekah, And that's my fault? You are the one who stole the list of Katherine's possible whereabouts. Did you ever think that Damon had bad information?
29422,Elena, Have I mentioned I can't stand the sound of your voice?
29423,Rebekah, Too bad. We're not done. Get in. Next town
29424,Elena, In a minute. I'm hungry
29425,Rebekah," We're not here for a pub crawl, Elena. I want the cure. Katherine has it. We don't stop until we find her"
29426,Elena," I said, in a minute"
29427,Woman," Oh, my god. You startled me"
29428,Elena, Did I?
29429,Woman," Katherine, what are you doing?"
29430,Elena, You know me?
29431,Woman," Of course. Um, I know most people around here prefer you to feed from the neck, but I asked you to drink from my wrist. Remember?"
29432,Rebekah, Conniving little bitch compelled the whole town
29433,Elena, I think we just found Katherine. What's my full name?
29434,Woman," Katherine Pierce. I love the new 'do, by the way"
29435,Rebekah, So how do you know Katherine?
29436,Woman, How do I know who?
29437,Elena, Me. How do you know me?
29438,Woman, Small town. Everybody knows everybody
29439,Rebekah, So everyone here knows Katherine
29440,Woman, I'm sorry. I don't know who you're talking about
29441,Rebekah, She compelled people to forget all about her unless she was talking to them herself. Clever girl
29442,Elena, How long have we known each other?
29443,Woman," Uh, it's been a while. I can't remember"
29444,Elena, Where do I live? Where do I work?
29445,Woman, I don’t know
29446,Elena, Who do I spend time with? Do I have any friends?
29447,Woman," Well, you said we could all be friends with you as long as we kept your secret"
29448,Elena, What secret?
29449,Woman, I… I don't know
29450,Damon, If they so much as even scratched the paint on my car…
29451,Stefan," Why don't you just be grateful sheriff Forbes was able to track down the car after you let them, uh... You know, steal it from you"
29452,Damon, Remind me to send her some mini-muffins. Do we really need 10 gallons of gas or are you making me just lug this around as punishment?
29453,Stefan," Well, they ditched your car after it ran out of fuel. We got to fill it up. We got a hundred miles before we get to Willoughby"
29454,Damon," Yeah, well, I don't remember that name from the list of places that I got in New York"
29455,Stefan," Oh, the list. You mean the list they stole from right under your nose after you let your guard down? They'll be there. Sheriff Forbes tracked down the car they stole after yours"
29456,Damon, Screw the muffins. I'll get her champagne if Elena is wherever it may be
29457,Stefan," Willoughby, cream corn capital of Pennsylvania. They'll be there. Let's just hope we get to them before they get to the cure"
29458,Damon," Ooh, silver lining. If Rebekah takes the cure, then she's mortal. And then we can just k*ll her right then and there"
29459,Stefan," Ooh, dark cloud. Elena stays a vampire forever. Look, why don't you just table the revenge fantasies for now and just keep your eye on the prize? Find Katherine, get the cure, get out before you get your neck snapped. Again"
29460,Damon," Believe me, I learned my lesson. Elena without humanity is a stone cold bitch. And I won't trust her until we get the old Elena back"
29461,Stefan, Look at that. We're finally on the same page about something
29462,Damon, Look at that
29463,Caroline, Klaus? We need to talk. What happened to you?
29464,Klaus, Silas. He attacked me. He stabbed me with the white oak stake. A piece of it is still inside me
29465,Caroline," My God, Klaus, that could k*ll you"
29466,Klaus, I certainly feel like I'm dying
29467,Caroline," And as much as I would love to watch you die, you still haven't found me that cure"
29468,Klaus, Silas!
29469,Caroline," That's right. Last night I looked like Shane. Today I look like Caroline. And tomorrow, who knows?"
29470,Klaus, Show me your real face
29471,Caroline," Now, why would I do that when I can look like whomever I want you to see? Resist me all you want, Klaus, but until you bring me the cure, I will bring you nothing but misery"
29472,Elena," Hey, excuse me. Um... Did I get any mail today?"
29473,Man, What happened to your hair?
29474,Elena, I cut it
29475,Man, In the last two minutes?
29476,Elena, I was here two minutes ago?
29477,Man," Are you feeling ok, Ms. Pierce?"
29478,Elena," Yeah. I'm…I'm fine. Um, thanks"
29479,Elena, She was here two minutes ago. That means that she can't be that far. How about you check inside? I'll look in the parking lot
29480,Rebekah, Ok
29481,Katherine," I'm impressed. I never thought you would find me here. Oh, well. It's a beautiful place to die"
29482,Rebekah, I couldn't agree more. You've chosen a beautiful place to die
29483,Elena, Where's the cure?
29484,Katherine," What, no ""I'm here to avenge my annoying little brother"" speech?"
29485,Elena, People die. We move on
29486,Katherine," After turning off our humanity switch. So sad for the boys, though. Their special snowflake of human frailty... Gone. Well, if we're gonna be a while, I'm gonna go grab some menus"
29487,Rebekah, You're not going anywhere
29488,Katherine, I forgot how charming you were
29489,Rebekah," I'm surprised you remember me at all, seeing as though you were so busy wedging yourself between my brothers"
29490,Waitress," Oh, my god. What happened?"
29491,Katherine," I'm fine, Jolene. You didn't see anything"
29492,Elena, Every minute you two waste with your yapping is another minute we give Stefan and Damon to find us
29493,Rebekah, Where's the cure?
29494,Katherine, I'm sorry. I'm on vervain
29495,Rebekah," Oh, I get to torture it out of you. Fun"
29496,Katherine, Why do you two want it anyway?
29497,Rebekah," The question is, why do you want it? Let me guess. To k*ll Niklaus"
29498,Katherine," I've spent the last 500 years running from your big brother. I have no intention of being within sniffing distance of him. But since it can be used against him, I'm sure he's just itching to get his hands on it. I give him the cure, he gives me my freedom"
29499,Elena," Ohh, you poor v*ctim. Where's the part of your plan where you screw us over and somebody dies?"
29500,Katherine," I have no reason to screw you over. I know you don't believe me, but it is the truth. People change. I'm not the girl you think I am"
29501,Katherine, I don't have it on me
29502,Rebekah," I didn't think you did, but I'm sure there's something in that that can help us find it"
29503,Elena, Who's Em?
29504,Katherine, A friend
29505,Elena, It says here you're meeting at 2:00. I guess I'll just have to meet Em myself
29506,Caroline, I got your 50 bajillion messages. This better be life and death
29507,Klaus, Go away
29508,Caroline, Klaus? Where are you?
29509,Caroline, What happened to you?
29510,Klaus, I need more time. Stop hounding me!
29511,Caroline, I'm hounding you?! I am supposed to be running 3 different prom committees right now and you keep phone stalking me
29512,Klaus, Caroline. Is it really you? Prove it to me
29513,Caroline," Ok. I don't know if this is some new way of flirting, but it sucks. And I have more important things to do"
29514,Klaus," Wait, please. Silas. He stabbed me with the white oak stake. There's a little piece of it stuck inside me"
29515,Caroline, Why would Silas attack you?
29516,Klaus," Well, I was in no position to ask questions. Suffice it to say, I'm hurt. So you can understand why I called you"
29517,Caroline," You ran Tyler out of town, you k*ll his mother, and you think I'm the person to call for help?"
29518,Klaus," If I die, you, Tyler, all of your friends die with me"
29519,Caroline, What do you want me to do?
29520,Klaus," Well, it's quite simple, really. I need you to cut the stake out of me"
29521,Damon," Something's not right. Katherine Pierce does not hole up in hicks town, p-a"
29522,Stefan," Well, this is definitely the car they stole. We're in the right place"
29523,Damon, Points to them for their choice in vehicles
29524,Stefan," So let me ask you something. What happens when we find Elena? How do we get her back to Mystic Falls? I mean, she's not exactly gonna go quietly. And she has an original vampire as her bodyguard"
29525,Damon, We do whatever we have to do. I don't care if we have to throw Rebekah under a school bus and wrap Elena in a burlap sack. We do whatever we have to do
29526,Stefan, I’m serious
29527,Damon," I am, too. I don't care what Elena wants right now. She's this close to going off the rails for good. And that ain't happening. She's a pain enough as it is"
29528,Stefan," So what happened to the guy who thought Elena should embrace being a vampire, let the chips fall where they may?"
29529,Damon, That guy got his neck snapped in New York. And this guy is royally pissed off
29530,Elena, What do you think?
29531,Rebekah, It's close. Not quite slutty enough. I think you need more eyeliner
29532,Elena, I'm gonna need your clothes
29533,Katherine, Yeah. That's gonna happen…
29534,Elena," Fine. Your bracelet, watch, earrings. Hand them over"
29535,Elena, And your other bracelet
29536,Katherine," That's my daylight bracelet. It's daytime outside. I'm gonna need it. Besides, it's not gonna work on you"
29537,Elena," Fine. I really am gonna need that jacket, though"
29538,Katherine," All right. Fine, fine, fine"
29539,Katherine," This will never work, you know? The bad haircut, the doe eyes… You'll never pass for me"
29540,Elena, You'll never pass for me
29541,Rebekah, Throatier and more mannish
29542,Elena, You'll never pass for me
29543,Katherine, You two are pathetic
29544,Elena, You two are pathetic
29545,Rebekah," Oh, perfect. Just the right level of contempt and hidden insecurity"
29546,Elena, Almost there. Something's missing
29547,Elena, Your shoes. I want your shoes
29548,Elena," Come on, Em"
29549,Rebekah," Mm. You know, it's funny. I've always been a little envious of the legend that is Katherine Pierce, the way you could wrap a man around your little finger, the way Elijah betrayed Klaus for you, the way the Salvatore brothers stumbled head over heels for you. And yet here we are all these years later in a town that you've had to compel into liking you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh. It's really more sad than funny"
29550,Katherine," You know you can't split the cure with Elena, right?"
29551,Rebekah, She doesn't want to
29552,Katherine," Oh, no? But you do. You want to take it. Are you really that dumb or just naturally blonde?"
29553,Rebekah, I want a normal life again
29554,Katherine," You mean you want a do-over. Well, guess what. You can't have it. The cure will only take away your immortality. Everything else you hate about yourself, you'll still wake up with that in the morning. And you won't even be able to compel yourself a friend"
29555,Stefan," Ladies, playing nice?"
29556,Katherine, There goes the neighborhood
29557,Damon," I see you got Katherine already. You're losing your touch, evil one"
29558,Stefan, Where's Elena?
29559,Elijah, Katerina
29560,Elena," Elijah. You're a little late, aren't you?"
29561,Elijah, You colored your hair. I like it
29562,Elena, Thank you. I was actually gonna…
29563,Elijah, I missed you
29564,Elena, And I've missed you
29565,Elijah, This is an interesting little town you've chosen to settle down in. So do you have it with you?
29566,Elena, Do I have what?
29567,Elijah, The cure
29568,Elena, It's in a safe place. Why don't I go and get it and then I'll bring it back?
29569,Elijah," Where's Katherine, Elena?"
29570,Rebekah," So let me get this straight, I tell you where Elena is, you shove the cure down her throat, and then I end up in a box, right? I don't think so"
29571,Damon," What about you over there, smiley? Do you know where she is?"
29572,Katherine, I can give you a hint. Start by looking at the town morgue. She's probably dead. She went to meet up with a friend of mine. You may know him… An original brother. Impeccable taste
29573,Rebekah, Elijah?
29574,Damon, Elijah's here?
29575,Stefan," Well, you sort of have to question Elijah's impeccable taste if he's friends with you"
29576,Katherine," Oh, when I say friend, I mean ""Friend"""
29577,Katherine," It probably took him about 10 seconds to realize that she wasn't me, at which point he probably yanked her heart right out of her chest"
29578,Stefan, All right. Where are they?
29579,Stefan," Rebekah, you do realize if something should happen to Elena, you have no chance of finding the cure, right?"
29580,Rebekah, Fine. They were supposed to meet at the gazebo by the park
29581,Stefan, I'll go talk to Elijah
29582,Rebekah, You deal with Elijah. Katherine will take us to the cure
29583,Katherine," No, she won't. The cure's my one chance to win my freedom back from Klaus"
29584,Damon, You're gonna broker a deal with Klaus?
29585,Stefan," No. She's gonna get Elijah to broker a deal for her. That's why you need your little friend, isn't it? Some things never change, Katherine"
29586,Damon, Nope
29587,Katherine, Fine. Move. You have to follow me
29588,Caroline," Oh, my god. You do have a heart. Oh, my bad. It's just a bloody rib"
29589,Klaus," Well, I'm glad you're finding my misery so amusing"
29590,Caroline," I swear there's nothing in here. And if you think I'm having fun, you're insane"
29591,Klaus, You k*ll 12 witches for your friend Bonnie. You can't even get your hands a little dirty for me. Here I thought we were becoming friends
29592,Caroline," Well, you thought wrong"
29593,Caroline, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
29594,Caroline," You know what? I'm not sorry. You deserve to suffer for everything that you've done. So today, we're gonna do things my way. You want my help? You let Tyler come back to town, and give me your word that you will not hurt him"
29595,Elijah, Katerina?
29596,Stefan, Hello. Elijah?
29597,Elijah, Where is Katherine?
29598,Stefan, Where's Elena?
29599,Elijah, Safe. How long she remains so depends upon you
29600,Stefan," Well, I guess the same goes for Katherine"
29601,Elijah, Katherine can take care of herself against the two of you
29602,Stefan, Oh. You mean the three of us 'cause your little sister decided to join team good guys for the time being
29603,Elijah, Put her on the phone
29604,Stefan," Oh, she's not here right now. I left her with Damon and Katherine"
29605,Elijah, Tell me where they are
29606,Stefan, Relax. No one's gonna get hurt as long as Katherine hands over the cure
29607,Elijah," Do you understand how much my sister despises Katherine? I assure you, Rebekah will end her the moment she ceases to be of use"
29608,Stefan," Well, just tell me where you are, and we can talk this through"
29609,Elijah," You listen to me very carefully, Stefan. If anything whatsoever happens to Katherine, I will descend upon Elena"
29610,Elena, You're both idiots
29611,Elijah, Excuse me?
29612,Elena," Ugh. What happened to you, Elijah? I mean, I thought you were supposed to be a man of honor. And yet you've been hooking up with Katherine this entire time?"
29613,Elijah," Well, I suppose this man of honor always shared a connection with Katherine. She contacted me when she learned about the cure. We thought we could be of mutual use to one another"
29614,Elena," ""Of mutual use""? Please. You fell for her trap just like every other one of those idiots"
29615,Elijah," You underestimate me, Elena. I know who she is. I know what she's done"
29616,Elena," And you think she's changed? She's playing you. She lied to you, Elijah"
29617,Elijah," She didn't lie to me about your transformation. You're not just a vampire, though, are you? There's something else. You...you're not yourself. You've abandoned your emotions. Why?"
29618,Elena, My brother's dead. Your girlfriend k*ll him
29619,Elena, You didn't know? Of course you didn't
29620,Elijah, She lied
29621,Elena," I hate to say I told you so, but... Duh!"
29622,Damon, No sudden moves. No tricks either. No katherine-ing. A quilt and a fish aquarium. Who the hell are you?
29623,Rebekah, A very old lady with dreadful taste
29624,Katherine," It's gone. The cure, it was in the safe, but it's not there"
29625,Damon," Not falling for it. Where is it, Katherine?"
29626,Katherine, I swear it was in the safe
29627,Damon," What just like Elijah's really your boyfriend and this is really your life? And for all we know, this isn't even your house. It doesn't look like the Katherine I know"
29628,Katherine, Maybe you don't know Katherine at all. Did it even occur to you that you have no idea who I really am?
29629,Damon," Did it even occur to you that you're not that deep? This whole small-town girl thing, we know it's an act"
29630,Rebekah, Where is the cure?
29631,Damon," Whoa, whoa. Hang on. We need her alive. The cure's not here. You check upstairs. I'll check down. I got this"
29632,Damon," So if I was a paranoid, distrustful sociopath, where would I keep my most prized possession?"
29633,Katherine, This should be fun
29634,Damon," Because I'd want it to be close, but not on me. Accessible but not obvious. I'd want to keep it safe, but not so safe that it'd be too difficult to grab and run"
29635,Damon," Well, that is a fancy little treasure chest in a t*nk with no fish. I think I'm gonna have to check that out"
29636,Damon, Vervain water. Looks like we have a winner
29637,Rebekah, Give it to me or you're dead
29638,Katherine," You're gonna k*ll me anyway. So what's more important to you, huh? k*ll me or getting the cure?"
29639,Damon," Look, Rebekah... Don't even think about it. Let's just talk about this, like the two rational vampires that we are. Rebekah?"
29640,Rebekah," Oh, give it a rest. Me taking this cure is the best thing that'll ever happen to you"
29641,Damon, Don't do anything stupid
29642,Rebekah," Admit it. You don't want human Elena running back to Stefan whilst you're left out in the cold again. Go on, Damon. Tell me why you want Elena to have the cure"
29643,Stefan, No!
29644,Klaus, I can feel the splinters moving towards my heart. Help me!
29645,Caroline, Your word first
29646,Klaus, And what makes you think I won't simply break my word?
29647,Caroline, You want to be friends? Friendship—stage one. Show me that I can trust you
29648,Klaus, I saved your life... twice
29649,Caroline, Because you put it in danger... twice. Why can't you just do something decent for once?
29650,Klaus, Because Tyler Lockwood tried to k*ll me
29651,Caroline, We've all tried to k*ll you. And you've tried to k*ll most of us. How do you think that you deserve my friendship when you've done nothing to earn it?
29652,Klaus, I will not have my hand forced by you or anyone else!
29653,Caroline," What is wrong with you? I'm reaching out to you despite everything that you have done, and you still can't get out of your own way. God! I feel sorry for you"
29654,Klaus, Don't turn your back on me!
29655,Caroline, I should have turned my back on you ages ago!
29656,Klaus, It's gone
29657,Caroline, What?
29658,Klaus," The pain. The pain is gone. It was… it was never there. He got in my head. Silas... got inside my head. You took my mind off it. You brought me back, Caroline"
29659,Caroline," If Silas can make you, of all people, believe that you're dying... What can he do to the rest of us?"
29660,Stefan, Did you even try to stop her?
29661,Damon, You forgot the part where I was bobbing for boxes in vervain water
29662,Stefan," All you had to do was stall her, Damon"
29663,Damon," Sorry. It's Rebekah. I didn't have a pony to distract her, Stefan"
29664,Stefan," You let her take it, didn't you? You were never on my side. Now Elena will be a vampire for the rest of her life just like you wanted"
29665,Elijah, I know what it feels like to lose a brother. I'm sorry for your pain. I... I only hope that you can find your way back to yourself someday
29666,Elena, Just like you hope Katherine will find her way back? You still think that innocent girl you saved from Klaus ages ago is in there somewhere
29667,Elijah," I'd like to think so, yes"
29668,Elena," She's not. She's a monster now, Elijah. The sweet peasant girl you fell in love with way back when is dead and she's not coming back"
29669,Elijah," I'm not a fool, Elena. Of course this has occurred to me, but what kind of man would I be if I didn't try to find my Katerina beneath this Katherine facade?"
29670,Elena," You boys are all the same. Damon and Stefan still think that the girl they love is still in here somewhere, too"
29671,Elijah," You can't blame them for having hope, Elena. It'd be a shame if the world lost a soul as compassionate as yours"
29672,Elena," ""Your compassion is a gift, Elena. Carry it with you always and forever."" I remember reading that in a letter once"
29673,Elijah," Well, the writer sounds positively gifted. I'm sure he meant what he wrote"
29674,Elena, I'm sure he did. And it felt good to watch that letter burn along with my old life and along with Jeremy's body
29675,Katherine, Sorry. I got held up
29676,Stefan, How do you feel?
29677,Rebekah, I…I feel good. I... I feel great. I feel alive
29678,Damon, Slight problem with being alive… I can k*ll you now
29679,Rebekah, I'm still a vampire. The cure didn't work
29680,Stefan, It worked just like she wanted it to. The cure was a fake. It must have been a concentrated sh*t of vervain or something
29681,Damon, Katherine…
29682,Katherine," Oh, come on. She could use a nap. It must be exhausting trying to be me"
29683,Elijah, You k*ll Jeremy Gilbert
29684,Katherine," Yes, Elijah. I k*ll Jeremy Gilbert. A b*mb, I'm sure she just couldn't wait to drop on you. Ironic, since she supposedly doesn't care about anything"
29685,Elijah," I care. Do you honestly feel nothing for this girl, a girl fated to live the same life that you've endured? And now you've just taken away the last of her family, just as yours was taken away from you"
29686,Katherine," Uh, why are you looking at me like I enjoyed it? Jeremy was collateral damage. I was doing what I needed to do to survive"
29687,Elijah," Is that what I am, too? A means of survival?"
29688,Katherine, Don't let sweet little Elena get to you. She hates me. She wants you to turn against me and convince you that I can't be trusted
29689,Elijah, I asked you a question
29690,Katherine, No. Of course you're not a means of survival. You looked out for me when I had no one. You're giving me a second chance now when no one else will. I love you Elijah. You don't believe me
29691,Elijah," I want to. It's my disease. I just keep wanting to believe you, but how can I when at every turn; you give me reason to doubt you? I don't know you. I don't know that I ever will"
29692,Katherine, Wait. You gave me your word that you would talk to Klaus. I… I can't make a deal without you
29693,Elijah," Good-bye, Katherine"
29694,Woman," Katherine, hey. What brings you by at this hour?"
29695,Katherine, I came to retrieve my package
29696,Woman," Oh. Of course. Like I said, your secret would be safe here"
29697,Woman," Hey, um... all the secrecy. Can I ask, what is it?"
29698,Katherine, It's my freedom
29699,Katherine, Wait
29700,Elijah, What do you want?
29701,Katherine, To tell you that you're right. I've spent so much time running and lying just to survive that I don't… I'm starting to believe my own lies. I don't even remember who I was when we first met. And I want to find out
29702,Elijah, You have the cure
29703,Katherine," Yeah. And I can shove this down Klaus's throat and try to k*ll him, but even if I manage to do it... I'd lose you. And I don't want that to happen"
29704,Elijah, How do I know this isn't another lie? Katherine Pierce deceiving yet another man
29705,Katherine," Because I meant what I said about my feelings for you. And I'd like to think that you feel something for me, too. I need you to trust me. I want you to trust me... Just like I'm trusting you"
29706,Katherine, You don't owe me anything. I'm gonna let you decide where we go from here
29707,Rebekah, You and Katherine? And I thought you were the smart brother
29708,Elijah, You don't have a smart brother. It turns out I'm just as stupid as the rest of you
29709,Rebekah, Why don't you just give me the cure so I can judge you silently elsewhere?
29710,Elijah, And what could you possibly want with the cure?
29711,Rebekah, I want to be human again
29712,Elijah," How do you know that being human is the answer you're looking for? I mean, it's nothing but a romantic notion. The grass won't necessarily be greener, Rebekah"
29713,Rebekah," You're probably right. But I don't care. I want to live a simple life as a normal person. And when it ends, it ends. We've had 20 lifetimes together, Elijah. Isn't that enough?"
29714,Elijah," I just don't understand. I mean, why must you always consider our family a burden? Always and forever. I mean, those words are as important to me today as they ever were"
29715,Rebekah," You will always be my brother. And I will never stop loving you. But now it's time for me to live and die the way that I choose, not the way you and Nik want me to. Please. Please just give me the cure"
29716,Rebekah," What do you want, Nik?"
29717,Klaus, An update on our search for the elusive cure
29718,Rebekah," Let's just say that things have gotten complicated. In fact, why don't you speak to one of those complications? Here"
29719,Elijah, Complication speaking
29720,Klaus, Big brother. At last you join the fray
29721,Elijah," Somebody had to take charge. And now that I have, I've got the cure and I'm bringing it back to Mystic Falls"
29722,Klaus," With a long list of demands, I assume"
29723,Elijah, Not that long
29724,Klaus," Come home, brother. We'll settle this like family"
29725,Caroline, I used all your bleach
29726,Klaus, Thank you for helping me
29727,Caroline," Yeah. Well, if you need anything else... don't call me. I have a prom to plan"
29728,Klaus, Friends then?
29729,Caroline, Are you gonna let Tyler come back into town?
29730,Klaus," You might have noticed... I'm not exactly scouring the earth for him, am I?"
29731,Damon," All right. You're right. I let Rebekah take the cure. I thought for a second… I mean, literally just a second… if Rebekah takes this, then all my problems go away. And I couldn't think of one good reason to give it to Elena. And then Rebekah took it. And I realized how badly I screwed up"
29732,Stefan," So what's your point, Damon?"
29733,Damon," My point is, I'm sorry, ok? I had a moment of weakness, Stefan. It's my thing. It's like you and I falling for the same girl. It's our thing"
29734,Stefan," Was our thing. Look, we've been making the same mistakes for 150 years. We can judge Katherine all we want, but we keep repeating our own history just like she is. Nothing ever changes. It has to stop, Damon"
29735,Damon, What are you talking about?
29736,Stefan," I'm done. I can't keep reliving my life like this. I owe Elena her sh*t at being normal again. Once we give her the cure, I'm getting her out of my life and I'm getting a life of my own"
29737,Damon," Okay. Okay, let's just...get the cure and then we'll talk about you riding off into the sunset all by you lonesome"
29738,Stefan, You still want to get the cure. Even if that means you might lose her
29739,Damon," It's a chance I'm willing to take, Stefan"
29740,Stefan, Guess all we have to do is convince her
29741,Waitress, Sit anywhere you like
29742,Stefan, Are you all right?
29743,Damon," What's up with the silent treatment? You are the one that texted us, wanted to meet up"
29744,Elena, You know I don't want the cure. You need to know that I never will and I'm done talking about it. So... Will you accept that? And let me be who I am or not?
29745,Damon," Yeah, no"
29746,Stefan," Elena, this isn't you"
29747,Elena," It is now. And you two really need to accept it. 'Cause if you don't, there will be consequences"
29748,Stefan," Listen, I was in the exact same situation that you are in right now. My emotions were off, I wasn't me. And you refused to accept that. You didn't give up on me. You didn't stop until you pulled me back"
29749,Waitress, Let me just top that up for you
29750,Elena, Thanks
29751,Damon, Oh…!
29752,Elena," Like I said, consequences. That's one body you are responsible for. If you keep trying to fix me, there'll be a second, a twentieth, and a hundred. It's your choice"
29753,Damon, Still want to ride off into the sunset?
29754,Bonnie," Hey, Jeremy. You know, I was... I was thinking about the last thing I said to you. ""We did it."" Totally lame last thing to say to someone. That wasn't a goodbye, Jeremy. You… You were supposed to come back with us"
29755,Jeremy, Bonnie
29756,Bonnie, Jeremy
29757,Jeremy, Wake up
29758,Bonnie, How are you here?
29759,Jeremy," Bonnie, wake up"
29760,Bonnie, I don't understand
29761,Jeremy," Open your eyes. Bonnie, open your eyes!"
29762,Bonnie, Oh my god!
29763,Damon," So what has it been, 8, 9 days?"
29764,Stefan, About 8 or 9 days. I don't know. I lost count
29765,Damon," We lost count of the consecutive days in which Elena Gilbert has not k*ll anyone. I'd say that's progress, brother"
29766,Stefan," So, what are we gonna do, just throw the football around for another 150 years till Elena gets her humanity back? Because I'm cool with that"
29767,Damon, She doesn't want the cure. She's gonna start k*ll people if she knows we're still trying to get it for her
29768,Stefan," All right. We could always, uh, make her want it"
29769,Damon, Yeah. How are you gonna make an emotionless vampire want anything?
29770,Stefan, Get her to flip her humanity switch
29771,Damon," So, what are we gonna do? Pull a Lexi; b*mb her with emotions till one of them sticks?"
29772,Stefan," Yeah, and if that doesn't work, Then we go to plan ""B""… Lock her up and keep her sidelined until you and I figure out a plan ""C."""
29773,Damon, And what happens when she gets slammed with every emotion she's repressed since Jeremy died?
29774,Stefan," Well, then you, my friend, will be right by her side ready to help her through it"
29775,Damon," Right, because you don't want to keep reliving history. And when this is all over, you're just gonna get out of her life"
29776,Stefan, Bingo
29777,Damon, All right. How do you want to do this?
29778,Rebekah," Elijah, being human means a fresh start. I can grow old and have a family and fill my days with meaning, knowing that each one matters"
29779,Klaus," Well, that was poetic"
29780,Elijah," Well, if you can provide us with a more compelling reason for wanting the cure, Klaus, please"
29781,Klaus," Silas can appear as anyone. He got inside my thoughts, convinced me I was dying. He will torment me until I give him the cure"
29782,Rebekah," And in doing so, he will break down the wall to the other side"
29783,Klaus," So it doesn't trap him there when he dies. He wants to reunite with his lost soul mate. You, of all lovesick fools, should applaud his devotion"
29784,Rebekah, He will open the floodgates for every supernatural being that has ever died
29785,Klaus, Including our dear brothers Kol and Finn. We'll have our family back
29786,Rebekah, Please! You hated Kol. And you kept Finn in a box for most of his life
29787,Klaus," Elijah, please"
29788,Elijah," Your personal discomfort might not be sufficient reason for putting the entire world in jeopardy, Klaus. I think our sister deserves a sh*t at happiness"
29789,Klaus, Tell me you're joking. Tell me you're not fating me to an eternity of torture
29790,Elijah, I've made my decision
29791,Klaus," When you're sick and dying and you beg for my bl*od, I will laugh in your face and compel you to forget me"
29792,Rebekah, Where's the cure?
29793,Elijah," Rebekah, it's no secret that you are impulsive, emotional, and at times morally questionable. Prove to me this isn't just another one of your whims, that you know precisely what you are giving up here"
29794,Rebekah, Fine. Anything
29795,Elijah," I want you to live a day as a human. This day. No vampire privileges… no strength, no compulsion, no nothing. If you succeed and still believe this is what you want... the cure is yours"
29796,Elena," You're gonna fail. You should be locking yourself inside all day, not shopping for prom"
29797,Rebekah, Name me a more human experience than senior prom
29798,Elena, Death
29799,Rebekah, Why should I listen to you? You don't even have your humanity
29800,Elena," You realize you won't even be able to compel yourself a date, right?"
29801,Rebekah," Yes, and last time I checked, you're living in my house because I'm the only one that can tolerate you, so you don't have to be so rude"
29802,Elena," Then I'm going to come with you. Yeah. I'll keep an eye on you and make sure that you pass Elijah's test. As soon as you down the cure, it'll be gone for good. And no one will be able to use it on me"
29803,Caroline, What kind of dreams?
29804,Bonnie," Usually I'm at his grave, and... all of a sudden, he appears to me"
29805,Caroline," Well, you never got to say good-bye, Bon. You're grieving. That's normal"
29806,Bonnie," When I woke up, the couch was on fire. I don't know if it's because I was emotional in my dream or if Shane was right. Without his help, I'll lose control of my magic"
29807,Caroline, No. It's because you need a night off from mourning. And I'm gonna make sure that you have it
29808,Bonnie," Um, you look super-hot, by the way"
29809,Caroline, Do you think?
29810,Bonnie, Oh yeah
29811,Caroline, Yeah?
29812,Bonnie, Yeah. Matt and I are gonna have the sexiest date there
29813,Caroline," You know what? I love friend prom. And it's exactly what prom should be… friends and memories. Yes, it sucks that my boyfriend can't be here, but the three of us are gonna have the night of our lives"
29814,Elena," Hey, Bonnie. Heard you got your mind wiped. That sucks. Pretty dress, Caroline"
29815,Caroline," I know. You helped me pick it out months ago when we were friends, before you tried to k*ll me"
29816,Elena, I thought it looked familiar
29817,Caroline, Can you press this for me? I'll pick it up later. Bonnie
29818,Elena, I don't need a babysitter
29819,Stefan," Really? Because the last time I saw you, you snapped a waitress' spine"
29820,Elena," It got you to stop your search for the cure, didn't it?"
29821,Damon, Yup. We're just here to make sure you hold up your end of the deal. Don't eat the prom queen
29822,Damon, May I?
29823,Elena, No
29824,Damon, Wow. Would you look at that? Beautiful dress
29825,Elena, Thank you. I stole it
29826,Caroline, Klaus! Klaus!
29827,Caroline, Hello. Did you not hear me?
29828,Klaus," Of course I heard you, Caroline. I think the whole of Mystic Falls heard you. I'm in no mood for company"
29829,Caroline," Well, I'm sorry that you're having personal issues, but I have a real crisis on my hands. Elena stole my prom dress. I went to pick it up, and the tailor said that somebody else already did. And when I asked who, she said she couldn't remember. Hello? The vervain is out of the town water supply. She was compelled. It’s not funny"
29830,Klaus," I know, I know"
29831,Caroline," Then, stop laughing. Look, I know that prom isn't important to you, but it's important to me"
29832,Klaus, Surely finding another dress is well within your substantial vampire capabilities
29833,Caroline," But I don't want just another dress. I want to look hot, like princess Grace of Monaco hot. So... Could you please go back into your creepy trophy case of family collectibles and dig me out something of royal caliber?"
29834,Damon, Where's the disco ball?
29835,Stefan," Caroline's been working on this for a while. It's a, uh, photo yearbook of the senior class. Isn't that photo from first day of freshman year?"
29836,Elena, My mom took that when she dropped us off at school. I'm gonna get a seizure if I keep staring at these screens
29837,Matt, Why do I feel like we're at a practice run of Caroline's wedding?
29838,Bonnie, Because I think we are
29839,Damon, You are underage
29840,Elena," You're overage, and honestly, it's kind of creepy"
29841,Damon," Oh, come on. What bad-ass senior is complete without a prom date that's slightly too old for high school?"
29842,Elena, Please don't refer to yourself as my date
29843,Damon," Oh, I'm sorry. Your boyfriend. Something I said?"
29844,Elena, I'm not doing this
29845,Damon," You're not gonna deny that I'm your boyfriend, now, are you?"
29846,Elena," What are you doing? Trying to stir some feelings in me? Ironic, since you, my sire, are the one who had me turn them off"
29847,Damon," Yeah, well, hindsight is almost a bigger bitch than you"
29848,Elena," You're nothing to me, Damon"
29849,Damon, Really? Then why tell me you're in love with me? Why tell me it's the most real thing you've ever felt in your life?
29850,Elena," I told you I loved you because I was sired to you, And now that I'm not, I know that none of it was real, But if you still think that it was, I mean, maybe you're the one who needs help with your emotions, not me"
29851,Elena, Uh-oh. Friend patrol
29852,Bonnie," Hey. I know we haven't really talked since... everything, but I just… I want to say that I miss you"
29853,Matt," Me, too, and we want to help you"
29854,Elena, What are you gonna do… get me a job at the grill?
29855,Matt, I don't want you to look back and realize you missed out on the best part of senior year
29856,Elena," Spare me, Matt. If you had the choice, you would have turned your emotions off the second that Vicki died"
29857,Bonnie," Hey, you shut it off because all you could feel were the horrible things happening to you. You still have friends who love you"
29858,Elena," I thought you were going to bring Jeremy back, but it turned out you were just a brainwashed crazy person so technically, you're a walking reminder, of all the horrible things that have happened to me"
29859,Bonnie, I need some air
29860,Matt," Bonnie, wait"
29861,Bonnie, Caroline's right. Elena's gone
29862,Bonnie, Is this real?
29863,Jeremy, Does it matter? May I have this dance?
29864,Elena, Let go of me or I will bite you
29865,Stefan," Oh, come on. I'm the one that hates to dance, remember?"
29866,Elena," Yeah, and now I finally see why"
29867,Rebekah," So are you and Bonnie, like, a thing?"
29868,Matt, We're not a thing. We're friends. So who are you here with?
29869,Rebekah, No one. Go on. I know what you're thinking… Why didn't I just compel myself a date?
29870,Matt," You know, actually I was thinking, I wonder if Bonnie wants ice"
29871,Rebekah, Oh. Could I ask you a question?
29872,Matt," Why? Apparently you already seem to know everything I'm thinking, so..."
29873,Rebekah, Do you think that I would make a good human?
29874,Matt," I think that ""good"" is a hard word to live up to. I've never seen you do anything remotely good, so... honestly, no, I don't. I’m sorry"
29875,Stefan," So you're just here to help Rebekah get the cure, right, on what happens to be the most sentimental night in high school"
29876,Elena, You think this is my cry for help? I'd be happy to show you what a real cry for help sounds like
29877,Stefan, So this... us… you feel nothing?
29878,Elena, I feel nothing
29879,Stefan, I don't believe you
29880,Elena, I don't care
29881,Stefan, So you don't remember what it used to feel like when we would dance? When my hand would touch your waist?
29882,Elena, Nope
29883,Stefan, How about this... When our fingers would touch?
29884,Elena, Nothing
29885,Stefan, And this? Does your heart really refuse to remember?
29886,Elena, What heart?
29887,Elena, So how do I look?
29888,Caroline, Are you kidding me? You look like a backstabbing bi…
29889,Caroline," The dress is beautiful, and it brings out your eyes"
29890,Elena, Thanks. I thought I'd do it a favor
29891,Stefan," Caroline, why don't you come dance with me?"
29892,Caroline," I know you said to k*ll her with kindness, but can't I just k*ll her?"
29893,Stefan, I see you found a dress
29894,Caroline, It's from Klaus. Don't ask
29895,Stefan," You know you have him wrapped around your little finger, right?"
29896,Caroline," If I had Klaus wrapped around my finger, then I would be here with Tyler right now. Are you making any progress with the dress thief?"
29897,Stefan, I don't know. I think it's affecting me a lot more than it's affecting her
29898,Caroline, What do you mean?
29899,Stefan," Every time I tell myself that I'm moving on, there's this part of me that just can't seem to shake her"
29900,Caroline," That's normal, Stefan. You guys were in love. That doesn't go away just because you declare that you're moving on"
29901,Stefan, Then how does anyone ever seem to move on?
29902,Caroline," I don't know. I think that someday, you'll meet someone new and you'll fall madly in love. and you'll have moved on without even realizing it"
29903,April, I can't just make you prom queen. It is based on votes. And you have approximately none so far
29904,Rebekah, And you can't just help out a friend?
29905,April," No, I can't. And you can't make me. I drink vervain tea now"
29906,Rebekah, I was not going to compel you
29907,Elena," You can't be compelled, but you can be k*ll. Rebekah wins prom queen. Got it?"
29908,Rebekah, What the bloody hell are you doing?
29909,Elena, What you were about to do
29910,Rebekah, I was not going to threaten her
29911,Elena, Remember that time you tortured me until I told you how to find the cure? You ruined my relationship with Stefan and then you trapped us with a werewolf?
29912,Rebekah, Yeah. So?
29913,Elena," So you're not a good person. You're not gonna win this cure by being yourself. So just stand there and refrain from talking, ok?"
29914,Bonnie, You and me. We're at senior prom
29915,Jeremy," Do you miss me, Bonnie?"
29916,Bonnie, Of course I do
29917,Jeremy, Do you want this to be real?
29918,Bonnie, Yes
29919,Jeremy, Then it can be. Bonnie... Your magic can bring me back for good. You have the power to do the spell now
29920,Bonnie," Oh, my god. You're Silas. Get away from me"
29921,Jeremy/Silas," You need me, Bonnie"
29922,Bonnie, I don't need you. I don't want anything to do with you
29923,Jeremy/Silas," You have no idea how dangerous you are. If I don't help you, you'll k*ll yourself"
29924,Bonnie, You're trying to get in my head.
29925,Jeremy/Silas, I'm just asking for your help in return for mine
29926,Bonnie, Leave me alone
29927,Jeremy/Silas, Wake up on fire recently?
29928,Bonnie, Did you do that to me?
29929,Jeremy/Silas," Please, Bonnie, let me help before you hurt somebody or yourself"
29930,Bonnie," You don't care about me. You only care about bringing down the wall to the other side, and I won't do it"
29931,Jeremy/Silas, Don't you want to see Jeremy again?
29932,Bonnie, Not like this
29933,Klaus, Where did you get that?
29934,Elijah, Our baby sister. Once she's human... it'll make no difference to her whatsoever. Take it
29935,Klaus, Why would you give me this?
29936,Elijah," We are immortal apart from the stake. Now that it's yours, you have nothing to fear"
29937,Klaus, Silas will continue to torment me
29938,Elijah," You've survived endless torments throughout the centuries. You'll shake this. And if you can't, you outrun him"
29939,Klaus," Yes, it's that simple. Without the cure, what makes you think I'll spare your beloved Katerina? Or have you figured out, you're simply another spider in her web?"
29940,Elijah," You will spare her because I am asking you to spare her. As your family, as your only living brother, I would ask that you provide me with this opportunity to feel, to care, to love"
29941,Klaus," I gave you that opportunity, and you sided against me. So if I run, it will be to chase her. And as your only living brother, I will make it my cause that you never know a moment of happiness"
29942,Elijah," It is such a hollow little life that you lead, Niklaus"
29943,Matt," You haven't seen bonnie, have you?"
29944,Rebekah," She's probably in the bathroom. Every other girl is. And if you haven't noticed, I am sitting here all on my own. So, please, will you put me out of my misery and dance with me?"
29945,Matt, I don't think so
29946,Rebekah," Matt, please. This is a girl's worst nightmare. Please. I thought about what you said... about being good and you're right. It won't be easy, but it's worth trying"
29947,Matt, I don't understand why my opinion is so important to you
29948,Rebekah," Because you're everything that I want to be. You're loyal, honest, kind. People root for you to succeed. Elena even died for you"
29949,Matt," I'm a bus boy, Rebekah. It's not like i'm out saving the world"
29950,Rebekah, But you're human. You're so beautifully human
29951,Caroline," Aren't you on ""Save Elena"" Duty?"
29952,Damon, I'm taking a little breather
29953,Caroline," This prom sucks. This is our last dance together, and it's awful. This is not how I wanted to remember this night"
29954,Caroline," Thank you. Well, if anyone asks, I'll be at the after-party"
29955,Bonnie, We have a problem
29956,Bonnie," It's like Jeremy was there. I could talk to him, feel him"
29957,Stefan," Bonnie, that's what Silas does. You can't let him get to you again"
29958,Damon," Yeah, because you all crazy and brainwashed. It's not a good look"
29959,Rebekah, What am I missing?
29960,Elena, Silas is appearing to Bonnie Silas is appearing to Bonnie which means he still wants her to do the spell
29961,Rebekah, So? The nice thing about having no feelings is you don't fear your enemies on the other side
29962,Elena, I'm not worried about my enemies. It's people like Alaric... and Jeremy. Salvatore brothers are annoying enough as it is. Can you imagine if my brother came back to the living? He'd spend every waking hour trying to get my humanity back
29963,April," Hey. Ok, the ballots have been tallied, Which means it's time to announce this year's prom king and queen"
29964,Stefan," Look, one of us should take her home"
29965,Damon, What? No. She's safer here in public around all these people. There's no way Silas can make everyone see the same thing all at once
29966,Matt," Ok, in the meantime, how do we look out for a guy that can appear as anyone?"
29967,April, All right. Your prom king and queen are... Matt Donovan and Bonnie Bennett
29968,Rebekah, Bonnie bloody Bennett. Of course
29969,Elena," Everyone's so worried about Silas, but there's an obvious solution to all of this. He needs Bonnie. He can't do the spell without her. So if you can't k*ll Silas, k*ll his witch"
29970,Rebekah, I can't k*ll anyone. I'm supposed to be human
29971,Elena," Maybe you can't, but I can"
29972,Caroline, Tyler
29973,Tyler, I don't think you've ever looked more beautiful
29974,Caroline," Oh, my god. Tyler. Oh, you can't be here. Klaus…"
29975,Tyler, Can't get in. Matt owns this place now. He had to invite me inside
29976,Caroline, If Klaus finds out...
29977,Tyler," He won’t. You didn't really think I was gonna miss prom, did you? Here. These are for you. Caroline Forbes, may I please have this dance?"
29978,Stefan, You looking for Silas or you waxing nostalgic about misspent youth?
29979,Damon, What happened to you being over it?
29980,Stefan, What do you mean?
29981,Damon," Well, I mean, for a guy who's ready to move on, you seemed pretty convincing as a boyfriend out on the dance floor"
29982,Stefan," I mean, isn't that what we're doing? Reminding Elena of what she's lost?"
29983,Damon, Like her feelings for you?
29984,Stefan," Yeah. Yeah, maybe. I mean, I don't mean to be a dick, Damon, but Elena and I have a history. Memories, laughs, ups and downs. It was a real relationship. I mean, what you have is just a one-night stand that was probably the result of the sire bond. Your mind is a very dark and riveting place, Damon"
29985,Damon," Uh! Silas. Where's my brother, you psychic freak?"
29986,Stefan," He's in the woods, where I convinced him I was you. He's probably in a bit of pain now, too. The witch is mine. Stay away from her"
29987,Rebekah, You need to get your queen off the stage
29988,Matt, I can't really do that right now
29989,Rebekah," You didn't hear it from me, but Elena's up to something"
29990,Elena," Congratulations, Bonnie"
29991,Bonnie, What do you want?
29992,Elena, For you to stop being a problem
29993,Matt, Bonnie
29994,Bonnie, Something's happening to me
29995,Matt," OK, just relax"
29996,Bonnie," No, I got to get out of here"
29997,April, What's going on?
29998,Elena, Remember when I told you to make Rebekah prom queen?
29999,Matt, No!
30000,Elena, You should have listened
30001,Matt," April, April, come on. Please wake up. April, come on!"
30002,Rebekah," Matt, why did you call... oh, my God"
30003,Matt," Rebekah, can you feed her your bl*od?"
30004,Rebekah, Can't we just call 911 or something?
30005,Matt, She's dying. Please help her
30006,Rebekah," I can't. If I heal her with my vampire bl*od, Elijah won't give me the cure and I won't get to be human"
30007,Matt, How is this even a choice right now? You want to be human? Prove it. Be good. Do the right thing and save her life
30008,Damon, Stefan
30009,Stefan, Yeah. I'm over here. Agh!
30010,Damon, Let me guess. An extremely handsome man came up to you claiming to be me
30011,Stefan, Yeah
30012,Damon, Yeah
30013,Jeremy/Silas," Bonnie, wait"
30014,Bonnie," Get away from me, Silas"
30015,Jeremy/Silas, We can help each other
30016,Bonnie, This is what you do. You wait until I lose control and then you want to swoop in and save me
30017,Jeremy/Silas," You really think you have a choice? If you don't let me help you, your expression will consume you from the inside out"
30018,Bonnie, Get away from me
30019,Jeremy/Silas," You didn't try to do that, did you? Your magic is taking on a life of its own. You need help controlling it. Listen to me, Bonnie. Breathe"
30020,Bonnie, I'll die before I let you control me again
30021,Jeremy/Silas," Bonnie, listen to me! Control, Bonnie! Control"
30022,Bonnie, Get out of my head!
30023,Stefan," Bonnie, stop. Bonnie"
30024,Elena," Damon, help me"
30025,Stefan, Bonnie… You’re k*ll her
30026,Bonnie, I know what I'm doing
30027,Stefan, That's the magic talking. This is your best friend.
30028,Damon," Damn it, Bonnie"
30029,Elena , Bonnie... Please. Please
30030,Stefan, You ok?
30031,Bonnie ,"No, I'm not ok. I almost died. The shell of my best friend almost k*ll me. None of this is ok"
30032,Damon, I got you
30033,Stefan," Ok. Hey. Plan ""B”"
30034,Matt, Thank you for saving her
30035,Rebekah, Elena was right. I should have just stayed home
30036,Matt, No one has to know what you did. I won't tell anyone
30037,Rebekah, You'd really do that for me?
30038,Matt, I would. And maybe I was a little harsh earlier. You wouldn't make the worst human
30039,Rebekah," Are you offering me a job as a bus boy? You know, I'd look cute in an apron"
30040,Matt, We'll see. I should probably get April home
30041,Matt, Try to stand up
30042,Klaus," Dear sweet April Young. Now, there's a girl with a future"
30043,Rebekah," She was dying, and I acted with human decency. You can't get more human than that"
30044,Klaus," Actually, you can. You can stand idly by as poor April takes her final breath. You can ask, ""Why does this always happen to innocent people?"" ""Where do the spirits go?"" ""Was there anything I could have done?"" That is what it means to be human, sister. You give humanity too much credit"
30045,Rebekah, Are you gonna tell Elijah?
30046,Klaus, No. No. You are
30047,Elijah, You're home. And how did our Cinderella fare?
30048,Rebekah, I won't lie. There were complications
30049,Klaus," You'll tell him that you cheated, that you failed, that you don't deserve the cure"
30050,Rebekah, But I passed your test with flying colors
30051,Elijah, If this is what you truly want... It's yours
30052,Rebekah, Why is it so hard for you to let me be happy?
30053,Klaus, Because your happiness comes at the expense of my sanity. Because I refuse to entertain yet another one of your whims. Because you are bored and you're looking for a reason to matter. Thankfully I don't have to waste any more breath fighting you on the subject
30054,Rebekah," What does that mean? Nik, what does that mean?"
30055,Rebekah, I guess it's time that I turned into a pumpkin. Thank you Elijah
30056,Elijah, Rebekah?
30057,Rebekah," Elijah, I think Nik's up to something"
30058,Elijah, Where did you go?
30059,Rebekah," I'm still at the prom. Look, don't do anything with the cure until I see you. Something's not right. Elijah? Hello? Elijah, do not take your eyes off that cure"
30060,Elijah, I think it might be a little late for that
30061,Tyler," I have to go soon. People will be here for the party, and if anyone sees me..."
30062,Caroline, I know. I know. Thank you for the best prom ever
30063,Klaus," Was it worth it to see her smile, to make her dream night come true? Was it worth it? In the shared interest of giving Caroline the night of her dreams... I'm going to allow you 5 seconds before I rip your heart of your chest. 5, 4, 3..."
30064,Damon," She might not feel much, but she's gonna feel that in the morning"
30065,Stefan, So what's the plan?
30066,Damon," When Bonnie was whaling on her tonight, I could see it in her eyes. Elena thought she was gonna die. She was scared"
30067,Stefan, Fear
30068,Damon," Last time I checked, one of those pesky human emotions"
30069,Stefan, So plan C... make her life a living hell
30070,Damon," You care to talk about our other problem? You know, the one that can be anyone anywhere at anytime"
30071,Stefan," Silas still needs Bonnie. And if tonight is any indication, she's no pushover. She's not gonna let him manipulate her, not anymore"
30072,Damon, I wouldn't underestimate his talents. He fooled the hell out of both of us. What did he say to you anyway?
30073,Stefan," He led me out in the woods, claiming he saw Silas, and then he staked me. How did he get to you?"
30074,Damon, Talked about his hair. I figured it had to be you
30075,Stefan, funny
30076,Damon, You coming?
30077,Stefan, Yeah
30078,Katherine," Klaus, I hear Elijah has refused you the cure, and in return, you have refused me my freedom. Shame on you both. But while you boys sort out your problems, I have one last thing to offer you. I've caught wind that there is a witch in New Orleans named Jane-Anne Deveraux plotting a move against you. Hunt her down. What she has to say will rattle you so deeply to your core that chasing little old me will be the least of your concerns. It's been a fun five centuries, Klaus, but I've worn down too many good heels running from you. Love and hate, Katerina’’ "
30079,Bonnie, Silas? I know it's you. My locator spell worked without using any of your possessions
30080,Silas, Yes. You're finally acknowledging how powerful you are
30081,Bonnie, You're not Jeremy anymore. Is this the real you? Then tell me why you're hiding
30082,Silas," Call it Qetsiyah's revenge. When she learned that I didn't love her, she used her magic to ensure no woman could ever love me. It should come as no surprise that now I simply want to die"
30083,Bonnie, And I want you to
30084,Silas, Even if it means bringing back every dead supernatural being?
30085,Bonnie, Show me your face
30086,Damon, That's the calmest desiccating vampire I've ever seen. I remember when you starved me down there for 3 days. I would've wept at your feet for an orange peel
30087,Stefan," Look, she's not gonna beg for bl*od. Begging means desperation. Emotion. She's still in no-humanity zone"
30088,Damon, How hungry does she have to be before we can torture some feelings back into her?
30089,Stefan," A lot hungrier than she is now, apparently"
30090,Damon," So, what are we supposed to do in the meantime?"
30091,Katherine, Maybe I can provide a little excitement
30092,Stefan, Katherine
30093,Katherine," The one and only. Sort of. So, when's the welcome home party?"
30094,Damon," Wow. Look who went and got bold. Last time I checked, Klaus was plotting your eternal demise"
30095,Katherine," Well, it doesn't matter anymore, because Klaus is gone"
30096,Stefan, Wait. What do you mean he's gone?
30097,Katherine, Let's just say that werewolf girl Hayley turned out to be just the thing we needed to get Klaus out of our lives for good
30098,Bartender, Third time in here this week
30099,Haley," I'm obsessed with The Gumbo, Jane-Anne"
30100,Jane-Anne, The old ladies in the ninth ward say my sister Sophie bleeds a piece of her soul into every dish
30101,Haley, I asked around the quarter about my family
30102,Jane-Anne, And?
30103,Haley, Nothing. Zero. Can't find a single person who remembers them
30104,Jane-Anne," Because, Hayley, people like you were run out of here years ago"
30105,Haley," What do you mean, people like me?"
30106,Jane-Anne," In the Bayou, they call the werewolves Roux-Ga-Roux. You head out there; you'll find what you're looking for. Be careful. It's the last place you'd ever want to go"
30107,Sophie, Don't do it. Please. What if I’m wrong about her?
30108,Jane-Anne, That's the beauty of you. You're never wrong. She's the only way we're gonna get to Klaus
30109,Sophie, Can we get someone else to do the spell?
30110,Jane-Anne, Who? Half the witches don't believe you. The other half are too scared
30111,Sophie," Because they know we're gonna get caught, Jane-Anne"
30112,Jane-Anne, We don't have any other option. Now go. You know what you need to do
30113,Haley, What the... uhh! Are you kidding me?
30114,Haley," Hey, I'm looking for a tow service"
30115,Tour Guide," Welcome to the dark side of New Orleans, a supernatural playground where the living are easily lost and the dead stick around and play"
30116,Rebekah, New Orleans? What the hell is Klaus doing there?
30117,Elijah," Evidently, there are witches conspiring against him. So, knowing our brother, this was a mission to silence and slaughter"
30118,Rebekah," Well, the French quarter witches are not a lot to be trifled with. You don't suppose they've found a way to k*ll him once and for all, do you?"
30119,Elijah," Rebekah, in the name of our family, you might try to dial down your glee"
30120,Rebekah, What family? We are 3 distrustful acquaintances who happen to share a bloodline. I for one hope they've found a way to make that traitorous bastard rot
30121,Klaus, Good afternoon. Time for one more?
30122,Woman, I have nothing to say to you
30123,Klaus," Oh, now, that's not very amiable, is it? You don't even know me"
30124,Woman," I know what you are. Half-vampire, half-beast. You're the hybrid"
30125,Klaus," I'm the original hybrid, actually, but that's a long story for another time"
30126,Rebekah, Where are you going?
30127,Elijah," To find out who's making a move against our brother, and then... I'll either stop them, or I'll help them. Depending on my mood"
30128,Klaus, I'm looking for someone. A witch. Perhaps you might be able to help me find her. Jane-Anne Deveraux
30129,Woman, Sorry. I don't know
30130,Klaus," Well, now, that's a fib, isn't it? Now, you see... I know that you're a true witch amongst this sea of poseurs. So, enough with the fabrications. I've quite a temper"
30131,Woman, Witches don't talk Outta School in the quarter. The vampire won't allow it. Those are the rules. I don't break Marcel's rules
30132,Klaus, Marcel's rules? Where do you suppose I might find Marcel?
30133,Marcel, Klaus
30134,Klaus, Marcel
30135,Marcel, Must be 100 years since that nasty business with your papa
30136,Klaus, Has it been that long?
30137,Marcel," Way I recall it, he ran you out of town. Left a trail of dead vampires in his wake"
30138,Klaus," And yet how fortunate you managed to survive. My father, I'm afraid, I recently incinerated to dust"
30139,Marcel," Well, if I'd known you were coming back in town, if I had a heads-up..."
30140,Klaus," What, Marcel? What would you have done?"
30141,Marcel," I'd have thrown you a damn parade. Niklaus Mikaelson. My mentor, my savior, my sire. Let's get you a drink. It is good to see you"
30142,Klaus, It's good to be home. Although please tell me the current state of bourbon street is not your doing
30143,Marcel," Ha ha ha ha! Something's gotta draw in the out-of-towners; otherwise, we'd all go hungry"
30144,Klaus, I see your friends are daywalkers
30145,Marcel," Yeah, yeah, I shared the secret of your daylight ring with a few buddies. Just the inner circle, though. The family"
30146,Klaus, Tell me. How did you find a witch willing to make daylight rings?
30147,Marcel, I got the witches here wrapped around my finger
30148,Klaus, Is that so? I'm looking for a witch by the name of Jane-Anne Deveraux. Has some business with me
30149,Marcel, Looking for Jane-Anne? Then you probably ought to come with me. Ha ha! Showtime!
30150,Marcel, How's the family?
30151,Klaus, Those who live hate me more than ever
30152,Marcel," Forget them. If your bl*od relations let you down, you make your own, huh? You taught me that. And what's mine is yours, as always. Even my nightwalkers, the riff-raff"
30153,Klaus," They're hardly subtle, are they?"
30154,Marcel," It's the quarter. Ain't no such thing as subtle, baby"
30155,Marcel," Jane-Anne Deveraux. Give it up for Jane-Anne. Come on. Jane-Anne Deveraux, you have been accused of the practice of witchcraft beyond the bounds of the rules set forth and enforced by me. How do you plead? Oh. Was that convincing? I studied law back in the fifties. It's all I know. Seriously, J, tick tock. You know the drill. How do you plead?"
30156,Jane-Anne, I didn't do anything
30157,Marcel," That's a lie. You know it, I know it, and you hate that I know it. It drives you witches crazy that I'm aware of your every move. That you can't do magic in this town without getting caught. So, why don't we just cut to the chase, huh? You tell me what magic you're brewing. Tell me. I'll grant you leniency. Hey, I am, after all, a merciful man"
30158,Jane-Anne," Rot in hell, monster"
30159,Marcel, I'll tell you what. I'll give you one more chance. Or not
30160,Klaus, What was that?
30161,Marcel, Hey. Come walk with me. Witches aren't allowed to do magic here. She broke the rules
30162,Klaus, I told you I wanted to talk to her
30163,Marcel," Hey, I'm sorry. I got caught up in the show. Those witches, they think that they still have power in this town. I have to show them that they don't. I never waste an opportunity for a show of force. Another lesson that I learned from you. And besides, anything that you could've gotten out of her, I can find out for you, and I will. I promise"
30164,Klaus," Well, whatever it was, doesn't matter anymore, does it?"
30165,Marcel," Good. Then let's eat, because all that spilled bl*od makes me hungry"
30166,Klaus," Hey. Thierry, isn't it? Any more Deveraux witches where she came from?"
30167,Sophie, You're Klaus
30168,Klaus," I am. And you're upset. Sophie, isn't it? I assume this is because of what I just witnessed with your sister on the corner of Royal and St. Ann"
30169,Sophie, Did you enjoy the show?
30170,Klaus, It was a little melodramatic for my tastes. What did your sister want with me? Why did Marcel k*ll her?
30171,Sophie, I see you brought friends
30172,Klaus, They're not with me
30173,Sophie," They're with Marcel. That's all that matters. I know you built this town, but this is his town now. He k*ll my sister because she broke the rules. So, I talk to you in front of them, I'm next"
30174,Klaus, Are you two gentlemen following me?
30175,Man, Marcel said we're your guides
30176,Klaus," Oh, he did, did he? Well, then, let me be exceedingly clear about something. If either of you following me again, you'll do so without the benefit of a spine"
30177,Camille," Sorry for the wait. If you're here for the gumbo, I'm about to break your heart. We just ran out"
30178,Klaus," Your oldest scotch for my two friends here, love. Marcel wants to know what I'm up to, he can ask me himself"
30179,Sophie," The doors work, you know"
30180,Man, You doing magic?
30181,Sophie, I'm praying to my dead sister. Go ahead. Pay your respects
30182,Man,". Don't make this a thing, Sophie. The hybrid was looking for Jane-Anne. Marcel wants to know why"
30183,Sophie," Oh, that sounds like witch business. I'd say ask her yourself, but I guess you can't seeing as how Marcel k*ll her"
30184,Elijah, I’m Elijah. You've heard of me?
30185,Sophie, Yes
30186,Elijah," So, why don't you tell me what business your family has with my brother?"
30187,Klaus, Where's Marcel?
30188,Man, Who the hell's asking?
30189,Klaus, I assume you're joking
30190,Man, I only answer to Marcel
30191,Klaus," Well, then, in that case, perhaps you'll answer to this. You're aware the bite of a werewolf can k*ll a vampire? Well, as you can see, I'm half-werewolf, so I'm gonna ask you one more time! Where is Marcel?"
30192,Marcel," H-hey. I'm right here. I'm right here. Easy, now. Diego's just looking out for me. Nobody harms my"
30193,Klaus," I don't care about your rules, Marcel. I don't need chaperones. Why are you having me followed?"
30194,Marcel," Come here. I get it, huh? Show of force. You made your point. Let it go, friend. For me"
30195,Klaus, Fine. Why don't you show me what you've done with the place while you explain exactly what it is you've been up to in my town?
30196,Marcel, Follow me
30197,Marcel," Look at that skyline. That there, that's progress. More hotels, more tourists, more fresh bl*od. And the humans? I taught them to look the other way"
30198,Klaus," And what of the witches? In my time, they were a force to be reckoned with, and now they live in fear. How do you know when they're using magic?"
30199,Marcel," Maybe I got a secret w*apon, an ace up my sleeve, something that gives me complete control over all the magic in this town"
30200,Klaus, Hmm. Is that a fact?
30201,Marcel, Might be. Or maybe I'm just bluffing
30202,Klaus, You take vervain?
30203,Marcel," 'Burns like a bitch. But I figure I should limit the number of things I'm vulnerable to. Don't be mad about that chaperone thing. I told my guys to look out for you, that's all. That's what we do here... Look out for each other"
30204,Marcel, Mmmmm. New bl*od
30205,Klaus," The bartender, walking alone at night. She's either brave or dumb"
30206,Marcel," Let's see. Brave, I let her live, Let's see. Brave, I let her live, dumb, she's dessert"
30207,Marcel," You know, it's not safe here alone"
30208,Camille," You know, I have a black belt in karate"
30209,Klaus," Evening, Elijah"
30210,Elijah, Niklaus
30211,Klaus, What an entirely unwelcome surprise
30212,Elijah, And what an entirely unsurprising welcome. Come with me
30213,Klaus, I'm not going anywhere. Not until I find out who's conspiring against me
30214,Elijah, I believe I just found that out for you
30215,Klaus, What are we doing here?
30216,Elijah, Want to know what the witches have in store for you? Follow me
30217,Klaus, Sophie Deveraux. What is this?
30218,Elijah, He's all yours. Proceed
30219,Sophie, You know you're famous in this town? Witches tell bedtime stories about the powerful vampire Klaus. We know Marcel was nothing but an orphaned street rat until you made him what he is. And now he's out of control. He does what he wants. He k*ll who he wants. I'm gonna stop him... And you're gonna help me
30220,Klaus, This is why you brought me here
30221,Elijah, Hear her out
30222,Klaus," I don't need to hear her out. I assure you, love, there is not a thing on this earth that will matter enough for me to waste even 30 more seconds of my time"
30223,Klaus," Elijah, what madness is this?"
30224,Haley, Klaus… You need to listen to them
30225,Klaus," You're all out of your minds if you think some liquor-fueled one-night stand... No offense, sweetheart... Means a thing to me"
30226,Sophie," Marcel may be able to keep us from practicing real magic in this town, but as keepers of the balance, we still know when nature has cooked up something new. For example, I have a special gift, of sensing when a girl is pregnant"
30227,Klaus, What?
30228,Haley, I know. It's impossible
30229,Klaus, What are you saying?
30230,Elijah, Niklaus… The girl is carrying your child
30231,Klaus, No. It's impossible. Vampires cannot procreate
30232,Sophie," But werewolves can. Magic made you a vampire, but you were born a werewolf. You're the original hybrid, the first of your kind, and this pregnancy is one of nature's loopholes"
30233,Klaus, You've been with someone else. Admit it!
30234,Haley, Hey. I spent days held captive in a freakin' alligator bayou because they think that I'm carrying some magical miracle baby. Don't you think I would've fessed up if it wasn't yours?
30235,Sophie," My sister gave her life to perform the spell she needed to confirm this pregnancy. Because of Jane-Anne's sacrifice, the lives of this girl and her baby are now controlled by us. If you don't help us take down Marcel, so help me, Hayley won't live long enough to see her first maternity dress"
30236,Haley," Wait, what?"
30237,Elijah," Enough of this, if you want Marcel dead, he's dead. I'll do it myself"
30238,Sophie, No. We can't. Not yet. We have a clear plan that we need to follow and there are rules
30239,Klaus, How dare you command me? Threaten me with what you wrongfully perceive to be my weaknesses? I won't hear any more lies
30240,Elijah, Niklaus. Listen
30241,Klaus, k*ll her and the baby. What do I care?
30242,Elijah, Niklaus
30243,Klaus," it's a trick, Elijah"
30244,Elijah," No, brother. It's a gift. It's your chance. It's our chance"
30245,Klaus, To what?
30246,Elijah," To start over. Take back everything we lost. Everything that was taken from us. Niklaus, our own parents came to despise us. Our family was ruined, we were ruined, and since then, all that you have ever wanted, all that we have ever wanted, was a family"
30247,Klaus, I will not be manipulated
30248,Elijah," So, they're manipulating you. So what? With them, this girl and her child, your child... live"
30249,Klaus, I'm gonna k*ll every last one of them
30250,Elijah," And then what? Then you return to Mystic Fall to resume your life as the hated one, as the evil hybrid? Is it so important to you that people quake with fear at the sound of your name?"
30251,Klaus, People quake with fear because I have the power to make them afraid. What will this child offer me? Will it guarantee me power?
30252,Elijah," Family is power, Niklaus. Love, loyalty. It's power. This is what we swore to one another a thousand years ago, before life tore away what little humanity you had left, before ego, before anger, before paranoia created this person before me... Someone I can barely even recognize as my own brother. This is us. The Original family. We remain together, always and forever. I am asking you to stay here. I will help you and I will stand by you. I will be your brother. We will build a home here together. So, save this girl Save your child"
30253,Klaus, No
30254,Elijah," He's doing what he does. Given a chance at happiness, Klaus runs in the opposite direction"
30255,Rebekah," Then let him run. That child, if it's even his, is better off without him"
30256,Elijah," He's not better off without that child, Rebekah, and neither are we"
30257,Rebekah," Darling, kind Elijah. Our brother rarely brings us anything but pain. At what point in your immortal life will you stop searching for his redemption?"
30258,Elijah, I'll stop searching for his redemption when I believe there is none left to be found
30259,Rebekah," I'd give you a play-by-play, but you have the air of someone who's been lurking and listening"
30260,Katherine, He'll come around. You know Elijah. He won't stop until he's convinced Klaus to do the right thing
30261,Rebekah," I know you consider yourself an expert in brotherly dynamics, but you don't know my brothers half as well as you think you do"
30262,Katherine," You're wrong. Klaus won't be able to walk away from this. He and I are the same. We manipulate, we thirst for power, we control, we punish, but our actions are driven by one singular place deep inside"
30263,Rebekah, And what's that?
30264,Katherine, We're alone. And we hate it. Tell Elijah to call me when he comes home. I’ll be waiting for him
30265,Marcel," Hey, man. Where'd you run off to?"
30266,Klaus, You mean your minions aren't still documenting my every move?
30267,Marcel, Someone put you in a mood. What can I do?
30268,Klaus, What you can do is you can tell me what this thing is you have with the witches
30269,Marcel, We’re back to that?
30270,Klaus," Yeah, we’re back to that"
30271,Marcel," You know I owe you everything I got, but I'm afraid I have to draw the line on this one. This is my business. I control the witches in my town. Let's just leave it at that"
30272,Klaus, Your town?
30273,Marcel, Damn straight
30274,Klaus," That's funny. Because when I left 100 years ago, you were just a pathetic little scrapper still trembling from the lashes of the whips of those who would keep you down, and now look at you. Master of your domain. Prince of the city. I'd like to know how"
30275,Marcel," Why? Jealous? Hey man, I get it. 300 years ago, you helped build a backwater penal colony into something. You started it, but then you left. Actually, you ran from it. I saw it through. Look around. Vampires rule this city now. We don't have to live in the shadows like rats. The locals know their place. They look the other way. I got rid of the werewolves. I even found a way to shut down the witches. The bl*od never stops flowing and the party never ends. You want to pass on through? You want to stay a while? Great. What's mine is yours, but it is mine. My home, my family, my rules"
30276,Klaus, And if someone breaks those rules?
30277,Marcel," They die. Mercy is for the weak. You taught me that, too. And I'm not the Prince of the quarter, friend. I'm the King! Show me some respect"
30278,Klaus," Your friend will be dead by the weekend. Which means I've broken one of your rules. And yet I cannot be k*ll. I am immortal. Who has the power now, friend?"
30279,Camille, The hundred dollar guy
30280,Klaus, The brave bartender. Camille. That's a French name
30281,Camille," It's a grandma's name. Call me Cami. Amazing, isn't he?"
30282,Klaus, Do you paint?
30283,Camille," No, but I admire. Every artist has a story, you know"
30284,Klaus, And what do you suppose his story is?
30285,Camille," He's... angry. Dark. Doesn't feel safe and doesn't know what to do about it. He wishes he could control his demons instead of having his demons control him. He’s lost, alone. Or... maybe he just drank too much tonight. Sorry. Overzealous psych major"
30286,Klaus, No. I think you were probably right the first time
30287,Camille, So…
30288,Klaus, Are you here to give me another pep talk on the joys of fatherhood?
30289,Elijah, I've said all I needed to say
30290,Klaus, I forgot how much I liked this town
30291,Elijah, I didn't forget. All the centuries we've spent together and yet I can count on one hand the number of times that our family has been truly happy. I hated leaving here
30292,Klaus, As did I
30293,Elijah," What is on your mind, brother?"
30294,Klaus," For a thousand years, I lived in fear. Any time I settled anywhere, our father would hunt me down and... chase me off. He made me feel powerless, and I hated it. This town was my home once, and in my absence, Marcel has gotten everything that I ever wanted. Power, loyalty, family. I made him in my image and he has bettered me. I want what he has. I want to be King"
30295,Elijah, And what of Hayley and the baby?
30296,Klaus, Every King needs an heir
30297,Elijah," So, how do you propose this will work?"
30298,Sophie," Your brother needs to cement his place in Marcel's world. His inner circle, the daywalkers... That's where we begin. They're his friends. His family. We'll be hitting him where it hurts"
30299,Klaus," I had time to sleep on it last night. I'm not your enemy. Where my family and I failed this town... Marcel succeeded. My bl*od will heal him. As though it never happened. The quarter is your home, but I would like to stay a while, if I'm still welcome"
30300,Klaus," Caroline. I'm standing in one of my favorite places in the world, surrounded by food, music, art, culture, and all I can think about is how much I want to show it to you. Maybe one day you'll let me"
30301,Rebekah," So, that's it? I'm just supposed to pack up my things and leave for good? Forget my life here and my pursuit of the cure?"
30302,Elijah," The cure was a fool's errand. I mean, taking it would've stripped you of everything you are for what? More High School proms?"
30303,Rebekah, I wanted to be human. I wanted children and a family
30304,Elijah, And I stand before you to offer you both
30305,Rebekah, And if I decide against you? A dagger in my heart and then back in a box?
30306,Elijah, I’ve made my case. Your family needs you. And what choice you make right now is your own
30307,Rebekah," I owe him nothing. I wish him no joy. No love. I will stay here and live my life the way I want to, and if you're smart, I suggest you do the same"
30308,Katherine," She's right. Be smart, Elijah. Klaus is stark raving mad, not to mention completely irredeemable. Leave him to set off on this new adventure and lets you and I go out on ours. I have lost so much of my life to Klaus. So have you. It's our turn. Elijah, please"
30309,Elijah, Katerina… Good bye
30310,Damon, You look terrible
30311,Elena, I'm hungry. Not that you care
30312,Damon, But I do. That's the whole point. I do care. You don't care. It's about time for that to change
30313,Elena, Vervain
30314,Damon, How does that make you feel? Hurt because I'd betray you? Angry because I'd cause you pain? Or scared? Because you know it's gonna get a lot worse?
30315,Elena, You boys want to play games? Go ahead. Let's see who breaks first. Me… or you
30316,Caroline," Elena, you're here. Hey, I got valedictorian. You can help me write my speech"
30317,Elena, Pass
30318,Caroline," Oh, come on. We're graduating this year. This is it. We're gonna have to soak up every second before..."
30319,Elena, Wait. Something is not right. I don't want to be here
30320,Damon," What is wrong with you? Don't you want to be with your friends, graduation parties, caps, gowns? You know the drill"
30321,Elena," What is this? We're not really here, are we? We're in my head"
30322,Damon, Relax. I just want to show you all the things you've been missing out on since you took the giant leap over the cuckoo's nest
30323,Elena, Last thing I remember...
30324,Damon," Let me guess. Prom... Beautiful dress, gorgeous hair, you trying to m*rder Bonnie. It's a good thing I was there to take care of you"
30325,Elena," You starved me, you and Stefan"
30326,Damon," Yeah. Well, we had to keep you weak so I could bring you here. See, the way I figure it is, if I can make you nostalgic, then you're already halfway to getting your humanity back"
30327,Elena," It's not gonna work, Damon"
30328,Damon," Well, there are other ways to provoke an emotional response"
30329,Stefan," You still have her locked in the safe? You've been in her head for an hour. What, still nothing?"
30330,Damon, How you doing in there? Come on. Is the old you ready to come out and play?
30331,Elena, Go to hell
30332,Damon," Ok. Back you go. We can do this the nice way, or we can do it the other way, but either way, we're not stopping until you turn your humanity switch back on. So I'm gonna let you think about that, and I'm gonna come back for you in a couple hours or a couple years because all we have is time"
30333,Caroline, Where is she? I want to see her
30334,Stefan," We're not letting anyone see her. That's the whole point. Isolation leads to misery, leads to emotion"
30335,Caroline, She's been here for days. She hasn't improved at all?
30336,Stefan," Look. She doesn't want to, Caroline, not yet, all right? She's devastated. She lost her brother. She attacked her friends. She k*ll an innocent woman"
30337,Caroline, You said that you knew to help her
30338,Stefan, I did say that. We are
30339,Caroline," How, by torturing her?"
30340,Stefan," It's not torture. It's an intervention. The only chance we have with her is to provoke her, to trigger something... Fear, anger, self-pity, anything"
30341,Caroline," Let me talk to her before any more interventioning. If she's weak, she can't hurt me. Please just let me try"
30342,Stefan, Good luck
30343,Caroline, I brought you something
30344,Caroline," It doesn't have any vervain in it, I swear. I just figured a little bl*od might help you think straight. For the record, I don't agree with what they're doing. I mean, I agree that you need to turn your humanity back on, but I don't think that making you suffer is the way to do it. That's not who you are"
30345,Elena, What makes you such an expert on who I am?
30346,Caroline, Because we've been friends forever
30347,Elena," I tried to k*ll you, Caroline. I'm not exactly BFF material anymore. You should move on"
30348,Caroline, I am not going to give up on you
30349,Elena," This annoying, clingy thing that you're doing, did it ever occur to you maybe that's why both your boyfriends skipped town? I mean, I know that Tyler said he was running for his life. Maybe he was running from you. And Klaus... I mean, let's just say it. Nobody likes a tease. Hey, I'm not judging. Might be nice to have a bad boy ruffle those perfect feathers"
30350,Caroline," You're in pain. You're lashing out. I get it, but you can't stay this way forever. We're about to graduate and start new lives, and you deserve..."
30351,Elena," Are you seriously talking about High-School graduation? Caroline, do you realize how pathetic you're gonna look in that cap and gown pretending to be human while your mom fake-smiles and just counts down the minutes until you leave town so that you can stop being a reminder that her daughter is a repulsive, bl*od sucking, control freak monster? It's really too bad Stefan stopped me before I put you out of your misery, but, hey, here's to second chances"
30352,Caroline, Elena?
30353,Caroline, Do whatever you have to do. I'm gonna be upstairs
30354,Rebekah, I was wondering if you were gonna say hello or keep ignoring me
30355,Matt, I was working. I see you compelled the bartenders again
30356,Rebekah," My brothers and I have parted company. Elijah and Nik have run off to New Orleans chasing God knows what, and I am finally free"
30357,Matt, Yeah. I heard about that
30358,Rebekah," Did you hear that I lost the cure to Silas? I was this close to the life that I always wanted, and then, poof, gone in a b*at"
30359,Matt, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted it
30360,Rebekah," Please. I know you were planning on stealing it for Elena. I never had a chance, did I?"
30361,Matt," I meant what I said, but if you want to feel sorry for yourself, go ahead"
30362,Rebekah, Why don't you stay and have a drink?
30363,Matt, I can’t. I've got to go meet Caroline
30364,Rebekah, Are they still keeping Elena trapped in the Salvatore mansion? I happen to like her just the way she is. It's tragic that they're trying so desperately to fix something that isn't broken
30365,Matt," Elena was my friend long before she was your mean-girl sidekick. So if you're upset that you lost the cure and your brothers ditched you, why are you still in Mystic Falls? Some of us don't have the option of leaving. Some of us are broke and failing all of our classes and stuck here. So why don't you take your freedom and get the hell out of town? I would"
30366,Caroline," Bonnie, where have you been? I left you, like, 90 million messages"
30367,Bonnie," Studying French. We still have final exams, remember?"
30368,Caroline," Oh, don't remind me. Look. This whole thing with Elena, it's about to get brutal, and I know that she's not your favorite person right now, but I could really use you over here"
30369,Bonnie," For what, moral support or so you can check up on me?"
30370,Caroline, Moral support and maybe just a tiny check-in to make sure that Silas isn't playing any more pesky
30371,Bonnie," I'm fine, ok? Silas doesn't control me anymore. And I think I'll pass on the invite. Elena tried to k*ll me. I'm not quite ready to forgive and forget. I'm gonna call you later, ok? I got to go"
30372,Katherine," Lying, scheming, and a secret rendezvous with moi? Not very Bonnie Bennett-y, especially when"
30373,Bonnie, This has nothing to do with them. This is between you and me
30374,Katherine," All right. Well, luckily for you, I've got some spare time on my hands. You said you have an offer that I can't refuse. Well, by all means. What do you have in mind?"
30375,Damon, Good. You're awake. We thought you could use a little sunshine. Looking for this? Aw. You know the rules. Bad girls don't get nice jewelry
30376,Elena, You took my ring. I'm devastated. And bored. Can I go back to solitary now?
30377,Damon," No. I kind of like you in the hot seat. Whenever you're ready, brother"
30378,Elena, Am I supposed to be scared?
30379,Stefan," You will be. And when you are, focus on that fear. It's the key to getting your humanity back"
30380,Elena, You're not gonna burn me
30381,Damon, You don’t think so?
30382,Elena," No. And even if you do manage to get my emotions back, I'll remember all this. And I'll hate both of you for it"
30383,Damon, Tsk. Worth the risk
30384,Damon," That feels better, huh? How about a little gratitude or any human emotion whatsoever? And we can stop this. I didn't quite catch that"
30385,Elena," I said, I'm gonna k*ll you"
30386,Damon, Bingo. See? There's a little rage. I should have figured that'd be the first emotion that came out of you. I tend to pull that out of people
30387,Stefan," Elena, look at me. We don't want to do this, ok? You can stop this right now. It's your choice"
30388,Elena," Kind of funny, actually, you being the one to pull back the curtain. I bet part of you enjoys it since, you know, I dumped you and all"
30389,Damon, Wow. That was downright vindictive. See? I think now we're breaking through that tough candy shell and getting into the ooey-gooey rich center of your humanity. This is good. I think we should shine some light on the subject
30390,Elena, Let me guess... This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me
30391,Stefan," Look, I know what you're going through. After all you've done, you're afraid to face the guilt you'll feel if you turned your emotions back on. The only way we can help you is to make the alternative hurt even worse"
30392,Caroline," Oh, we have to keep talking. If we don't keep talking, then I won't be able to stop myself from listening in. And I can't stand to hear Elena in pain"
30393,Matt, What do you want to talk about?
30394,Caroline, I don't know. Anything. I ordered you a cap and gown
30395,Matt, You did?
30396,Caroline," I just figured that you'd forget, so I ordered yours when I ordered mine. And I got one for Elena, too"
30397,Matt, It's gonna work. We're gonna get Elena back
30398,Caroline, What the hell is she doing here?
30399,Rebekah, I don't mean to interfere. It's just I happen to know all they keep in this house is bl*od and booze. So I brought a peace offering. Burgers?
30400,Matt, Thanks
30401,Caroline," Yeah, we can't really entertain right now, but thanks for stopping by"
30402,Rebekah, I think I might stay. Matt mentioned that he was failing classes and needed a study buddy
30403,Caroline," You're failing? Well, why didn't you ask me to help you study?"
30404,Matt," Well, I didn't exactly ask her"
30405,Caroline," Well, what classes are you failing?"
30406,Matt," I'm not failing. I'm just really, really behind. History and Italian and math"
30407,Caroline, Matt!
30408,Matt, This year's been a little distracting
30409,Rebekah," We could both help. ""All hands on deck."" That's the motto around here, right?"
30410,Caroline," We don't have a motto. Look, if you need to study, we're gonna study. I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna get my flash cards and my study guides and some energy bars. This is gonna be good"
30411,Rebekah, You dated that?
30412,Matt, She likes projects
30413,Caroline, Who’s there?
30414,Caroline, Oh my god
30415,Klaus," Hello, Caroline"
30416,Katherine, Let me get this straight. You want me to hand over Silas' tombstone? What makes you think I even have it?
30417,Bonnie, I know you took it from the island. You're a scavenger. You'd never leave it behind
30418,Katherine," So you're working for Silas now, huh? Running errands for the big, bad immortal"
30419,Bonnie," I didn’t switch sides. In two days, there'll be a full moon. Silas wants me to harness its power to drop the veil between our side and the other side. He wants to take the cure, and then he wants to die. I said I'd help him, and I've been hiding from him ever since, buying time"
30420,Katherine, Time for what?
30421,Bonnie, You don't need to worry about it. You just need to bring me the tombstone
30422,Katherine, It's a hunk of rock. What do you even want with it?
30423,Bonnie," The less you know, the better. Silas is psychic. He can get into people's heads, read their minds, make them see things that aren't really there. I'm taking a big enough risk just talking to you"
30424,Katherine, Ok. Then how do I know that you're not him? 
30425,Bonnie, You don't. But I'm not
30426,Katherine, And what makes you so sure that I'm not him?
30427,Bonnie, Because he can't get into my head anymore. Because I am the only one who can see his true face
30428,Katherine, What's in it for me?
30429,Bonnie," Bring me the tombstone. Help me stop Silas from unleashing hell on earth. Believe me, I'll make it worth your while"
30430,Damon," You're gonna thank me for this. After you turn it back on, you'll realize life with no emotions blew"
30431,Elena," You know what else blew? Being sired to you. Going every day believing that I was in love with you. I remember every horrible moment of it. And you... So scared that it wasn't real. Well, guess what. It wasn't. You were right. So go ahead. Keep trying to get the old me back. Who knows? Maybe Stefan and I will give it another go"
30432,Elena, I am the girl that you love. You wouldn't do anything to actually hurt me. You just proved that. So what do I really have to be afraid of?
30433,Stefan, So that went well
30434,Damon," Every other vampire turns it on, no problem. You k*ll. You feed. You do all the awful things that a vampire does. And then when you're done, you turn it back on. Why is she being so stubborn?"
30435,Stefan, Because she has nothing to come back to. Her home's gone. Her family's gone. She alienated her friends. She destroyed her relationships
30436,Damon, No. She wants to come back. Scaring the hell out of her should have worked. She's smart. She knows we're not gonna hurt her
30437,Stefan," All right. So we get somebody else, somebody who really will hurt her"
30438,Damon, Who? Katherine?
30439,Stefan," Think about it. She's the reason Jeremy's dead, right? So if anybody's gonna provoke an emotion, it's her"
30440,Damon, So we call her and then what? Beg her to help us out of the kindness of her own heart? You kidding me?
30441,Stefan, Katherine was just abandoned by Elijah. She has nothing. She has no one. We invite her into our house to come torture Elena. There's no way she's gonna turn that down
30442,Caroline, Everyone said that you were gone for good
30443,Klaus, That's true. But I never meant to go without saying good-bye
30444,Caroline," You don't owe me an explanation. You're moving on. By all means, go"
30445,Klaus," Well, that's just it, isn't it? I never had any intention of moving on. The truth is, I've tried to stop thinking about you. And I can't. Come to New Orleans. What are you afraid of?"
30446,Caroline, You! I’m afraid of you!
30447,Klaus," Wouldn't it be more accurate to say you're afraid of yourself, your darkest desires? Elena was right, wasn't she? Deep down, you long to have your perfect feathers ruffled"
30448,Caroline, How do you know what Elena said to me in that cell?
30449,Klaus/Silas," Then again... There's so much to be afraid of, isn't there, like what I'll do to you if your friend Bonnie doesn't come out of hiding. Where is she?"
30450,Caroline, Silas
30451,Klaus/Silas, Where is she?! She's not at home. She's not anywhere. Bonnie is playing games with me. And I don't like it. Tell her I'm looking for her. Tell her to come out of the shadows. Tell her that this... Is only the beginning
30452,Matt, What time will Caroline return from the train station?
30453,Rebekah," Well, that's handy. Sort of a cheat, though, isn't it?"
30454,Matt, Not everyone's had a thousand years to learn everything about everything
30455,Rebekah," I'm not sure how good I am at learning Italian. I was fluent in the 12th century, but languages have a way of evolving"
30456,Matt, So can you help or not?
30457,Rebekah, Of course I can. Don't be cranky. I was just teasing
30458,Matt, I'm sorry. I just don't want to get left behind when all my friends go to college and I'm the only repeat senior
30459,Rebekah," The only reason that you are failing is because you're preoccupied with training doomed hunters and dealing with Elena's drama. You need better friends, like me. I could compel you good grades, get a scholarship"
30460,Matt, I don't want to do that
30461,Rebekah," Why not? Everyone needs an advantage in life. I could be yours. When you convinced me to save April Young's life at the prom, I realized that I could be a better person. And I'm grateful for that. So let me give you some advice. Take advantage of what I'm offering you. Make something of yourself. For the record, anyone who leaves you behind is a fool. I wouldn't"
30462,Katherine, What a beautiful sentiment
30463,Damon, Seriously? You can't knock?
30464,Katherine, Sorry. I didn't realize we were standing on formalities
30465,Rebekah, What the hell are you doing here?
30466,Katherine, You didn't get the memo? I'm here to talk some sense into poor emotionless Elena
30467,Matt, Are you out of your mind?
30468,Damon," You got a better idea, prom King? Unless you want me to lock you up in there with her, I suggest you shut up and let the adults handle this"
30469,Rebekah," Well, it looks like the lunatics have taken over the asylum. Where are you going?"
30470,Matt, I'm calling Caroline. There's no way we're letting that psycho in there with Elena
30471,Matt, Caroline!
30472,Caroline, Matt!
30473,Matt, Where have you been?
30474,Caroline, We have to get out of here
30475,Matt," No, Caroline. Caroline, wait. It's ok"
30476,Caroline," No, it's not ok. Silas is out there. And he made me think that he was Klaus..."
30477,Matt, What are you talking about? What's Silas want with you?
30478,Caroline, He's trying to get to Bonnie. Do you know where Bonnie is?
30479,Matt," If I knew where she was, I wouldn't bother with you. Now, get me Bonnie, or I'm going to k*ll someone. Maybe I'll start with your mother"
30480,Klaus, No one in the house can help you. Find Bonnie or I'll k*ll the person you love the most
30481,Liz, I know. I promised I wouldn't work too late
30482,Caroline," Mom, I need you to get home and lock all the doors right now. Don't let anyone inside, not even me because I have a key, so I can let myself in. Do you understand?"
30483,Liz, What's going on?
30484,Caroline," Just do it, OK? I'm on my way"
30485,Katherine," Oh, honey, you look awful"
30486,Elena, What the hell are you doing here?
30487,Katherine," Your boyfriends invited me. They want to know if you still have a heart. There it is. Your bodyguards won't let me k*ll you, but I can rip your throat out. So I don't have to listen to you whine. But first, satisfy my curiosity. What did you tell Elijah back in Willoughby?"
30488,Elena," That's why you're here. He dumped you, didn't he? Now you're just looking for a scapegoat"
30489,Katherine, Tell me what you said to turn him against me or I will feed you your own eyeballs
30490,Elena, I didn't have to say anything. Look at you. A self-obsessed egomaniac on the run for 5 centuries. What good would you be to anyone? You're the definition of damaged goods. No wonder Elijah left you
30491,Katherine," Yeah, I've done some pretty horrible things to survive. But unlike you, poor, delicate Elena, I don't turn it off. I deal with it. You wouldn't last a week as a vampire without everyone fawning over you. But I'd love to see you try"
30492,Katherine, All that pain and torture of her took quite a thirst
30493,Damon," It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that Elena called you out on your recent boy trouble, could it? Sorry. I couldn't help but overhear"
30494,Katherine, Did you ever think Elena would have been better off if she'd never met you?
30495,Damon, You're trying to get a rise out of me? Because my emotions are fine. I love Elena. I despise you
30496,Katherine," Mm, so romantic. So doomed to fail. You know, as soon as she goes back to her old self, she'll go straight to Stefan. That's the tragedy of you. You never get the girl"
30497,Stefan, She's gone
30498,Damon, What?
30499,Stefan, Elena's not in her cell. I'm gonna check the grounds. Find out what she did
30500,Katherine, Oops. Did I forget to lock her in? Let's just say I've lost interest in Elena's recovery. I'd rather watch her tear through an orphanage. Imagine trying to come back from a spiral like that
30501,Matt, Elena’s gone? What happened?
30502,Damon," Donovan, you're coming with me"
30503,Rebekah, Why should he?
30504,Damon," Because Elena's hungry and missing. For once, his life might actually have a purpose"
30505,Caroline," Bonnie, why aren't you answering? Silas isn't going to just give up. You're the only one that can stop him. Call me"
30506,Liz," Caroline, what's going on?"
30507,Caroline," Mom, don't come any closer. Stop"
30508,Liz, What's wrong?
30509,Caroline, I don't know how to tell if it's really you. What if this is another trick? He can get in my head and he would have known that I called you
30510,Liz," Ok, Caroline. It's me. It's your mother. I don't know what's happening, but everything's going to be ok. All right? You just need to talk to me"
30511,Liz, Hi. How's it going?
30512,Caroline," Oh, good"
30513,Elena, Please help me
30514,Elena, Matt. Thank God you found me
30515,Matt," Elena, stop. I know you don't want to do this. I know you don't want to hurt me"
30516,Elena," I'm a vampire, Matt. The thing about vampires is that we need to feed"
30517,Matt," No, but you're more than that. You're my friend. You're my oldest friend. You're my friend. You're my oldest friend. You’re the girl that I’ve loved longer that I can remember. Whatever wall you want to put up, I know that still means something to you"
30518,Elena, Deep down... It probably does mean something... But I am really hungry
30519,Caroline, Bonnie hasn't called back yet. I just don't understand why she hasn't called
30520,Bonnie, What’s going on? Are you all right?
30521,Caroline, I've been calling you for hours
30522,Bonnie," Sorry. I came as soon as I got the message. Caroline, let me in. Let me help"
30523,Caroline," How do I know it's you? Silas keeps getting in my head, attacking me. He says he wants to know where you are. He threatened my mother"
30524,Liz, Caroline?
30525,Caroline," Mom, just stay there"
30526,Bonnie," Caroline, that is not your mother"
30527,Caroline," What's going on? Oh, my God"
30528,Silas," Did you really think you could hide from me, Bonnie?"
30529,Bonnie, I'm here now. What did you do to her mother?
30530,Silas, She's right where you left her
30531,Caroline, Mom? Mom! Ohh…
30532,Silas, I thought you and I were on the same side
30533,Bonnie," We are. The full moon isn't for two more days. I've been gathering my strength, preparing myself"
30534,Silas," You're the only one who can do this spell. So I can't hurt you. But I can hurt the people you love. You do understand that, right?"
30535,Bonnie, I understand. I will do your spell. I will drop the veil. And I will help you die. I promise Just don't hurt my friends
30536,Silas," Your promise is binding, Bonnie. If you break it, you have to answer to me"
30537,Bonnie, I won't break it
30538,Silas," Then you should leave this house right now. And the next time I come looking for you, I expect you to be waiting"
30539,Elena," Oh, come on. I barely drained an artery. Come on. Get up. I'm hungry. And my head's fuzzy. I can't think straight. I need more"
30540,Matt," Elena, stop"
30541,Elena, But you're so good
30542,Stefan," Hey, hey. You're cut off"
30543,Elena, Let go of me
30544,Damon, Stop it. Enough. You are acting like a little spoiled brat. You know that? You think that we can't punish you. Maybe not. But I can sure punish him
30545,Matt, Elena…
30546,Elena, Seriously? You think this is...
30547,Damon," Shut up. I'm done playing nice. Turn your emotions back on right now, Elena, or so help me, God, I will give you something to be sad about. I will k*ll him right here in front of you"
30548,Stefan, Damon
30549,Damon," Don't ""Damon"" me. If she doesn't love anyone, fine. Prove it. And if I'm wrong, what difference does it make? One less bus boy"
30550,Matt, Elena….
30551,Elena, You're bluffing
30552,Damon, How about now?
30553,Damon," You feel anything now? You angry I just turned your buddy into road k*ll? Or are you sad that the guy that everybody loves is just a bag of bones? Remember when he was a little kid, huh? Warm heart, big, goofy smile, his whole life ahead of him. I guess it was a good idea that he was wearing this"
30554,Elena," Oh, God, Matt"
30555,Damon," You feeling that weight lifting off your chest? That's joy. Because your friend isn't dead. That's emotion, Elena. That's humanity"
30556,Damon, You're gonna be ok
30557,Elena, No
30558,Damon, Look at me
30559,Elena, No. No. No. It's not ok
30560,Damon, Elena
30561,Elena, What I've done?
30562,Damon, Hey
30563,Elena," No, no. What did I do? I almost k*ll him. Matt. I almost... and then Bonnie and Caroline. I just... no, no. I mean, the woman, the waitress. I actually k*ll that waitress. No! I k*ll... That waitress"
30564,Stefan," Hey. Elena. Hey. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. I know this stage, ok? The emotions are overwhelming you. You just have to focus on one thing, ok?"
30565,Elena," No, I can't. I can't"
30566,Stefan," You just find that one thing inside of you that makes you strong. It's in there. Just latch on to it. Channel everything you're feeling into that one emotion. Find the thing inside of you that makes you want to live. Elena, let it in. Let it in. That's good. That's it. That's it. Just breathe it in. Blow everything else out. That's good. That's good. You ok?"
30567,Elena, No. I’m not okay but I'll get better
30568,Caroline, Come on. This will work
30569,Caroline, Mom? Open your eyes. Come on. Wake up. You have to wake up. You have to see me graduate. I swear I'll get... I swear I'll get you out of this town and find you a nice man. Mom!
30570,Rebekah, I've never actually seen that ring in action before. Does it hurt?
30571,Matt, You mean getting my neck snapped or coming back from the dead? Because they both hurt like hell. Did it work?
30572,Rebekah," Well, it looks like Elena's emotional floodgates have been burst wide open. So she'll be back to her dull, sympathetic self in no time. Here. That was a brave thing to do"
30573,Matt, She saved me from drowning at the bottom of that river. I'm just doing what I can to pay her back
30574,Rebekah," There aren't enough apologies in the world for the part that I played in this. Running you off the bridge, Elena becoming a vampire to save you. If you don't want me to cheat you into college, fine. We'll do it the hard way. But, Matt... I will spend every day until graduation trying to find a way to pay you back"
30575,Katherine, I'm perfectly aware that tombstone isn't just a hunk of rock
30576,Bonnie, No kidding
30577,Katherine," And it got me thinking, all big spells require a source of power, a recurring element like a full moon, a comet. But that tombstone is filled with the bl*od of your ancient relative Katsooyay or whatever"
30578,Bonnie, Qetsiyah
30579,Katherine," She was powerful enough to create the other side. So maybe if you have her bl*od, you don't need a full moon to drop the veil. Maybe you can do it whenever you want. The thing I can't figure out is why do you want to drop the veil at all?"
30580,Bonnie, I have my reasons
30581,Katherine," And again, I ask, what's in it for me?"
30582,Bonnie," You'll get the one thing you want most in this world... Freedom, survival. Never having to run from anyone again. Once I've dropped the veil, I can speak to Qetsiyah. She created the spell that made Silas truly immortal, invulnerable to any w*apon. You'd like that for yourself, wouldn't you? I can give it to you"
30583,Katherine," Bonnie Bennett, we have a deal"
30584,Damon, Hey... There you go. How you feeling?
30585,Elena," The pain's still there. The grief... And shame. I get it now. Shutting it off, it's a cheat. I mean, you put up this wall and shut out everything that makes you who you are. Nothing affects you, nothing matters. But things do matter... Things happen that can't be undone and now I know there's something I need to do about that"
30586,Stefan," Elena, what you need to do is rest; take it easy for a couple of days. Maybe even a couple of years. Here"
30587,Elena, I... I'm done resting. I have to get ready. There's so much that I have to do
30588,Damon, Whoa. Hey. What are you talking about?
30589,Elena," Think about it. It's so obvious. Go back far enough, there's one person who brought us to this... Who ruined our lives... And look at you two. Everything that's happened to you, she did that. She brought Klaus to Mystic Falls; she turned Caroline into a vampire. She k*ll my brother. It all comes down to her... Katherine. Ok, Stefan said to focus on one thing, so I did. I focused on hate. And I hate her so much"
30590,Damon," Well, I don't think that's what he meant"
30591,Stefan," Elena, Katherine's not worth your time. Even if you spend 10 minutes of your life hating her, she wins"
30592,Elena, Not if I k*ll her
30593,Stefan, And?
30594,Elena, That did nothing for me. How was it for you?
30595,Stefan," Again. Good. Now, focus on letting it go"
30596,Elena, Or we could skip the sublimating part and you can tell me where she is so that I can rip her head off
30597,Stefan," I don't know where Katherine is and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you"
30598,Elena," Stefan, you're the one who told me to channel all of my emotions into one single feeling."
30599,Stefan," I realize that. I just figured it would be love, or hope, or compassion. Not unwavering hatred for a ruthless vampire that's 500 years older than you. Give me 50 pull-ups"
30600,Elena, You wanted to k*ll Klaus when you got your emotions back
30601,Stefan, I know and I couldn’t
30602,Elena, You don't think I can k*ll Katherine?
30603,Stefan, I don't think you really want to
30604,Elena," Maybe you're right. Maybe I just want to feel the warmth of her chest cavity as I rip out her heart and watch her face as she realizes I took it from her. Nah, I just want to k*ll her. It's that simple. I'm gonna go shower"
30605,Rebekah," So, let me get this straight. You send out a notice of your impending graduation, and people feel obliged to give you money?"
30606,Matt, Pretty much
30607,Rebekah, Sounds brilliant. Why aren't you participating?
30608,Matt, I don't have a whole lot of family
30609,Rebekah," Well, that makes two of us. Besides, I don't think it was my mother's dream to see me in a cap and gown. How about your mom?"
30610,Matt, Let's just say I'm not holding my breath for a graduation check
30611,Caroline," Stamp, please. Thank you"
30612,Elena," You don't have to pretend to be nice to me, Caroline. I know this is just a ploy to keep me distracted"
30613,Caroline, You're done? I'm only on my second batch
30614,Elena," We have family friends in Denver. Other than that, no one cares that I'm graduating. And to be honest, neither do I"
30615,Caroline," You know, that's how you feel now, but once you get through this hating Katherine phase..."
30616,Elena, Wait. Do you know where Katherine is?
30617,Caroline, No. Why would I know where she is?
30618,Elena," Yeah, but Caroline, if you did, you would tell me, right?"
30619,Caroline," Elena, you're obsessing"
30620,Elena," Caroline, listen to me. If you know where Katherine is, you have to tell me"
30621,Caroline, I don't. Elena... Chill.
30622,Katherine, Hello! Could you be any creepier? Why are we here?
30623,Bonnie," You want me to make you truly immortal so that nothing can k*ll you. To do that, I need to talk to Qetsiyah, which means I need to lower the veil to the other side"
30624,Katherine, That still doesn't explain why you made me trudge through mud in $500 boots
30625,Bonnie," A few miles that way, 12 hybrids were k*ll at the Lockwood cellar. And a few Miles that way, 12 humans died at the Young farm. And this is the site where 12 witches were k*ll"
30626,Katherine, 13 if you don't get to the point
30627,Bonnie," It's the expression triangle. I need to charge all 3 points and channel the mystical energy from Silas's tombstone. Once that happens, I can drop the veil inside the 3 points and just long enough to get what I need"
30628,Katherine, And what exactly do you need?
30629,Bonnie," Silas has done nothing but torment my friends. Now he wants to unleash hell on earth. He's evil. In 2,000 years, only one person has been able to put him down"
30630,Katherine, Let me guess. Qetsiyah
30631,Bonnie," If I can contact her, I can ask her how to do it. Now hand me the rock"
30632,Katherine," You're gonna flood Mystic Falls with dead, supernatural creatures so that you can ask a 2,000-year-old witch not one but two favors? Ha! I think I'll take my business elsewhere"
30633,Katherine, What the hell?
30634,Bonnie," I linked us. Which means you're stuck with me for the day. Silas can be anyone. If he gets in your head and figures out I don't need a full moon to do the spell, it's over. Now, about that tombstone"
30635,Damon, You just missed the donuts
30636,Stefan," Yeah, I was with Elena burning off a few thousand hate-filled calories. What happened to you helping me?"
30637,Damon," Help? Yes. Prolonging the inevitable, waste of my time"
30638,Stefan, Hmm. You're avoiding. How unexpected
30639,Damon," I'm not avoiding. Elena's only goal is to end Katherine's life, and that's not gonna just magically disappear with Pilates and a juice cleanse"
30640,Liz," Hey, guys. Thanks for coming"
30641,Damon, Hey. Why were we invited?
30642,Liz," Well, the hospital has kept the bl*od banks empty ever since they were raided last month. We thought at the very least, it would help keep the vampire population away"
30643,Stefan, And it didn't?
30644,Liz, See for yourself
30645,Liz, There were 4 other v*ctim in this wing. Each one almost completely drained of bl*od. You think it's Silas?
30646,Damon, Or a doctor with some very questionable bedside manner
30647,Liz, But 5 v*ctim? It's a lot of bl*od and it's not like he can take it with him
30648,Stefan, Unless he's fueling up for something big
30649,Liz," Big? Any details would be helpful, considering I'm dealing with 5 grieving families out there and a psychic k*ll on the loose"
30650,Damon, Silas wants Bonnie to do a spell to drop the veil from the other side
30651,Liz, I have no idea what that means
30652,Damon," It's an invisible wall that separates our plane from the plane of all dead supernatural creatures. Now, Silas wants that to go away so he can take the cure, die, and not have to spend an eternity in a supernatural purgatory"
30653,Liz, And when do you suppose Silas plans on doing this?
30654,Damon, Next full moon. Tomorrow night
30655,Katherine, Ugh. That old Lockwood cellar reeks of wet dog. I'll be staying up here
30656,Bonnie, You obviously don't know how this works
30657,Katherine," You realize I'm not just some wandering child in a supermarket, right? I’m a vampire that can k*ll you"
30658,Bonnie, Whatever happens to me happens to you. Do you really think I want you here?
30659,Katherine, And what is here? Oh. Right. 12 dead hybrids. This should be good
30660,Caroline, Is it supposed to rain tonight?
30661,Rebekah, Do I look like a meteorologist?
30662,Caroline," Someone needs to do something, before she explodes"
30663,Rebekah, I got this
30664,Rebekah, Drink. You're putting everyone on edge. So. What's the deal? I'm new to this whole emotional switch situation
30665,Elena, It's not complicated. See that dart board? All I can picture is Katherine's face
30666,Rebekah," So, your emotions are on, they're just dialed to rage"
30667,Elena," Look, Rebekah, I get that we had our Thelma and Louise thing back when I had my humanity off, but let me make one thing clear... We're not friends"
30668,Caroline," What about us? Are we still friends? All those things you said when your humanity was off, is that how you really feel?"
30669,Elena," Caroline, I really don't feel like going down memory lane"
30670,Caroline," Well, what about when you said, and I quote, ""you're a repulsive, blood-sucking, control freak monster""? Did you really mean those things?"
30671,Elena," If you're waiting for an apology, you're not gonna get one. I can't let myself feel bad, because if I feel bad, then I feel everything, and... We've all seen how well I handle that"
30672,Rebekah, The power's completely out
30673,Caroline, I’ll call my mom! Maybe she knows what's going on
30674,Bonnie, 12 humans b*rned to death here. They died in vain for Silas
30675,Katherine, What did you do?
30676,Bonnie, I linked the final hot spot. It's time to drop the veil
30677,Liz," The power outages originated at 3 different places in town... the Young farm, the Lockwood estate, and a blown transformer off old Miller Road"
30678,Stefan, These are the locations of the Silas massacres. It's the expression triangnle. Bonnie must be doing the spell
30679,Damon, So much for needing a full moon
30680,Liz, I know something else. One of the power company guys has a daughter who goes to school with Bonnie. He saw her leaving the Young farm an hour ago with Elena
30681,Stefan, But Caroline's with Elena
30682,Damon, Looks like Bonnie Bennett has a new doppelganger friend
30683,Liz," So, how do we find them?"
30684,Stefan," Well, they must be somewhere in the triangle. My guess is right in the middle"
30685,Damon, And where exactly might that be?
30686,Stefan, Where's Caroline?
30687,Elena, Inside looking for Bonnie. I think we should split up. Damon and I can look outside while you and Caroline look inside
30688,Stefan, All right. Let me know if you find anything
30689,Damon, Someone's an eager beaver
30690,Elena, Where's Katherine?
30691,Damon," Now I get it. One brother sh**t you down, you ask the other one. Great"
30692,Elena," You know, don't you?"
30693,Damon, Do you not notice all the end of the world crap going on right now?
30694,Elena, Tell me that you don't want her dead. After everything that she did to you. Stringing you along for hundreds of years
30695,Damon," Elena, we don't need to list all the reasons that I hate Katherine. What we need to do is find Bonnie. Come on"
30696,Elena, I don't care about Bonnie. I care about k*ll Katherine
30697,Damon, They're together. Ok? So maybe you should do a little less threatening and a little more looking. Come on
30698,Stefan, Hey. There you are. Any luck?
30699,Caroline, I searched the whole school. She should be here
30700,Caroline, What was that?
30701,Stefan, Hmm. Ice is melting
30702,Caroline," It just doesn't make any sense. This is the center of the triangle. If she's gonna do the spell, she has to do it here. This is where they should be"
30703,Stefan," Actually, I think we're in the right place. Just the wrong elevation"
30704,Bonnie, Ok. This is the center of the triangle. I'm ready. Now give me the tombstone
30705,Katherine, The fact that this spell hinges on some crappy hunk of blood-rock does little to inspire my confidence
30706,Bonnie," It's filled with the calcified bl*od of Qetsiyah, one of the strongest witches in the world"
30707,Damon," If I remember correctly, I think there's an entrance in the basement"
30708,Stefan, Where's the basement?
30709,Elena, Off the boiler room
30710,Damon, You hear that? I'll meet you there
30711,Damon, You're gonna have to stay here
30712,Elena, Are you kidding me?
30713,Damon," We really need to stop Bonnie from doing this spell, and if you get all m*rder and screw it up..."
30714,Elena, Is that really the reason?
30715,Damon," As self-righteous as Stefan is, he has a point. Behind your rage, there is a tidal wave of feelings. All of your guilt, all your grief. Every emotion you've ever put off. And k*ll Katherine's gonna let it all in, and if you can't handle it, then we're back to square one"
30716,Elena," And if I can? What if k*ll Katherine takes away all that grief and guilt? What if k*ll Katherine finally lets me feel all the good things that I've lost? Damon, help me. As soon as I get over this hurdle, I'll be me. I'll be able to think clearly. I'll be myself and everything will go back to normal"
30717,Damon, She's strong. And crafty. And you'll die
30718,Elena, Then at least I'll die trying
30719,Katherine, What is happening?
30720,Bonnie, I'm channeling the expression triangle. It's done. The veil is down
30721,Alaric, Need a hand?
30722,Damon," So, this is either really good or really bad"
30723,Alaric," It's good to see you, too, Damon"
30724,Damon," I'd say the feeling was mutual, except a lot of people aren't exactly who they say they are around here"
30725,Alaric, You think I'm Silas? Are you kidding me?
30726,Damon," Uhh. See, this puts us in a bit of a pickle, ‘cause that is exactly what Silas would say"
30727,Alaric," Now, would Silas know about locker 42?"
30728,Damon," Hang on. If I can see you, and I can touch you that means the little witch did it. She dropped the veil"
30729,Alaric," Well, not completely. It's only down inside the expression triangle. If I step outside of it, it's back to ghost world"
30730,Damon," Where's everybody? I figure with the veil down, it'd be like ghost-a-palooza"
30731,Alaric," Not every ghost has a reason to come back to Mystic Falls. Just the ones like me, looking out for their idiot best friends"
30732,Damon, I'm more worried about the ones looking out for their enemies
30733,Matt," This wind is weird. One minute it was blowing like a hurricane. Now nothing, not even a breeze"
30734,Rebekah, Looks like something wicked finally came
30735,Matt," You know, you don't have to be here. I mean, technically, one of us is getting paid"
30736,Rebekah, But it's fun. And kind of cozy. With the storm outside and the candlelight. And us
30737,Rebekah," Oh, my God. Kol"
30738,Kol," Greetings from the dead. So, who fancies a drink?"
30739,Rebekah, I thought I'd never see you again
30740,Kol," Spare me the waterworks, sister. I've already watched you grieve. Lasted a full 24 hours, remember?"
30741,Matt, I'm assuming this means Bonnie dropped the veil
30742,Kol," Not completely, and not for long. But who am I to give up an opportunity for revenge? My k*ll's already dead, but his sister's just as culpable. So maybe you could help me find her"
30743,Matt, If you hurt Elena...
30744,Kol," Oh… I’m going to. But please, continue. I'm curious as to where you're going with this"
30745,Rebekah," You've made your point, Kol. Leave"
30746,Kol, First tell me where I can find Elena
30747,Rebekah, She left here hours ago. We don't know where she is. Now get out
30748,Kol," I see you finally got the quarterback to pay attention to you. How's the throwing arm, champ?"
30749,Katherine," Tick tock, Bonnie"
30750,Bonnie, Stop talking. I can't reach out to Qetsiyah with you breaking my concentration every 5 seconds
30751,Katherine, Bonnie. Did you hear that? Someone's coming
30752,Bonnie, Will you be quiet?
30753,Katherine," I have vampire hearing, Bonnie, and there's someone here. Unlink me so that I can go stall them while we wait for Qetsiyah to show up"
30754,Bonnie, I'm not letting you go
30755,Katherine, Then at least give me some slack
30756,Bonnie, Fine. Go. Stop them
30757,Katherine, Silas? Come and get me
30758,Elena," Hello, Katherine"
30759,Katherine, I let you out of your cage and this is how you thank me?
30760,Elena, No. This is how I thank you
30761,Stefan," Bonnie. Bonnie, what happened?"
30762,Bonnie, Katherine. Find Katherine. We're linked
30763,Caroline, Then unlink her. You go. I'll stay with Bonnie
30764,Elena," You have done nothing but suck the happiness out of my life. Uhh. Well, now I get to k*ll you"
30765,Katherine," No, wait, please"
30766,Elena," Good-bye, Katherine"
30767,Elena, Stefan!
30768,Katherine," Thanks for the save, handsome"
30769,Stefan, Get the hell out of here before I k*ll you myself
30770,Katherine, Really? I’m your biggest problem right now?
30771,Rebekah," You know, I could just cure this for you easily, right?"
30772,Matt, I’ll be fine
30773,Rebekah, Why won't you ever let me help you?
30774,Matt," It's not you, it's... Look, people in this town have a bad habit of turning into vampires and I'd like to graduate High School as a human. I think there's a first aid kit in the back"
30775,Rebekah, Ok
30776,Rebekah," Caroline, how are you still here... Oh my god"
30777,Caroline, I have to keep cutting
30778,Caroline," Bonnie, are you ok?"
30779,Bonnie," Yeah, now that I unlinked her"
30780,Caroline, What are you doing down here?
30781,Bonnie, Waiting for Qetsiyah
30782,Caroline," You might be waiting a while. Qetsiyah's not coming, Bonnie"
30783,Bonnie, But... I saw Caroline. How? I thought you couldn't get inside my head
30784,Silas, That's what I wanted you to think. I can make you see whatever I want you to see. Am I a disfigured monster? Of course not. A monster is what I wanted you to see. That's the beauty of all this. You have no idea who I am. Or what I look like. Or how deep I am inside of your head. You thought that you were more powerful than me? I'm stronger than you can imagine. I defeated the hunter's curse in minutes. You thought that you could betray me. You can't. I will always be one step ahead
30785,Elena, How could you save her? She was as good as dead
30786,Stefan," Yeah, and so was Bonnie. Bonnie used a spell to link herself to Katherine, so if you k*ll her, Bonnie would be dead, too"
30787,Elena, How do you know that?
30788,Stefan," Because I saw her, Elena. You almost k*ll your best friend"
30789,Elena, I don’t believe you
30790,Stefan, Really?
30791,Elena," You never wanted me to k*ll Katherine. Why are you protecting her, Stefan?"
30792,Stefan, Listen to yourself. Your rage is making you crazy
30793,Elena, Do you still have feelings for her?
30794,Stefan," This isn't even about Katherine. This is about Jeremy. What, you think that k*ll her will take all that pain away? It won’t"
30795,Elena," Oh, but b*at up cinder blocks will?"
30796,Stefan," No. It's a distraction. Just like k*ll Katherine, just like turning your emotions off. The truth is, there are no shortcuts. You are a vampire, Elena. Loss is part of the deal. Look, I've been alive for 163 years. I have lost more loved ones than I can count and it hurts me every single time"
30797,Elena," So, there's no hope. You're saying I'm hopeless"
30798,Stefan, No. I'm saying you have to face your grief. But you don't have to do it alone. I can help you
30799,Elena," Oh, of course you can. God, Stefan, always trying to help and your concern for me is just like..."
30800,Stefan, You're transferring some rage on me. That's good
30801,Elena, I don't need to transfer anything. I can hate two people just fine
30802,Stefan, Elena…
30803,Elena, Just like the cinder block. Nothing
30804,Rebekah," Caroline, hey. Snap out of it"
30805,Caroline, I need to bleed. Silas wants me to bleed
30806,Rebekah, Stop it. You're hallucinating
30807,Caroline, Just let me do this. I need to do this
30808,Rebekah, You’re going to cut your hand’s off
30809,Matt, She's been here the whole time. That means Silas is with you
30810,Damon, Perfect
30811,Matt," Yeah, it gets worse. The veil's down. Kol came by looking for Elena. Seemed a little pissed"
30812,Damon," Do you have any good news for me, Donovan?"
30813,Matt, We’ll handle this. .Just watch your back
30814,Damon, Call Stefan. Tell him about Caroline. Tell him to keep an eye on Elena. God knows he'll do a better job than me
30815,Alaric, Stefan? Isn't she your girlfriend?
30816,Damon, Who knows? I know she was sired to me. I know her emotions were off. I know she's so full of rage she wants to rip Katherine's head off...
30817,Alaric, But you have no idea how she feels about you and now you're freaking out
30818,Damon, Call Stefan
30819,Matt, Have you tried compelling her?
30820,Rebekah, I can't. She's on vervain
30821,Caroline, Let me go!
30822,Rebekah," Look, Caroline, you're graduating and Uncle Bob and Aunt Mary really want you to graduate with both your hands"
30823,Caroline, I need to keep cutting. I need to keep cutting. I need to keep cutting
30824,Rebekah, Stop!
30825,Caroline, Bitch!
30826,Rebekah, That is the Caroline I know and loathe
30827,Bonnie, Stay away from me
30828,Caroline/Silas," Gladly. Once you finish the spell. Then when the veil is dropped completely, I can take the cure. I just want to pass on, Bonnie. I'll even let you k*ll me. I'll be out of your life for good"
30829,Bonnie, But every dead supernatural creature will be roaming the earth
30830,Caroline/Silas," Well, if you don't help me, I'll be roaming the earth"
30831,Bonnie, I was never gonna drop the veil
30832,Caroline/Silas, I'm curious. What was your plan? Pow-wow with Qetsiyah? Brainstorm ways to put me down? Qetsiyah's not coming. She wants me on the other side with her. For eternity
30833,Damon, Bonnie? Bonnie?
30834,Caroline/Silas, That sounds familiar
30835,Alaric/Silas, Maybe Damon will convince you
30836,Bonnie, I won't let you...
30837,Caroline/Silas," You won't let me what? You feel that, Bonnie? The air. Thinning. Barely enough to breathe"
30838,Elena," '""Brother and friend""? What genius came up with that one? I give up, Jer. I really wanted to k*ll her for you, but... There's no point. Stefan's right. It's just a distraction. And... I can't. I can't do this. I can't... I can't move on, and I don't want to. If that makes me weak, then fine, I'm weak. But I can't handle you... I can't handle you being gone... And I can't handle feeling like this anymore"
30839,Kol," Hello, old friend. Pity about your brother. Guess it's just me against you now"
30840,Sheila," Bonnie. This isn't real, Bonnie. Feel the air in your lungs. Break through"
30841,Bonnie, Silas?
30842,Sheila," Would Silas try and save your life? Now, breathe, child. There"
30843,Bonnie, I was so worried about you
30844,Sheila, I know but I’m okay. I've been watching over you
30845,Bonnie, I messed up. I’m sorry
30846,Sheila, You can still stop Silas
30847,Bonnie," No, I can't. Qetsiyah was able to immobilize him so he couldn't feed and get into people's heads. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to put him down"
30848,Sheila," You can do that. Expression is the manifestation of your will. You can do anything. I don't like it, but sometimes, there are no choices. But you are strong enough. You can do this"
30849,Alaric, Whoa. It's just me. I called Stefan. He's heading for Elena. Did you find Silas?
30850,Damon, Yup
30851,Alaric," Oh! Damon, it's me!"
30852,Damon," No, you're not. I've spent more time in these tunnels than I care to admit and there's no way you just came from the school. Your mind games don't work on me, Silas"
30853,Bonnie," I may not be able to k*ll you, but I will stop you. I will make the bl*od clot in your veins. I will make every bone, muscle, and joint in your body turn to stone"
30854,Damon, What the hell is happening?
30855,Bonnie, He can't hide behind his mind control anymore. He's becoming his true self
30856,Damon, Who exactly might his true self be?
30857,Bonnie, I guess we'll never know
30858,Kol," Now, this is what I've missed. Two people connecting. It's lonely on the other side. I swear, being invisible will drive you mad. The way you couldn't see me standing in front of you, or feel my breath on your cheek as I whispered all the ways that I wished for you to suffer. But at least, now you can"
30859,Elena," Go ahead, Kol. k*ll me. You'll be doing me a favor"
30860,Kol," As you wish, darling"
30861,Jeremy, How many times do I need to k*ll you?
30862,Kol," Jeremy Gilbert. You’re back. Now, what's the saying? k*ll me once, shame on you, k*ll me twice, shame on..."
30863,Stefan," Let's leave it at that, shall we?"
30864,Jeremy, Elena?! Elena?
30865,Elena, Jeremy
30866,Bonnie, You need to get rid of Silas's body
30867,Damon," Well, there's a slight problem, Medusa. Even though you turned him into stone, if he gets one more drop of bl*od, he's back to his old mind tricks"
30868,Stefan," All right. So, let's do what we should've done to Klaus. Let's drop his body in the middle of the ocean"
30869,Elena, Bonnie... I don't know what to say
30870,Bonnie, You don't have to say anything
30871,Elena, I was so horrible to you
30872,Bonnie, You weren't you. I know what that's like. I wasn't me for a long time. We can talk about that later. You got some catching up to do
30873,Jeremy, thank you Bonnie
30874,Bonnie, I'll give you guys as much time as I can... But I have to go put the veil back up
30875,Stefan, I should make sure Kol’s body is somewhere safe until the veil goes back up
30876,Elena, Stefan…
30877,Stefan, Welcome back
30878,Elena, There isn't enough time
30879,Damon, It'll never be enough time
30880,Elena," Damon, I'm sorry"
30881,Damon, Stop. The most important thing right now is Jeremy. And saying good-bye
30882,Caroline, Good. You're here. We need to celebrate
30883,Stefan," Yeah, I'm not really in the mood to... celebrate"
30884,Caroline," What's wrong with you? Silas is dead, or whatever, and you're just sitting here like a bump on a log"
30885,Stefan," There was someone that I thought I would see today, and... I didn't. That's all"
30886,Lexi, You better mean me
30887,Stefan, You've got to be kidding me
30888,Lexi, Thank you for keeping an eye on this one
30889,Damon, Calcified Silas is a heavy son of a bitch
30890,Alaric, Can't think of a more appropriate way to spent my last moments as a semi-living person
30891,Damon," Oh, I'm sorry. You have someplace better to be?"
30892,Alaric, Guess not
30893,Damon, Thought you were cutting back
30894,Alaric," Yeah, well... I thought you were gonna take care of the children"
30895,Damon, You heard that? That's not creepy
30896,Alaric," I... Found this in the dead guy's pocket. Thought it might do more use here than, say, 3 miles below sea level"
30897,Damon, What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
30898,Alaric, Get the girl
30899,Lexi, She punched you in the face?
30900,Stefan, Yep
30901,Lexi, Ha ha ha! Take a hint
30902,Stefan," So, you've been back what, 5 minutes, and you're already laughing at me?"
30903,Lexi, No. I've been laughing at you for a while. You just haven't been able to see me
30904,Stefan, Do you have any idea how much I missed you?
30905,Lexi, Trust me. I do. Although I see I've been replaced by another blonde
30906,Stefan, What'd you give me that look for?
30907,Lexi, She's cute
30908,Stefan, Do not start
30909,Sheila, You have to put up the veil
30910,Bonnie, Not yet
30911,Sheila," What are you doing, Bonnie?"
30912,Bonnie, I can bring Jeremy back. I can keep him here
30913,Sheila," No, you can’t"
30914,Bonnie, Elena needs him. This was always the plan. Jeremy wasn't supposed to die
30915,Sheila, It was the will of nature. There is no magic in this world that is strong enough to challenge it
30916,Bonnie, I have every magic. I have the spirits
30917,Sheila, stop it!
30918,Bonnie, I have expression
30919,Sheila," Stop it, Bonnie"
30920,Bonnie, And I have the darkness
30921,Sheila," Bonnie, stop"
30922,Matt, In case Caroline didn't thank you for pulling her out of that hallucination earlier... Thanks
30923,Rebekah, I'm just glad I got a chance to knock her upside the face
30924,Rebekah," Oh, my god"
30925,Matt, Who the hell is that?
30926,Rebekah, That is my ex-boyfriend Alexander. He's a vampire hunter. Thank God. The power's coming back. Maybe that means the veil's almost up and he'll disappear again
30927,Matt, Or not
30928,Rebekah, We should get out of here
30929,Connor, You should
30930,Vaughn, Too bad you can't
30931,Sheila," I'm sorry, Bonnie. The spell. It was just too much"
30932,Bonnie," Oh, my God. I’m dead"
30933,Kol," Welcome back. It was our deaths that allowed this day to come to pass - massacres performed in the name of resurrecting the immortal, Silas. Twelve hybrids, twelve witches, the slaughter of innocents by the so-called hero protectors of Mystic Falls. They risked unleashing hell on earth for their own selfish gains. And today that's exactly what they're going to get. "
30934,Stefan," Damon! Help me celebrate my 17th high school graduation. [Damon turns off the music.] Hey, you remember my friend, Lexi, of course? "
30935,Damon," Lexi, back from the dead. Goody. "
30936,Lexi," What's up, k*ll? "
30937,Damon," [strained] Stefan, you're just gonna sit there and let her enact her ghostly revenge? "
30938,Stefan," You reap what you sow, buddy. "
30939,Lexi," Let's be very clear: whatever time I have left here, I sure as hell don't plan on wasting on you. You got me? "
30940,Damon, Yeah. Got ya. 
30941,Damon," So if you and Ric and little Gilbert are all flesh-like and real-seeming, that means something went horribly wrong when Bonnie tried to put that veil up. And here you two are, having dance party USA. "
30942,Stefan," You're right. How selfish of me to be indulging in these precious moments with my formerly dead best friend. I should be sacrificing my own happiness for the good of others, right? I should be upstairs grooming my hero-hair. "
30943,Damon, Are you drunk? 
30944,Stefan," I don't know, Mom, am I? "
30945,Lexi, Okay. 
30946,Damon," Well, I guess that's one way to celebrate our supernatural apocalypse. [He takes a swig from the bottle.] Now, care to hazard any guesses on what the hell went wrong? "
30947,Bonnie, I hit kind of a snag. 
30948,Caroline, A snag? A snag is a bad yearbook picture. You hit a tsunami. Where are you? 
30949,Bonnie," I'm trying to fix it, but I'm running into some trouble. I need to wait until the full moon tonight to have enough power to put the veil back up. "
30950,Caroline, Are you telling me that we might graduate right smack in the middle of a ghost-filled Expression Triangle? 
30951,Bonnie, Maybe we should just cancel. 
30952,Caroline," No, we are not going to cancel. Graduation is the most important event of our lives, the last ceremony of our youth. It is our rite of freaking passage! Hell will freeze over before I let anyone cancel graduation. "
30953,Bonnie, Can you not make jokes about hell freezing over? We're not that far off from that already. 
30954,Caroline, Just promise me that today is a friend day. 
30955,Bonnie," Okay, I promise. I love you. "
30956,Caroline," I love you, too. "
30957,Sheila, Go. I'll make sure no one finds your body. But Bonnie-- 
30958,Bonnie," I know. Okay? I know I need to tell them, I just can't. They've been through too much already. "
30959,Sheila," I know, child. I was just going to say that... Make sure you say your goodbyes. "
30960,Alaric," [through a full mouth] Mm. Oh, my god. "
30961,Jeremy, Mm. 
30962,Elena," No grease on the Other Side, huh? "
30963,Alaric, You have no idea how much I've missed this. [holds up a bottle of bourbon] And this. 
30964,Alaric," No, hey. Hey! "
30965,Jeremy, She just got her humanity back. Let her live a little. 
30966,Elena," Hey, you wish. "
30967,Jeremy," I'm dead - what are they gonna do, throw me in juvie? "
30968,Alaric," Well, at least you'd have a place to live. "
30969,Elena, You both suck! 
30970,Alaric, Hey! Now there it is - that smile. I wasn't sure we were gonna see that again. 
30971,Elena, I did some pretty terrible things. 
30972,Jeremy," Hey, no. No tears. If Caroline was right, we only have until tonight. We need a no-crying rule. "
30973,Elena," But the crying's good. It means that I'm finally feeling something, and right now I... [she takes their hands in each of hers] I feel happy. "
30974,Elena," It's the Grill - it must be Matt. [answers it] Hey, you went AWOL this morning - what happened? "
30975,Connor," Hello, Elena. It's your dead friend, Connor. You remember me? "
30976,Alexander, A hidden compartment filled with advanced w*apon. Man has evolved from his days of throwing stones. 
30977,Rebekah," There is nothing we can do for you Alexander. Please, let us go. "
30978,Alexander," I'm not holding you here. Although, I have a feeling that exploding contraption will have a hard time parting with your handsome friend intact. "
30979,Matt," Just go, Rebekah. I'll be fine. "
30980,Rebekah, I'm not leaving you. 
30981,Alexander," The soldier, Connor, found a way to siphon venom from a werewolf. "
30982,Rebekah, What do you want from us? 
30983,Alexander," To fulfill my destiny. The brotherhood of hunters was created for one reason, and one reason alone. "
30984,Damon, Vaughn? 
30985,Vaughn," Got a little message for you, laddie. Straight from the mouth of the witch Qetsiyah. "
30986,Connor," We want Silas, and we want the cure. "
30987,Elena," I don't know where they are, so I guess I can't help you. "
30988,Connor," Huh. Well, you know who's gonna need some help? Grandma and Grandpa Jones, in town for the big high school graduation, along with Auntie Sue and Uncle Mark... "
30989,Connor," Matter of fact, everybody here at the Mystic Grill for graduation brunch. You either give me what I want, or they die. "
30990,Vaughn," Yeah, borrowed it from my jarhead friend, Connor. sh**t wood like lead. "
30991,Damon," Come on, man. I didn't k*ll you. "
30992,Vaughn," No, but you left me in that well on that island, where I starved to death. There I was, all alone on the Other Side, till Qetsiyah found me and reminded me of my supernatural destiny - to cure Silas, and then k*ll Silas. End of story-- "
30993,Elena," Please, don't hurt anyone. I'll find Silas and I'll get the cure. "
30994,Connor, Good. Get it done. 
30995,Alaric," So, you get off on terrorizing innocent people? "
30996,Connor, And who might you be? 
30997,Alaric, The guy responsible for the 18-year-old you just threatened. 
30998,Connor," Well, that 18-year-old snapped my neck with her bare hands. "
30999,Alaric, And I'm also the guy who showed her how to do that. 
31000,Connor, That's ironic. You must not know a damn thing about fighting if you're trying to intimidate a dead guy packing C4. 
31001,Alaric," This is my bar, pal. Nobody's gonna blow it up. "
31002,Alexander," Go ahead, sweet Rebekah. Use your vampire powers to whisk him away. I'm sure you can survive the blast of six of these... automobiles. Can he? "
31003,Matt, Just ignore him. All right? Let's think about something else. Like graduation. What are your plans - college? Travel? Just because I'm never getting out of this town doesn't mean you shouldn't see the world. 
31004,Rebekah, It's just been settled. I'm gonna show you life as you've only dreamt it. We'll start in Italy. There's a lovely little church-- [she glances back at Alexander] -- outside San Vittore in Brienno. 
31005,Alexander, [nodding] Romantic spot. Popular for weddings. 
31006,Rebekah," And then I'll show you the Northern Lights in the springtime, the Simatai Gorge from atop the Great Wall of China, every inch of the Louvre. "
31007,Matt," [smiling] China, Paris, the Northern Lights... It's a date. "
31008,Rebekah, We'll see it all when we're done here because we can. We're alive. [She looks scornfully back at Alexander.] We're not gonna be stuck as ghosts in misery on the Other Side. 
31009,Alexander," All right, you're done now. "
31010,Rebekah, I've got you. 
31011,Katherine," I don't think red's really your color, Bon-Bon. "
31012,Bonnie, And here I was hoping the ghost of anyone would've k*ll you already. 
31013,Katherine," Funny you should mention death, because I'm here to collect that immortality you've promised me. "
31014,Bonnie," Funny you still think you're going to get it. I told you, Qetsiyah's the only witch who knows the immortality spell. If she was a no-show, you're out of luck. "
31015,Katherine," See, here's the thing, Bonnie: I can't disagree with you, because I have been feeling out of luck lately. But you know who has been getting all of my luck? My beloved doppelgänger, Elena. My shadow-self is living a better life than I am, so if I don't get that immortality, I may just have to get rid of her altogether. "
31016,Bonnie, Did you just threaten my best friend? 
31017,Bonnie, I could crush your skull without even flinching. 
31018,Katherine, Go ahead. Make your move. 
31019,Elena, Hey. 
31020,Damon, Hey. 
31021,Elena," So, I think there's some stuff you and I need to talk about. "
31022,Damon," Yes, we do. But first-- [He walks over to his bedside table, opens a small chest and pulls out a box. Walking over to Elena, he presents her with the cure.] Consider it a graduation present. "
31023,Elena," Damon, I can't take that. "
31024,Damon, Sure you can. Looks like it might be cherry-flavored. 
31025,Elena, [laughing] I'm not saying I don't want it - obviously I want it. But... that's the only one. There's only one cure. And the hunters have made it pretty clear that they're willing to k*ll everyone in Mystic Falls until they get it. 
31026,Damon, Elena-- [he puts the cure into her hand and folds her fingers over it] --take the damn thing. I want you to take it. 
31027,Elena, I can't. 
31028,Damon," Well, I guess that answers the sire bond question. [The floor creaks. Damon looks over Elena's shoulder.] You gonna help a brother out, or are you just gonna lurk? "
31029,Jeremy," Look, Elena. You're my sister and I love you, no matter what you choose. "
31030,Damon," How is it even when you're dead, you're the bane of my existence? "
31031,Lexi," So, the veil's down until tonight, he dies and goes to the Other Side, and what? Comes back all over again? How long does that take? "
31032,Stefan," What, they don't give you a rulebook over there? "
31033,Lexi," [laughing] You know, you're missing your chance to weigh in on the Great Elena Gilbert Cure Debate. "
31034,Stefan," What am I supposed to do, tell her it's her choice? Because that worked out so well. You know, it's funny, those two are in there arguing about how to protect the world, and they have yet to address their biggest issue. "
31035,Lexi, Enlighten me. 
31036,Stefan, The sire bond's gone. Elena's emotions are back. She finally knows exactly how she feels. 
31037,Lexi, And what if whatever she feels is for you? 
31038,Stefan," She's the love of my life. I'd go back to her in a b*at. But, if that's not how she feels, then maybe that's exactly what I need to hear to get my ass out the door. Maybe I will move to Australia. I can live in a yurt. "
31039,Lexi, Cheers to that. 
31040,Damon," Come on, we don't need the cure for Silas - he's a calcified statue. "
31041,Elena, What was that? 
31042,Damon, Nothing. 
31043,Elena, Take off your shirt. 
31044,Damon," Elena, there are children present. "
31045,Elena, Fine. 
31046,Elena," Damon, why isn't this healed? "
31047,Damon," Because the b*llet was laced with werewolf venom, okay? The hunters are dicks. "
31048,Elena, We need Klaus. We need his bl*od. 
31049,Damon," Klaus would rather see me die. Plus, Klaus is a thousand miles away sipping Hurricanes on Bourbon Street. "
31050,Elena, That wound will k*ll you! 
31051,Jeremy, What about the cure? 
31052,Elena," Jeremy's right. If you're human, the werewolf venom won't hurt you. "
31053,Damon," And here I was, so moved by your speech to save mankind. [feigns listening] Sounds like Vaughn's awake. [He walks past Elena.] "
31054,Elena," Damon, wait. "
31055,Damon, Here. 
31056,Stefan, The hell are you doing? 
31057,Damon," Digging up Silas. [He turns and walks to the front door.] You coming, Vaughn, or not? "
31058,Damon, Here we are. 
31059,Vaughn, What is it? 
31060,Damon," It's where I dumped Silas. Closed off to hikers, no food for animals, endlessly deep water. "
31061,Vaughn," I'm not following you, Damon. Where exactly did you put the body? "
31062,Damon," Well, um... well, let me see. So I dragged his stone ass through here, I flung him in that general direction, then he tumbled down into those weeds... I kind of lost him in the rocks. The thing about physics... wait, what is it? It's, ah, distance equals velocity times time? Guess I should've told you to bring some scuba gear, huh? "
31063,Alexander, Don't you two look cozy? 
31064,Matt, So... he seems nice. 
31065,Rebekah, Don't make jokes - I'll laugh and you'll fall. 
31066,Matt," I'm wearing the Gilbert ring. I can't be k*ll by anything supernatural, so maybe if you're the one who detonates the b*mb, then I won't die. "
31067,Rebekah," Absolutely not. You'll blow into a billion pieces, the ring with it. "
31068,Matt, There's only one way to find out. 
31069,Rebekah," [nodding] Fine, okay. The first rule of truly living: do the thing you're most afraid of. "
31070,Matt, What are you doing? 
31071,Rebekah," I can't be k*ll and you can't miss graduation. Please, go. "
31072,Matt, No. 
31073,Rebekah, Run! 
31074,Alexander, What have you done? 
31075,Rebekah, I finally chose one of the good ones. 
31076,Elena, We have to do something. If those hunters give the cure to Silas-- 
31077,Stefan," They're not giving it to Silas. Wherever Damon is taking Vaughn right now, it's to stall, because Damon hasn't had time to bury Silas' body yet. [Elena stops pacing.] And that's all you need to know right now. "
31078,Elena," Okay, fine. We're stalling the hunters, but Damon is still dying. "
31079,Stefan," It was one b*llet, and it was only laced. We still have a little bit of time. I will go to New Orleans myself and I will beg Klaus if I have to. "
31080,Jeremy, Then it's settled. You're going to your graduation. [Jeremy enters the room carrying Elena's cap and gown.] 
31081,Elena," Gradua-- no, Jer, I never even sent in my college applications. "
31082,Jeremy, I don't care. Mom and Dad would k*ll you if there wasn't a photo of you in your graduation getup. 
31083,Elena," Jer, no. Not if you can't be there. "
31084,Jeremy, Lexi'll keep me company. You're going. 
31085,Elena, Let's go graduate. 
31086,Caroline," Klaus, now is not the time to decide that you are over me. I'm gonna call you every 10 minutes until you get your ass here to save Damon's life. "
31087,Caroline, Where is everyone? 
31088,Matt, [arriving suddenly] I'm here. 
31089,Caroline, Where have you been? 
31090,Matt," Oh, you know, making plans for the summer, dodging death by vampire hunter. "
31091,Bonnie, Where's Elena? We can't do this without her. 
31092,Elena, I'm here. [She hugs Bonnie.] Thank you for today. 
31093,Caroline," I can't believe it. We're actually all here. We are all here together! Bonnie Bennett, are you crying? "
31094,Bonnie, It's our last hurrah before you guys go off to college. 
31095,Caroline, Before we go off to college. 
31096,Elena," I... kinda sorta missed the deadline. You know, being an emotionless bitch. "
31097,Caroline," Well, the perks of being a vampire - we can go wherever we wanna go. We can choose our own roommates. We could - we could get a triple room! "
31098,Bonnie, I'm happy we're all here. 
31099,Caroline, Aw - group hug! 
31100,Stefan," Ah, I don't - I don't hug... "
31101,Caroline," Oh, get over yourself! "
31102,Hopkins," Welcome parents, family, and friends. What a beautiful day for a graduation. Thank you for joining us today on this special day, as we celebrate our graduates. So let's get started. John Albrecht. David Bance. Sarah Beasley. Um, not to play favorites, but I am especially proud of this next graduate, my lovely daughter: Bonnie Bennett! "
31103,Hopkins," Congratulations. I'm so proud of you, sweetie. "
31104,Bonnie," Thanks, Dad. "
31105,Hopkins, You're welcome. 
31106,Bonnie, For everything. 
31107,Hopkins, Savannah Davis. Matt Donovan. William Duncan. Caroline Forbes. Congratulations. 
31108,Caroline, Thank you. 
31109,Hopkins, Matt Freeman. Elena Gilbert. Congratulations. 
31110,Elena, Thank you. 
31111,Kol," Greetings, little witch. "
31112,Bonnie, [not looking at him] I thought Stefan got rid of you. 
31113,Kol," He did, and I spent the night crawling out of a cement grave. [He looks behind his row.] Isn't that the witch your friend Caroline k*ll? "
31114,Kol," And over there, that's my hybrid friend, Adrian. Also dead. In fact, these seats are scattered with two dozen supernatural faces, all of whom have reason to lash out since their lives were sacrificed in order to make your Expression triangle. All they're waiting on is word from me. "
31115,Bonnie, The veil goes back up tonight. Don't you have anything better to do than harrass me and my friends? 
31116,Kol," [laughing] Well, that's the thing. I don't want the veil to go back up. In fact, I want you to drop it completely, so I and my fallen friends can live, Bonnie. It's time to pay the piper. "
31117,Bonnie, The Kol I remember was adamantly against hell on earth. 
31118,Kol," I was, till I was in hell. Now I would very much like to be back on earth. "
31119,Kol, What's this? 
31120,Bonnie," It's me. I died last night. I'm a ghost, and I want the same thing you want. I don't want to be on the Other Side with unfinished business. I want my parents to see me off to college, I want to decorate my dorm room with my best friends. I want to stay here, Kol. More than anything. "
31121,Kol, Then what are we waiting for? Let's do it together. 
31122,Kol, What have you done? 
31123,Bonnie," This will hold you till dark. Then, when the veil is back up, this town will be rid of you for good. "
31124,Kol, But everything you just said-- 
31125,Bonnie," It was true. But we don't always get what we want, do we? "
31126,Damon," [imitating Vaughn's accent] What's wrong, laddie? Can't swim? "
31127,Vaughn, The hell happened to you? 
31128,Damon," [looking down] Oh. Well, would you look at that. That is nasty. "
31129,Vaughn," Connor... [He laughs, looking at his g*n.] He must've laced these b*ll*ts with werewolf venom. "
31130,Damon, Ding-ding-ding. Not as dumb as you sound. 
31131,Vaughn," This was all a lie, eh? You knew you were a dead man. [He pulls the cure, which is on a string about his neck, out from under his shirt.] Well, you don't get this back. Where'd you put Silas? "
31132,Vaughn," One more jolt of werewolf toxin, and you'll be dead within minutes. [shouting] Where's Silas? "
31133,Alaric, Oops. 
31134,Damon, [weakly] One slight problem. 
31135,Alaric, You mean this? 
31136,Damon," Yes. Yes, that. "
31137,Alaric," I would love nothing more than to get out of here before Vaughn comes back to life, but Damon won't take the cure. He wants it for Elena. "
31138,Stefan," Okay, just hang on a little longer. Caroline's calling Klaus again. "
31139,Alaric," Stefan, we are past the point of Hail Mary phone calls. What do you want me to do, stand here and watch him die, or force-feed him the cure? [Elena casts a significant look at Stefan, who remains silent.] Stefan? "
31140,Aja," Remember us, Caroline? "
31141,Klaus, There are plenty more of these to go around. Who's next? I can do this all day. 
31142,Damon, Hi. 
31143,Elena, Are you feeling better? 
31144,Damon, Yeah. 
31145,Elena, So it's all healed up? 
31146,Damon, Fresh as a daisy. 
31147,Elena, Good. 
31148,Lexi, Ouch. 
31149,Alaric," Yeah, I taught her that swing. "
31150,Stefan," You know it's not polite to eavesdrop, right? "
31151,Lexi," Hey, I'm short on time here. Don't rob me of what little joy I have. "
31152,Elena, Anyone seen Jeremy? 
31153,Alaric," Oh, he went to see Bonnie. He'll be back later. You know, before... well, you know. "
31154,Elena," Yeah. Stefan, can I, um... can I have a moment? "
31155,Stefan, Sure. 
31156,Lexi, This could get interesting. 
31157,Alaric, Usually does. 
31158,Lexi," So, the Other Side... Not exactly a party, is it? "
31159,Alaric, I've lived... better. 
31160,Lexi," You know there's something else out there, right? There has to be. Silas' whole agenda was to find peace with his one true love, and whatever 'peace' is... it's out there. I figure once we've served our time for all the bad things we've done, then it's just about letting go, moving on. "
31161,Alaric, And how are we supposed to do that when the knuckleheads we care about can't seem to keep their lives straight? 
31162,Lexi, Yeah... 
31163,Stefan," So, what's up? "
31164,Elena," Honestly, Stefan, I just wanted to thank you. For sticking by me when I was at my worst, for believing that I was still in there. Even after everything I put you through, you... you never gave up on me. "
31165,Stefan," I, ah... I kind of owed you one. "
31166,Elena, Here. 
31167,Elena, It's yours. I want you to have it. 
31168,Stefan," No, Elena, I'm not gonna-- "
31169,Elena," Stefan. The only person worse at being a vampire than me is you. Human bl*od is your downfall. You got the raw end of the vampire deal. The rest of us will be fine, we'll survive. I mean, you taught us. You deserve whatever you want out of life. [She folds his fingers over the cure.] You deserve this. "
31170,Caroline, How'd you get here so fast? 
31171,Klaus, I was already on my way. 
31172,Klaus," I received your graduation announcement. It was... very subtle. [Caroline shuts her eyes, smiling.] I assume you're expecting cash? "
31173,Caroline," That, or a mini fridge. "
31174,Klaus," Well, I had considered offering you a first class ticket to join me in New Orleans... but I knew what your answer would be. So, I opted for something I knew you would accept. [Caroline looks at him, waiting.] Tyler is now free to return to Mystic Falls. "
31175,Caroline, What? 
31176,Klaus," He's your first love. I intend to be your last, however long it takes. [He kisses her on the cheek.] Congratulations, Caroline. "
31177,Klaus," Let's get out of here, before 12 angry hybrids decide to pick a fight. "
31178,Damon, I wanted to apologize... 
31179,Elena, Good. 
31180,Damon," Let me finish. I said I wanted to. And then I realized, I'm not sorry. "
31181,Elena," You would rather die than be human, and you expect me to be okay with that? "
31182,Damon," I didn't say you were supposed to be okay with it, I just said I'm not sorry. But you know what I really am? Selfish, because I make bad choices that hurt you. Yes, I would rather have died than be human. I'd rather die right now than spend a handful of years with you, only to lose you when I'm too old and sick and miserable and you're still you. I'd rather die right now than spend my last final years remembering how good I had it and how happy I was, because that's who I am, Elena, and I'm not gonna change. And there's no apology in the world that encompasses all the reasons that I'm wrong for you. "
31183,Elena," Fine, then I'm not sorry either. I'm not sorry that I met you. I'm not sorry that knowing you has made me question everything, that in death you're the one that made me feel most alive. You've been a terrible person, you've made all the wrong choices, and of all the choices that I've made this will prove to be the worst one. But I am not sorry that I'm in love with you. I love you, Damon. I love y-- "
31184,Lexi, Now who's eavesdropping? 
31185,Damon, Stefan? 
31186,Stefan, Think the quarry will be deep enough to bury Silas? 
31187,Damon," Yeah, I don't think anyone's gonna stumble on him there. "
31188,Stefan, Yeah. 
31189,Damon," You want me to, ah-- "
31190,Stefan," No, it's all right. I got Lexi coming with me. "
31191,Damon, [under his breath] Yeah. 
31192,Stefan," Hey, Damon. "
31193,Damon, Yeah? 
31194,Stefan," I'm not happy about Elena... but I'm not not-happy for you, either. I just want you to know that. "
31195,Damon," Thanks, brother. "
31196,Jeremy, Hey. 
31197,Bonnie, Hey. 
31198,Jeremy, I needed to see you. 
31199,Bonnie," I need to close the veil, Jer. The hybrids, and the hunters-- "
31200,Jeremy, I get it. I'm ready. I just... wanted to be with you when it happened. 
31201,Bonnie, Did you and Elena...? 
31202,Jeremy, I can't. I can't say goodbye to her. We said 'no tears' and... I left her a letter. She'll find it when all this is over. I'm ready. 
31203,Alaric, Moon's full. 
31204,Damon, Yeah. 
31205,Alaric, Where's Elena? 
31206,Damon, She's trying to find Bonnie and Jeremy. She's worried about the time. 
31207,Damon, What? 
31208,Alaric," You got the girl, man. "
31209,Damon, [as though he still can't quite believe it] I got the girl. 
31210,Alaric, Now don't screw it up. 
31211,Damon," Well, with you looking over my shoulder, how can I? "
31212,Lexi, New York? 
31213,Stefan, Too close. 
31214,Lexi, Vegas! 
31215,Stefan," Ugh, no. Too touristy. "
31216,Lexi," Look, I know you think I'm joking, but you are leaving. You just graduated for the millionth time. It's time to start living your life. "
31217,Stefan, What if Elena was... the one? 
31218,Lexi," She was. And she will always be an epic love. Contrary to popular belief, there are actually multiple ones - especially for a vampire. The only way to find another is to let go, and move on. "
31219,Stefan, I've never been to Portland. 
31220,Stefan," See ya, Lexi. "
31221,Elena," Bonnie, Jer, are you guys here? "
31222,Kol," Well, well. "
31223,Kol, Speaking of unfinished business. 
31224,Katherine," Happy graduation, cupcake. "
31225,Bonnie, It's almost closed. 
31226,Jeremy," So this is it? 'Cause there were a million things I wanted to say to you, but now nothing seems quite right. "
31227,Bonnie, Then don't say anything. 
31228,Jeremy, What's happening? 
31229,Bonnie," Oh, my god. "
31230,Jeremy, What is it? 
31231,Bonnie," It worked, Jer. I did a spell that brought you back. I didn't think it would work, but I - I closed the veil and you're still... here. "
31232,Jeremy, I'm alive? 
31233,Jeremy," I can't feel your hand. What's going on, Bonnie? Why can't I feel you? "
31234,Bonnie, It's okay. 
31235,Jeremy," Bonnie, what did you do? "
31236,Bonnie," I have the witches, and my grams... You can see ghosts, we can talk whenever we want. "
31237,Jeremy," No... No! No, you can't be dead. "
31238,Bonnie, Do me this one favor: you tell Elena and Caroline that I'm spending the summer with my mom. 
31239,Jeremy, I can't. They need to know. 
31240,Bonnie," For the first time in forever, my friends are okay. I don't want to take that from them. "
31241,Bonnie," I'm gonna be okay, I promise. "
31242,Matt, Hey... What are you doing here? 
31243,Rebekah, I just wanted to see if you were okay. Rough day and whatnot. 
31244,Matt," Thanks. Look, I'd invite you in, but I promised Tyler I was gonna keep this a low-vampire zone. "
31245,Rebekah," I know that we were under duress today, so... whatever, you know, plans that we were making... I understand if you don't want to. "
31246,Matt," You and I... this isn't gonna work. I need to keep my love life a low-vampire zone, too, okay? "
31247,Rebekah, [smiling] Of course. I get it. 
31248,Matt," So whatever happens on the road, stays on the road, all right? [Rebekah, grinning, turns back round.] That little wedding town in Italy? Don't get any ideas about turning me into a vampire so that we can live eternally ever after, you know what I mean? "
31249,Rebekah," I'm sorry, are you saying...? "
31250,Matt," I've never set one foot outside of this town. I have no college plans, no idea what the future holds for me... But I do know that it's time that I start truly living. And, since you almost k*ll me this year, I figured it's your obligation to show me how. "
31251,Rebekah, [grinning] Okay. 
31252,Elena, What are you doing? 
31253,Katherine, Would you believe I'm having a bad day? 
31254,Katherine, It started when Bonnie denied me my Silas-like immortality. 
31255,Elena," Of course, because Katherine Pierce can't be happy with good old vampire-caliber immortality. "
31256,Katherine," I deserved it. I never had a graduation, or a prom, or, you know, a life. But you did. "
31257,Katherine," You have everything, and it's not because you're a good little girl who deserves happiness, it's because you stole mine. "
31258,Elena, I stole your happiness? You k*ll my brother! 
31259,Katherine," I'll admit, that was nasty. "
31260,Katherine, I have nothing. [She b*at Elena with the stick.] But I'm about to change that. [She kicks Elena.] 
31261,Elena," Kicking someone while they're down... classy till the end, Katherine. "
31262,Katherine, [laughing] Your end. 
31263,Elena, You deserve whatever you want out of life. You deserve this. 
31264,Stefan," Listen... I'm glad you're okay with who you are now. But every single thing I did to get this, I did for you, so that the choice of whether you wanted to be a vampire or not would always be yours. "
31265,Katherine," Bye-bye, little girl. "
31266,Elena," Have a nice human life, Katherine. "
31267,Elena/Silas, Don't bother. I'm not there. 
31268,Stefan," Silas. You were stone. They saw you, the spell worked. "
31269,Elena/Silas," That's the funny thing about spells - they're bound by Nature. Nature demands balance, so every spell has a loophole. The spell that turned me into stone was bound by a witch - a living witch. So when that witch died, the spell broke. "
31270,Stefan, Bonnie? Bonnie's not dead. 
31271,Elena/Silas," It doesn't matter, does it? And here's where the mystery of me comes full circle. I created the immortality spell two thousand years ago. I can never die, so Nature needed to find a balance - a version of me that could die. A shadow-self - a doppelgänger. "
31272,Stefan," So, this is finally your real face? You're another one of them? "
31273,Elena/Silas, Not exactly. 
31274,Silas," Hello, my shadow-self. "
31275,Silas, Do you have any idea what it's like to starve for two thousand years?

31277,Stefan voice-over, Love brought me to Mystic Falls.
31278,Elena voice-over, Love drove me away.
31279,Elena voice-over," I am not sorry that I am in love with you, Damon."
31280,Bonnie voice-over, I did a spell that brought you back. You can see ghosts. We can talk.
31281,Jeremy voice-over," No, you can't be dead."
31282,Elena voice-over," Have a nice human life, Katherine. But our greatest threat is still out there."
31283,Man, Ooh!
31284,Silas voice-over, And he looks just... Like... Me.
31285,"Elena, voice-over"," Hey, Bonnie. How is the summer almost over, and yet I feel like I got nothing done?"
31286,"Elena, voice-over", Sounds like you're having fun traveling with your mom. I still don't know how I'm supposed to do this whole college thing without you.
31287,"Elena, voice-over", And Caroline agrees. She spent the summer designing the color palette for her dorm room while Tyler's been away helping some wolf pack in Tennessee. 
31288,"Caroline, on phone"," Don't worry. I already sent them your application, Tyler. All you have to do is register for classes and show up."
31289,"Elena, voice-over"," Matt and Rebekah have been sending postcards. I think that they're in Amsterdam now, or was it Prague? I can't keep track. And honestly, I'm not sure I really want to."
31290,"Elena, voice-over"," Anyway, I can't wait to see you. When do you get back? Love, Elena."
31291,Jeremy, Dear Elena.
31292,Bonnie," Wait. Don't start with ""dear."""
31293,Jeremy, It's bad enough you're dead. Now you're a control freak?
31294,Bonnie," I'm just saying. People don't say ""dear"" anymore."
31295,Jeremy," Fine. How about ""hey, Elena, what's up?""?"
31296,Bonnie, Thank you.
31297,"Bonnie, voice-over"," Hey, Elena. What's up? You guys have no idea how much I miss you. I've been e-mailing with Jeremy. He says it's been surreal to be alive."
31298,Elena," Hey, um, sor... I thought you left."
31299,Jeremy," I did. Uh, 5 hours ago."
31300,Elena," Well, there's... there's pizza in the fr..."
31301,"Bonnie, voice-over", If Katherine ingesting the only cure on this earth and having to live as a human isn't justice...
31302,"Bonnie, voice-over", I don't know what is. I miss you guys. I'm glad you're having a great summer. P.S. Have you heard from Stefan?
31303,Damon, You ok?
31304,Elena," Yeah. I've just got this weird feeling, like something bad's about to happen."
31305,Damon," Well, it is.. You're leaving tomorrow. You're trading all this for communal showers and a meal plan."
31306,Elena, Can't you just be a normal boyfriend and support me as I attempt to have a normal college experience?
31307,Damon, I'd rather ply you with champagne and spend the night convincing you to stay.
31308,Jeremy," There were issues at home. Ever since I lost my parents and my aunt, I've been acting out. Drugs, drinking. I was looking for attention, so, I lit my house on fire and faked my own death."
31309,Elena," Really stress the drug thing, and I'd definitely say that the fire was an accident, because there's crazy and then there's... Well... Me."
31310,Jeremy," Or I could just not go back, considering my school already had a memorial for me."
31311,Damon, Caroline just pulled up.
31312,Elena, I... I can't leave. I should stay and at least wait until Jeremy settles into school.
31313,Damon, You're leaving. You're going to college. You're gonna drink cheap beer and you're gonna protest things you don't care about. And I am gonna take care of your little brother. Trust me. You have nothing to worry about.
31314,Elena," Ok, well, at least Whitmore is only a few hours away, so, if there's anything you need, Jer, just call me."
31315,Elena," So, how do you think this whole long-distance thing is gonna work?"
31316,Damon," Well, I personally plan on forgetting about you the second you walk out the door."
31317,Elena, I love you.
31318,Damon, And I love you. All right. Off you go.
31319,Damon (to Jeremy)," Yeah, no. We're not doing this. Go to school."
31320,Caroline, You're dreaming about Stefan?
31321,Elena, They're not dreams. It's more of a feeling. Maybe I should call him.
31322,Caroline, So he can hear how happy you are with Damon? Absolutely not. He'll call you when he's ready.
31323,Elena," So, I should just live with this nagging pit in my stomach?"
31324,Caroline," Ok, Elena, that pit is called guilt. You feel terrible because you broke Stefan's heart, and that nagging feeling is your brain waking up to tell you that you've made a horrible yet completely reversible mistake."
31325,Elena," Nice try. Besides, Stefan and I left things in a good place."
31326,Caroline, It doesn't mean he hasn't been thinking about you shacking up with his brother all summer long.
31327,Liz, Hello. Mom ears. Still here.
31328,Elena," We're in college, Caroline."
31329,Caroline, We actually made it. We're here.
31330,Bonnie, We're all here together.
31331,Caroline, You brought a panini press?
31332,Liz," All right. Give me a good-bye hug before I change my mind and drag you home with me. Oh. You can call as much as you want, you know?"
31333,Caroline," Mom, I'll be fine."
31334,Liz," Come here. This is where your dad fell in love with medicine, you know? He would be really proud"
31335,Elena, Thank you.
31336,Caroline," Ok, go! Before I change my mind and make you stay."
31337,Liz," I'm going. I'm going. I love you. Bye, girls."
31338,Caroline," So, roomie, I think we should drink to something."
31339,Elena," I couldn't agree more. Roomie. Ha ha! To us, and college, and being functional vampires. To the next chapter of our life."
31340,Megan, Hi!
31341,Caroline," Uh, who are you?"
31342,Megan, I'm Megan. Your roommate.
31343,Bonnie, Tell her I'm at the Grand Canyon.
31344,Jeremy," You realize you're just postponing the inevitable, right? What happens when your dad finds out you've been dead all summer?"
31345,Bonnie, How many postcards have I sent him? How many times has he called? I've done enough. He's clearly not missing me.
31346,Jeremy, What about Elena?
31347,Bonnie," I just saw her at college. She seemed genuinely happy. I am not taking that away from her. We're lucky, Jer. How many people die and still get to talk to their best friends?"
31348,Jeremy, How many best friends can't feel each other? I should get going. The freak who faked his own death can't also be late for math.
31349,Damon, Wait a minute. How did that happen?
31350,Elena, There must have been a mix-up at the housing office.
31351,Damon, Compulsion. It's the ultimate unwanted roommate repellent.
31352,Elena, That's exactly what Caroline said.
31353,Damon," Right. So, then just compel her ass out the door."
31354,Elena," Damon, what's the point in going to college if we're just gonna recreate what happened in Mystic Falls?"
31355,Damon," Look at you, giving it the old college try."
31356,Elena, Did Jeremy get to school ok?
31357,Damon," Yup. Showered, groomed, even cut the crust off of his PB&J myself."
31358,Elena," So, what you're saying is that me being here, you being there, this could actually work."
31359,Damon," Exactly. Heh. Listen, I gotta... Go."
31360,Katherine," It's been a long summer, Damon."
31361,Damon, Katherine.
31362,Matt, 5-star restaurants in Paris to tapping kegs in a park.
31363,Rebekah, Tragic.
31364,Matt, I thought we said no strings.
31365,Rebekah, Who said there were strings?
31366,Matt, Weren't you leaving town?
31367,Rebekah, I thought I'd give you one last chance to come with me.
31368,Matt, I have to work. I'm back in the real world now. I need a paycheck.
31369,Rebekah, Great. Maybe you could replace those earrings that street rat Nadia stole in Prague.
31370,Matt, Those earrings don't bring you back to life. How am I gonna explain to Jeremy that she stole his Gilbert ring?
31371,Rebekah," Tell him you had a threesome. He'll understand. Don't call. (kissing) Don't write. (kissing) And whatever you do, don't you dare miss me. (kissing)"
31372,Liz, Hey. Look who's back.
31373,Silas," Look who's, uh, eating her feelings."
31374,Liz, Yeah. I just dropped the girls off at Whitmore.
31375,Liz, Ahh. What are you doing?
31376,Silas, I'm outing myself as not-Stefan. Obviously.(cutting her wrist) Don't be afraid. Don't move.
31377,Liz, What's happening?
31378,Silas," We've met before, actually, when I was appearing as your daughter? To bash your head in? Does that ring any bells?"
31379,Liz, Silas.
31380,Silas," Indeed. I am a 2,000- year-old immortal that Caroline and her friends thought they got rid of."
31381,Liz, Are you appearing to me as Stefan?
31382,Silas," Well, yes and no. This is my true form. Stefan is my doppelganger. You're confused. I know that because I can read your thoughts. It's understandable. I mean, I've been a little cryptic lately."
31383,Liz, What's with the kn*fe? Most vampires go straight for the neck.
31384,Silas," Oh, please, Liz. I came first. Vampires are nothing more than a disgusting perversion of me. I'm k*ll, I'm immortal, and I'm psychic, and to function, I need human bl*od, but don't ever call me a vampire. Cheers. Ahh."
31385,Silas," Unfortunately, I can see that you can't help me find what I'm looking for, so, all you need to remember, Liz... Is that Stefan stopped by to say hello."
31386,Liz," Call your friends, Stefan. Let them know you're ok."
31387,Silas," Will do, sheriff."
31388,Megan," So, your current boyfriend Damien..."
31389,Megan," but 3 months ago, he left without saying good-bye?"
31390,Elena, Do you think I should call him?
31391,Megan," Do you have a boyfriend, Caroline?"
31392,Caroline," I do. His name's Tyler. He had to miss move-in day, but he'll be here for the first day of classes."
31393,Elena," Assuming he registers, and picks a dorm, and buys books."
31394,Caroline," Speaking of minding one's own business, let's talk roommate ground rules."
31395,Caroline," I have low bl*od sugar. My diet's finicky, so, keep your paws off my stuff."
31396,Megan, We'll split up the shelves.
31397,Caroline," And if I suddenly get up to leave or disappear for a while, don't follow me or look for me."
31398,Megan, Ok. Sounds good.
31399,Elena, Ha! Great. Then we agree on everything.
31400,Man," Excuse me, ladies. Party at Whitmore house tonight."
31401,Elena, We'll be there.
31402,Man, I hope so.
31403,Elena, I love college.
31404,Damon, Look who rose from the dead.
31405,Katherine, Nice phone. Does it ever ring?
31406,Katherine, You're gonna have to cut me off soon. My tolerance is a joke now. It's just so... Glorious.
31407,Damon, You're miserable.
31408,Katherine, Please. I'm Katherine Pierce.
31409,Damon," Your hair is messed up. Your nails have chipped. You're a sad, miserable human being, and you want me to turn you. So, here. Go ahead. Drink up. I'll k*ll you. You'll bite the mailman and you'll be a vampire again. Go ahead. Come on."
31410,Katherine," I can't, ok? No one's ever taken the cure before. If I die, there's a good chance I may never wake up."
31411,Damon, And that would be tragic.
31412,Katherine," And deep down, in that mushy-gushy Elena-loving heart, there's a part of you that doesn't want me to die."
31413,Damon," What are you doing here, Katherine?"
31414,Katherine," Salvatore residence. Hello, principal Weber. This is Elena. Oh, dear. We'll find him."
31415,Katherine," So, Jeremy's been expelled. Elena will be cool with that, right?"
31416,Damon," When I get back here, you're going."
31417,Katherine," Wait, Damon. There's someone chasing me."
31418,Damon, Then run. Run far away.
31419,Katherine," Damon, you don't understand. I have enemies everywhere. What happens when word gets out that I am a human? I can't protect myself. I'm weak. And I'm slow. Do you have any idea what it's like to run in heels? I have blisters, Damon. Please, just... Help me."
31420,Damon, Wish I could say it gets better.
31421,Stefan," The answer's no, Damon."
31422,Damon, Why? So you can keep dying and coming back to life? You felt nothing but sheer agony for 3 months. You hallucinate conversations with me to have something to do. Just turn off that pesky humanity switch.
31423,Stefan, It won't take the pain away.
31424,Damon," Yeah, but it'll turn off your misery. Your fear. Your hopelessness."
31425,Stefan," And then what, huh? Let's just say that you actually notice I'm gone. Let's say I get out of this. What good is it if I'm a monster again? How is that better than any of this?"
31426,Caroline, Did you notice how Megan's juicer takes up all the small appliance space? She has an entire drawer
31427,Elena, What happened to privacy?
31428,Caroline," Maybe if she didn't take such long showers, I wouldn't have time to go through her stuff. How are you ok with a third roommate?"
31429,Elena, Because we're trying to be functional. And being functional means we need friends.
31430,Caroline," We also need personal space. I mean, what if we suddenly get a craving and I want to eat her? Or our bl*od bags go bad because we can't store them in the mini-fridge? [Scoffs] And what the hell is protein water? You know what? Maybe if I drink it all, she'll want to move out."
31431,Elena," Caroline, no..."
31432,Caroline, Vervain.
31433,Megan, What's going on? Are you ok?
31434,Elena," Yeah, she's... she's fine."
31435,Megan, What happened?
31436,Caroline," Water just went down the wrong pipe. I'm ok, really. I shouldn't have touched your stuff. I'm... I'm really sorry."
31437,Megan," It's fine. Just sounded like someone was dying out here. Ah. Well, I'm glad you're ok."
31438,Caroline, She knows who we are. She drinks vervain water.
31439,Elena, That doesn't mean that she knows about us.
31440,Caroline, Seriously? We share a bathroom with this girl. What if she's a hunter and she stakes us when we're in the shower? Or she steals our daylight rings while we're asleep and then we burst into flames when the sun comes up?
31441,Elena," Don't you think that if she was a hunter, we'd be dead by now?"
31442,Caroline," I think we should lock her up. You know, let the vervain get out of her system, and then we compel her to forget about us."
31443,Elena," Caroline, I'm not kidnapping our roommate. The best way to convince her that we're normal is to act normal. Do normal, human, freshman-y stuff."
31444,Caroline, Such as?
31445,Man," Hey, I remember you."
31446,Elena, Hey. Flyer guy.
31447,Elena, I'm Elena. This is Caroline.
31448,Jesse, Nice to meet you.
31449,Caroline, Hi.
31450,Elena, You can't be nice to the guy?
31451,Caroline, I'm with Tyler.
31452,Elena, Are you? Because he hasn't called.
31453,Caroline, From the mountains of Appalachia?
31454,Elena, I'm just saying I don't want you to get your hopes up thinking that he's coming when he hasn't really shown much interest.
31455,Caroline, Did you tell Damon that you're having dreams about Stefan? See? No relationship is perfect. What the hell?
31456,Elena, Someone must own this place.
31457,Jesse, Hey. I was wondering if you guys were gonna make it. You guys going in or...
31458,Megan, Why are you guys just standing there?
31459,Elena, We were just... Caroline?
31460,Caroline, Waiting for someone.
31461,Elena, So...
31462,Megan," Right. Well, I'm gonna go hang."
31463,Caroline," Like I said, she knows."
31464,Damon, One day. One day where you don't screw it up.
31465,Jeremy," Leave me alone, Damon."
31466,Damon, You're lucky you didn't put one of those idiots in ICU.
31467,Jeremy, Says the guy that once k*ll me.
31468,Damon," Yes. In the privacy of your own home, away from prying eyes, unlike you, who went all hunter in the middle of a hallway. You got expelled, genius."
31469,Jeremy, Does that mean I don't have to go back to school?
31470,Damon, I compelled principal Weber into a very generous three--day suspension. Elena does not need to know about this. Finish eating. Meet me outside.
31471,Silas," Hello, Damon."
31472,Damon, Stefan. Welcome home.
31473,Silas, Thanks.
31474,Elena," Hey. Megan. It's Elena. Just calling to let you know why we left, so, call me when you get a chance. Bye."
31475,Caroline," Ok. It's settled. When she leaves, we grab her."
31476,Elena, Or we could just let her know that you weren't feeling well.
31477,Caroline," Elena, she saw us stuck at the threshold. We might as well have flashed her our fangs. There's no way that out of the thousands of freshmen we were randomly paired with someone who knows about vampires."
31478,Elena, Maybe it wasn't random.
31479,Elena," Hey, Megan."
31480,Megan," Elena, you have to help me. He's chasing me! Megan, who's chasing you?"
31481,Megan," Help me! Oh, my God..."
31482,Elena, We can't come inside. The line's too long. If you come out... where are you?
31483,Megan," Elena, please help me!"
31484,Caroline," Megan, can you hear me?"
31485,Elena, Get outside and we can help you.
31486,Caroline, Who did this to her?
31487,Elena, This was a vampire.
31488,Damon," Look, I get why you haven't called me back all summer. I wouldn't call me back, either."
31489,Silas, You mean because you stole my girlfriend? I'm over it.
31490,Silas, Katherine's living at Chateau Salvatore.
31491,Damon, How do you know that?
31492,Silas, Because I can read your mind. Kidding buddy. Katherine called me first. Remember? It's always been me first.
31493,Damon, Right.
31494,Silas," Hey, Jeremy, looking good, man."
31495,Jeremy," Hey, Stefan. Glad you're back."
31496,Silas," All right, I'll see you at home."
31497,Damon, Great.
31498,Jeremy," Something's wrong. When he touched me, I felt a chill where my tattoo was."
31499,Damon, What are you talking about?
31500,Jeremy," Right before I died, Silas grabbed me and I felt the same thing."
31501,Damon," Silas is gone. Bonnie turned him into a big piece of rock, remember?"
31502,Bonnie," I died. Jeremy, I bound the magic that took down Silas. When I died, the spell must have broken. He's free. That was Silas."
31503,Damon, That's impossible.
31504,Jeremy," I'm a hunter. Our whole reason for existing is to k*ll him. I know what I'm feeling, Damon. That... that was Silas."
31505,Damon, I just watched him walk through a crowd of people that saw Stefan. There's no way he could fool that many people at once. He's psychic but no one's that psychic.
31506,Jeremy, What did he want?
31507,Silas, Why are you in my brother's bathtub?
31508,Katherine, Why aren't you?
31509,Silas, I will say that's a tempting offer.
31510,Katherine, Mm. He flirts. I like Elenaless Stefan.
31511,Silas," You know, human looks better on you than I would've guessed, Katherine."
31512,Katherine, I think you just accidentally gave me a compliment. 
31513,Silas," No, I mean it. You sitting here all weak and vulnerable. It works."
31514,Silas, Time for a field trip.
31515,Damon (to Jeremy), Get her out of here. Don't tell me where you're going.
31516,Damon," God, you're slow. Guess vamp speed came with the upgrade."
31517,Silas, Get out of my way and give me Katherine.
31518,Damon, First drop the Stefan look.
31519,Silas, What?
31520,Elena," What is happening? Our roommate is dead, there's a vampire at the party. We don't know what she knew or who she told."
31521,Caroline, We should get out of here.
31522,Elena, Caroline. I left that message in her voicemail.
31523,Caroline, Don't worry. I took her phone.
31524,Elena, You what?
31525,Elena," I mean, I think so."
31526,Damon," If I have to hear the word ""doppelganger"" ""one more time, I think I'm gonna actually have to learn how to spell it."
31527,Silas, You say you don't believe me and yet your mind is spinning at the possibility.
31528,Damon," ""A,"" get out of my head. ""B,"" I think I'd know if my little brother had an evil twin."
31529,Silas," Oh, we're not twins. See, when I became truly immortal, nature retaliated by creating a version of me that was k*ll. It's called a shadow self."
31530,Damon," Well, whatever you are, your plan didn't work. Cure's gone. Now, what do you want with Katherine?"
31531,Silas," I could tell you, but wouldn't it be so much more fun if it were a surprise?"
31532,Damon, You're not getting her.
31533,Silas," Damon, how well do you know your brother? Do you really think he would leave town for 3 months without so much as a phone call so you could live happily ever after with the love of his life? Or did you just delude yourself into thinking it would be that easy?"
31534,Silas," So, call the hunter. Bring me Katherine. And then I will tell you where your little brother is."
31535,Katherine, Where are we going? Are you deaf? I said where are we going?
31536,Jeremy, Hey.
31537,Damon, How far did you get?
31538,Jeremy, You said not to tell you.
31539,Damon, You picked now to listen to me?
31540,Jeremy, We just passed old Miller road.
31541,Damon, Good. Turn around. Bring her back.
31542,Katherine, What? No.
31543,Katherine," What are you doing? Jeremy, stop. You can't take me back there, Jeremy. Damon wouldn't just hand me over. Silas clearly got in his head."
31544,Jeremy," Shut up, Katherine. Hey, what the hell?"
31545,Silas, Ooh. Your thoughts are churning. It's like a spool of pink Taffy. It's very messy but very fun to watch.
31546,Damon, Anyone ever tell you that's creepy?
31547,Silas, You're worried. Jeremy's not answering the phone. [Gasp] They should be back by now. You think something's very wrong.
31548,Matt," There you go, mayor. This one's on the house."
31549,Mayor," Thank you, Matt. "
31550,Matt," So, when's Bonnie coming back?"
31551,Mayor," Well, I'm not sure, but if you talk to her, tell her I said hi, ok? Thanks for the beer."
31552,Matt, You're welcome. No way. Nadia?
31553,Nadia, You remember me.
31554,Matt, Yeah. I remember you. You got Rebekah and me drunk and robbed us.
31555,Nadia," But it was fun until then, no?"
31556,Matt, How did you know how to find me?
31557,Nadia, Let's skip the how and get to the why. This wasn't mine to take.
31558,Matt," You traveled 4,000 miles to give me back a ring?"
31559,Matt, I want it.
31560,Nadia," Looks better on you, anyway."
31561,Elena on phone," Hey, Megan, it's Elena. Just calling to let you know..."
31562,Elena, Megan's tablet's gone.
31563,Caroline, Along with her so-called su1c1de note?
31564,Elena, Can I see the phone for a second?
31565,Caroline," It just doesn't make any sense. First the roommate we're not supposed to have might know about vampires, and then happens to be k*ll by a vampire and now the school's covering it up? Seriously, who is this girl?"
31566,Elena," Whatever's going on, it's not just about our roommate. It's about me. That's Megan. With my dad."
31567,Bonnie," Jeremy, hold on. Hey, I know you can hear me. Jeremy."
31568,Damon," Jeremy. Aah! Open your eyes, Jer. You do not get to die on me. You hear me? I'm supposed to be taking care of you, you little punk. Wake up. I'll k*ll you myself. Uhh."
31569,Jeremy, Katherine is gone.
31570,Damon, [Exhales] Oh. [Exhales] I don't care. [Exhales]
31571,Tyler on phone," Hey, Caroline, look. I put a lot of thought into this and decided to defer school for now. This werewolf pack I'm helping, they need me. I know it's lame to do this over the phone, but I figure this way's harder for you to k*ll me. I'm really, really sorry, take care, but this is important."
31572,Elena, You ok?
31573,Caroline," Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine."
31574,Elena," Sorry, Caroline."
31575,Caroline, I'm really glad that you're here.
31576,Elena," I'm really glad you're here, too."
31577,Damon," You're thinking about it. Flip the switch, brother. Put yourself out of this misery, please."
31578,Stefan, Did you forget how long it took me to come back last time? Everything I lost in the process?
31579,Damon," You don't deserve this, Stefan. You did the right thing... you walked away. You let us be happy, and this is what you get in return? How is that fair? Hey. Just turn it off. Turn it off."
31580,Elena," Wait. Stay with me, Stefan."
31581,Stefan, What are you doing here?
31582,Elena," I know this is torture, but stay with me. Your humanity is the one thing that makes you who you are. Don't let go. Please, Stefan. For me."
31583,Damon," Hey, sorry it took so long to call you back. Car trouble."
31584,Elena, What happened?
31585,Damon," Well, some idiot broke the window. Based on your voicemail, it sounds like your day sucked worse than mine. You all right? Do you want to come home?"
31586,Elena, I can't. Especially if my dad's connected to this somehow. I need to know why.
31587,Damon," Yeah, it's probably for the best. That'll give me more bonding time with your brother."
31588,Elena," I love you, Damon."
31589,Damon, Good night.
31590,Jeremy, You didn't tell her Silas was here.
31591,Damon," Nor did I tell her Stefan's missing, Katherine's in town, or you got expelled."
31592,Jeremy," So, you lied."
31593,Damon, No. I withheld a bit of the truth so that Elena wouldn't drop everything and come running home to help. I'll figure all this out.
31594,Mayor, I hope everyone enjoyed the party.
31595,Mayor, It is... it is truly great to have an end-of-summer tradition. My daughter has her own end-of-summer tradition of overindulging in the cotton candy.
31596,Silas, Do you mind if I say a few words?
31597,Mayor," Maybe when we're done here, ok?"
31598,Silas," I'll take it from here, mayor."
31599,Bonnie," Oh, my God."
31600,Silas," You're probably wondering how I did that. It's pretty basic mind control. And until now, it's been fairly limited to one person at a time. But this summer, I've consumed an immeasurable amount of bl*od."
31601,Silas," And I felt myself getting stronger and stronger every day. And I started to wonder, what are the limits to my powers? How many people can I influence? Two? Ten? An entire town square?"
31602,Silas, Everyone stop talking. That worked. Now let's try this. No one make a sound or move a muscle.
31603,Silas," Now that I have your attention, I need a favor. I need you to find someone. You all know Elena Gilbert. Well, the girl that I'm looking for looks exactly like her."
31604,Bonnie, It was supposed to be a nice family event. Just stopped in to see my dad. Then Silas showed up. He said he was testing how powerful his mind control had become
31605,Silas, Nobody make a sound or move a muscle 
31606,Bonnie," The entire town did exactly what he said. He didn't want any witnesses, so he told them to forget what he did. They watched my dad die, and they couldn't do anything or tell anyone. What are you gonna do? You gonna hug me?"
31607,Jeremy, I want to
31608,Bonnie," But you can’t. You can't touch me, and I can't touch you because I'm dead just like my dad except he's not supernatural, so I don't get to see him on the other side. He's just dead. Silas is using his mind control to find Katherine. He told everyone in the town square to keep an eye out for anyone that looks like Elena. Whatever he wants with Katherine... We can't let him have it"
31609,Woman," You ok, hun? You're gonna get yourself sick out here"
31610,Katherine, Thank you so much for stopping
31611,Woman, You ok just like Elena Gilbert
31612,Katherine," Actually, I'm much prettier"
31613,Woman," Katherine Pierce, right? I'm supposed to be keeping my eye out for you"
31614,Katherine, Damn it! Unh!
31615,Matt," Hurts, doesn't it? Not as much as this will"
31616,Elena," We could be doing anything right now, Stefan, be anywhere. Why here, why this?"
31617,Stefan," These are the good moments, the simple ones, the ones that matter. These are the moments that keep me from falling apart"
31618,Elena, This can't last forever. You're just distracting yourself
31619,Stefan," Elena, Elena, Elena. Elena! No"
31620,Elena, Megan's memorial outside is growing by the minute
31621,Caroline," Ugh. College kids are so dramatic. She was on campus for, like, one day. She couldn't have made that many friends"
31622,Elena," Caroline, she's dead. You can stop competing with her"
31623,Caroline, Sorry. I'm in a mood
31624,Elena, You talked to Tyler?
31625,Caroline," He's deferring from enrolling and deferring from returning my phone calls, so I'm deferring from having sex with him ever again"
31626,Elena, How's the snooping going? Any explanation why our Vervain-laced... Vampire-slaughtered roommate had a picture of my dad on her phone?
31627,Caroline, No
31628,Elena, Oh! I went by the hospital this morning. Megan’s death certificate. It says she died of su1c1de. No mention of the gaping vampire bites on her neck. So whoever signed off on the cause of death was part of the cover-up just like the Founders Council back home
31629,Caroline, Dr. Wesley Maxfield
31630,Elena, AKA our applied microbiology T.A. I switched our classes around so that we can…
31631,Caroline," applied what… what? Uh, Elena, we are supposed to be taking intro to communication. What happened to getting drunk and making bad decisions about boys? What happened to our fun freshman year at college? I am supposed to be a drama major!"
31632,Elena," You're not going to be an anything major if we get exposed as vampires! We are still gonna have our fun year, Caroline, but we have to protect ourselves. The way Damon kept his secret in Mystic Falls was because he infiltrated the Founders Council. So bust out those alleged acting k*ll, and let's get on it, ok?"
31633,Liz," Damon, I know I said I'd help you find your brother, but I can't dredge the entire quarry. It's enormous"
31634,Damon," I'm aware of that. I mean, clearly that's why we wanted to dump Silas' body here because it's big and deep and no one would find him. Now say I'm Silas and I want to take over my doppelganger's life, why wouldn't I dump him in a place that's big and deep where no one would find him?"
31635,Liz," Damon, I already agreed to hold off on telling anyone about the mayor's death until you figure this all out, but I can't devote those kinds of resources to finding one person who may or may not be down there"
31636,Damon," But it's a place to start, and if Stefan's down there, it means he's been drowning over and over again all summer while I've been happily playing house with Elena. Do I need to further elaborate the source of my urgency?"
31637,Liz, I'll get some deputies on it
31638,Damon," Thank you, Liz"
31639,Damon, Please tell me you found her
31640,Jeremy," I didn't, but Matt did"
31641,Damon, Huh. How shockingly useful
31642,Katherine," Those blue eyes, they made me soft. I should have ripped your head off when I had the chance"
31643,Jeremy, She was mid cat fight with some lady who maced her. We think Silas might have mind-controlled himself some new friends
31644,Damon," How exactly did the Gilbert and Donovan brain trust put all that together? Never mind. Doesn't matter. Just hide her. If Silas wants her bad enough, to sic the whole town on her, that means we want her more. Stay out of sight. You're the last person Silas saw her with"
31645,Katherine, Are these ropes really necessary?
31646,Jeremy," b*llet would have been more effective, but we're trying to be nice. You crashed my car and left me to die"
31647,Katherine, You were gonna hand me over to Silas to get Stefan back. I was just protecting myself
31648,Matt, How many people you k*ll using that excuse? Just be glad we got you some clothes
31649,Katherine, Don't play the hero. You two are just waiting for the convenient time to hand me back over to him. I've done this a thousand times. I get it. I'm the leverage. I'm that thing that everybody wants. I'm the freaking Moonstone
31650,Jesse, Hey. Blow-off girl. Aren't you a freshman? How are you in this class?
31651,Caroline," What? Um, I love applied...Micro...Biology. It's like my favorite biology. You know, little things are just so cute!"
31652,Jesse," Are you going to the bonfire tonight, or are you just gonna get really close and then turn around and leave again?"
31653,Elena, She'll be there
31654,Jesse, Sweet. We'll hang
31655,Elena," What? You said you wanted to make bad decisions about boys. He's cute, he's interested, and most importantly, unlike Tyler, he's here"
31656,1.," Morning, everyone. I'm Dr. Maxfield. First name is Wes, but call me Dr. Maxfield. One day when you're out of med school, you'll understand. So you're all going to this bonfire tonight, right? Well, here's a quick history lesson for you. Whitmore was founded as a hospital during the Civil w*r, deadliest w*r in American history, over 600,000 casualties. Disease was so prevalent that once a week they had to gather all the dead, rotting bodies, put them in a pile, and light the whole thing on fire. So tonight when you're getting drunk and partying, stop for a second, close your eyes, and imagine the rancid smell of a hundred rotting corpses"
31657,Caroline, (whispering): Creep-y
31658,1., Which brings us to microbiology...
31659,Elena (whispering), But hott-ie
31660,1., Because that rancid smell comes from a very specific bacteria
31661,Elena, He is
31662,1.," Isn't that right, chatty girls in the back?And what is that bacteria?"
31663,Elena," Uh, that's the, uh… um, I don't know"
31664,1.," Maybe because you're freshmen who shouldn't be in this class. How do I know? I'm observant, a k*ll you'll learn in Bio 101 down the hall"
31665,Elena, It was mortifying. We just sat there in silence
31666,Damon, You want me to b*at him up?
31667,Elena," Not yet. Whatever he knows, I'm gonna get it out of him"
31668,Damon, Did you compel him?
31669,Elena," No, because chances are if he knows about vampires, then he also knows about Vervain"
31670,Damon, How about violence? Did you threaten him?
31671,Elena, No. I didn't threaten him
31672,Damon, At least tell you used torture
31673,Elena, Damon!
31674,Damon," You do realize that you are dating a reformed serial k*ll, right?"
31675,Elena, What would a hero do?
31676,Damon, Pfft. That I have no idea
31677,Elena, Stefan?
31678,Damon, I don't know. Probably mope at him
31679,Elena, Stefan's here right now
31680,Damon, What?
31681,Silas, Turn off your phone
31682,Damon," Elena? Whoa, whoa. That is not s…"
31683,Silas," I know you're upset that I didn't call, so I just wanted to apologize in person"
31684,Elena," Never do that again, ok? I thought something terrible happened to you"
31685,Silas," Well, something terrible did happen to me. You fell in love with my brother"
31686,Elena, Ouch
31687,Silas, Can't blame me for needing a little bit of space
31688,Elena, I know. Where did you go?
31689,Silas, It's not important. I'm sure Damon will fill you in eventually
31690,Elena," You talked to Damon? Because I just spoke to him, and he didn't really say anything"
31691,Silas," Oh. Weird. Maybe he has his hands full with the whole, you know, Jeremy situation"
31692,Elena, What Jeremy situation?
31693,Silas," Oh, it's not a big deal. Jeremy got expelled"
31694,Elena, Expelled?!
31695,Silas," Yeah, and then he and Damon got in this fight, and then Jeremy bolted"
31696,Elena, Wait. How do I not know about this? Where the hell is Jeremy?
31697,Silas, That's why I'm here. I was hoping maybe you'd know
31698,Katherine," Oh, thank God we're stopping. If I can only get out of the car"
31699,Matt," Well, you can't because as soon as we get gas, we're getting back on the road"
31700,Katherine, But I'm dying back here
31701,Jeremy, You're not getting out of the car because you want an aspirin
31702,Katherine," Then maybe I can get out of the car because I need to pee, like, in a bathroom like a lady"
31703,Jeremy, Hurry
31704,Katherine," My throat is really scratchy, and my head hurts, like, right here. When I cough, it's green. So get me stuff for all that"
31705,Jeremy, Silas knows I'm with you. Sorry. I can't risk being seen
31706,Katherine, Please
31707,Jeremy, Fine
31708,Matt, Just this
31709,Employee, Is that Elena Gilbert or Katherine Pierce?
31710,Matt," Jeremy, Katherine!"
31711,Jeremy, Stop running
31712,Caroline, Damon! Towel! Knock!
31713,Damon," Caroline, no one cares. No. Hey. Where's Elena?"
31714,Caroline, I don't know. She probably went to the bonfire to get more Intel on our weirdo professor
31715,Damon," Silas is here. He's with Elena, pretending to be Stefan. Get dressed"
31716,Caroline, I thought that Stefan dropped his body in the quarry
31717,Damon, Join the club. Get dressed
31718,Caroline," Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Elena was right. All summer, she's had this pit in her stomach about Stefan"
31719,Damon, What?
31720,Caroline, I don't know. She just said that she had this weird feeling that something was wrong with him
31721,Damon, Put some clothes on. Meet me out there. We have to find her
31722,Silas, Jeremy's still not answering. I'm gonna hold on to your phone in case he calls back
31723,Elena, Why are you so worried about him?
31724,Silas," Damon made a mess, and I want to clean it up"
31725,Elena, Did he really think that I wasn't gonna find out?
31726,Silas, It's Damon. Are you surprised?
31727,Elena," I just figured we were at a place where he wouldn't have to lie to me. Sorry. I, uh... I probably shouldn't be talking about this with you"
31728,Silas," It’s ok. I know exactly what you're thinking. Sorry. I don't mean to cut this short, but someone said they just saw Jeremy on Route 9. Do you know where he might be going?"
31729,Elena," Route 9? I mean, there was this old camp site that we used to go to when we were kids. Wait. Who texted you?"
31730,Silas," Hello, brother. But I suppose distant nephew is probably more accurate"
31731,Damon, Where the hell's Elena?
31732,Silas," Ohh. There's no need for violence, Damon. You'll find her eventually. There you go. Look. I get why you like her. I mean, I have a soft spot for brunettes, too.What I don't get is why she likes you"
31733,Damon, It's because you haven't had sex with me
31734,Silas, Cockiness masking fear. How transparent
31735,Damon, You expect me to believe you came all this way just to talk to her?
31736,Silas," No. That doesn't really make much sense, does it, but if I told you exactly what I did, then it would ruin the fun. Enjoy the bonfire, Damon"
31737,Caroline, Why would Silas want to hurt her?
31738,Damon, Because he wants to hurt me
31739,Caroline," You know, if you just would have told the truth, all of this could have been avoided"
31740,Damon," Gee. Thanks, Caroline. Your hindsight is invaluable in this situation"
31741,Student," Watch where you're going, douche"
31742,Damon, Have you see Elena Gilbert?
31743,Student," I have no idea who that is, and if I were her, I'd probably run from you, too"
31744,Damon, Wrong answer
31745,Caroline, Forget all this and get out of here
31746,Caroline, You have to calm down
31747,Damon, He turned the entire town square into a hunting party for Katherine. How am I supposed to calm down when every single person here could be working for Silas?
31748,Jessie, I got that
31749,Jesse, Whoa. I...
31750,Elena, Boyfriend drama
31751,Jessie," Wow. Boyfriend drama, kicked out of class… Today's not your day"
31752,Elena, What is his deal anyway?
31753,Jessie, Dr. Dickfield?
31754,Elena," Yeah, him"
31755,Jessie," Tell you what. Help me grab some more firewood, and I will tell you everything you need to know"
31756,Elena, Ok
31757,Jessie," I had Dr. Maxfield for a few classes last year. He's a jerk, but he's brilliant, so I'll give him a pass"
31758,Elena, Brilliant and creepy
31759,Jessie, There's a rumor that he's a part of this secret society on campus
31760,Elena, What like middle-aged men at an Elk lodge?
31761,Jessie," I have no idea. All I know is that a few times a week they supposedly meet at Whitmore house, but you didn't hear that from me"
31762,Elena, Damon? What the hell?
31763,Caroline, Seriously? That's Jesse! I kind of liked him
31764,Jeremy, Don't even think about it
31765,Katherine, Please. I wouldn't even know how to use it. I've never sh*t a g*n in my life. Didn't need to. I was much more deadly
31766,Matt," Key word… ""was”. I'm gonna go get some wood for the fire. I'll be back"
31767,Katherine," I survived childbirth, the death of my entire family, and 500 years of running from an immortal hybrid. You can understand why I'm a little upset that I am on the verge of being defeated by a sinus infection"
31768,Silas," Not a word out of you .You can't talk, you can't scream"
31769,Matt," Yeah. Actually, I can. Jeremy, run!"
31770,Silas," Why can't I get inside your head? Now I see why. Somebody's already in there. Why are you watching me, Traveler? Odpovezete mi!"
31771,Matt," Jeremy? Jeremy, hey. There you are, man. What… what the hell?"
31772,Bonnie," Freaky, isn't it, that feeling, the void, the emptiness?"
31773,Matt," Bonnie, what's going on? Where the hell am I?"
31774,Bonnie," The other side. Gilbert ring brought you here when you died. That's how it works. Temporarily brings your spirit here. To go back, you have to reconnect to your body"
31775,Matt, My body's not even here
31776,Bonnie," It's because each time you die you wake up farther and farther away from it, and you wander the other side until you find it"
31777,Matt," Wait. If I'm on the other side, how can you see me?"
31778,Bonnie, There's something you should know
31779,Damon, All right. Before you get mad…
31780,Elena, Mad can wait. Sit
31781,Damon," Elena...Wait. Wait. As much as I'd like to do this right now... Silas got into your head, didn't he? What did Stefan tell you to do?"
31782,Elena," Get you alone, weaken you... And then k*ll you. Damon, I'm so sorry. I... What the hell is happening?"
31783,Damon," You're in some sort of Silas trance, but I think you snapped out of it"
31784,Elena, Silas? But I…
31785,Damon," Before you ask, no. He's not in the quarry. It's a common misconception. You talked to him today"
31786,Elena, How is that possible? I… I was in a crowd full of people. I hugged him. I was talking to him about my life and about….
31787,Damon, Me? I bet he had some choice things to say
31788,Elena," Wait. If that was Silas, then where's Stefan? What happened to Stefan, Damon?Where is he?"
31789,Damon, Can we talk about this when you don't have that m*rder look in your eyes?
31790,Elena," You're right. Every time I look at you, all I want to do is k*ll you"
31791,Damon, It must be Silas' mind control. He's using your anger at me like a trigger. You have to resist it
31792,Elena, I can't!
31793,Damon," Elena, you have to resist it"
31794,Elena, I'm trying! Tell me what's going on
31795,Caroline, Sorry. This was all I could find out there. Sorry my friend went agro. He's got anger issues
31796,Jessie," And a serious right hook but, hey, it got us alone together, so that's a win"
31797,Caroline, I have a boyfriend
31798,Jessie, And where is he other than not here?
31799,Caroline," Well, he's supposed to be here. He deferred a semester. You don't have to say anything. I know how these things go. People go to school, and they drift apart"
31800,Jessie," Yeah, and sometimes, they don't"
31801,Caroline," Exactly. Sometimes, they don't"
31802,Jessie," And sometimes, you change, but what you had still means something"
31803,Caroline," Yes, yes!"
31804,Jessie," And sometimes when you're thinking all those things, your girlfriend is moving on and sleeping with somebody back home and has no intention of getting back with you"
31805,Caroline," Oh, my God. Ugh. I'm so sorry"
31806,Jessie," It was a while ago, and honestly until the worst actually happened, I wouldn't listen to anybody tell me otherwise. I could always find an excuse, so I get it"
31807,Jeremy, Get in the truck and drive
31808,Katherine, Where are you going?
31809,Jeremy, I can't leave Matt
31810,Katherine," Uh, wai… huh. How do you think I survived 500 years? It wasn't because I was a vampire. It's because I never looked back. Don't be dumb. Survive"
31811,Jeremy, That's why people treat you like an object and not like a person
31812,Bonnie," It actually hasn't been so bad. I have Jeremy, and I see grams sometimes. Last night with my dad was the first really hard time. I'll be ok. I just have to get past these next few days"
31813,Matt," Bonnie, you don't have to pretend like it's ok. Your dad died, and... You died. It's not ok"
31814,Bonnie, It has to be because there's nothing I can do about it
31815,Matt, I am so sorry
31816,Jeremy, Matt!
31817,Silas," I'd at least pretend to cry, which leads me to believe that he's not really dead. I take it that tacky ring somehow protects him"
31818,Jeremy, Too bad you can't get inside my head to find out for sure. Hunter's perk
31819,Silas," Heh. See, that's what you don't get. When I can read your mind, I at least have use for you. Now I'm just gonna k*ll you"
31820,Jeremy," You can try, but none of your abilities work on me, so right now, you're nothing… slower than a vampire, weaker than a vampire. I on the other hand am a hunter. Plus I work out"
31821,Silas," You might be stronger than me, that I am immortal"
31822,Jeremy, I thought you said you didn't know how to use that
31823,Katherine, I figured it out
31824,Elena, Poor Bonnie. She must have tried to call me right after Silas stole my phone. Has anyone talked to her? Is she ok?
31825,Damon, I don't know. I've had more important things to worry about
31826,Elena, My best friend's dad died. That's pretty damn important
31827,Damon," Yeah? Well, so is protecting your brother, finding mine, and figuring out what the hell Silas wants"
31828,Elena, I just left. What the hell is wrong with you?
31829,Damon," You're getting angry at me again, Elena. Remember, trigger"
31830,Elena," My brother got expelled! You've got him playing white knight to Katherine, who's tried to k*ll me... Repeatedly. Stefan's been…he's been suffering for months while I've been rolling around with you, a self-proclaimed serial k*ll. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
31831,Damon," Elena, that is the gas. Stop. You don't really want to k*ll me, Elena. You have to realize this before you're gonna break Silas' compulsion"
31832,Elena," I can't, ok? All I can think about is k*ll you!"
31833,Damon," Well, you're gonna have to think about something stronger than your desire to k*ll me, or you're gonna k*ll us both. Stefan, Stefan. Think about Stefan. Caroline told me you'd been worried about him, that you had a pit in your stomach. Describe it, tell me about it"
31834,Elena, What? No. I can't
31835,Damon, Think about him. Think about the feelings you're getting. Describe it to me
31836,Elena," It's a... It's a chill. I can't explain it, but it's like I can feel him. He's trying to reach out to me, but I don't know where he is, and I can't understand what he's trying to say. All I know is that he's scared, and he's lonely, and he's in a lot of pain. He's in a lot of pain. We have to find him"
31837,Damon, We will. I swear
31838,Elena," The rage, it’s gone"
31839,Caroline, I think we need to set some ground rules for when boyfriends come to visit
31840,Matt," I think somebody moved my body. It's weird, but I can feel it. It's like I'm drawn to it"
31841,Bonnie, There it is
31842,Matt," So if this happens every time I die with the Gilbert ring, the second I go back, that means I'm just gonna forget about all of this. I'll forget that you're dead. Bonnie, you and Jeremy can't keep this a secret anymore. I'm sorry your dad died. I know it's hard, but how are you gonna deal with his death if you can't even deal with your own?"
31843,Bonnie," It's really good to see you, Matt"
31844,Katherine, Welcome back to the land of the living
31845,Matt, What the hell happened?
31846,Jeremy," Yeah. Silas k*ll you, tried to k*ll me, then…"
31847,Katherine, I sh*t him. So we're even. No more whining. Let's go. Silas won't be down for long
31848,Jeremy, Hey. I left the hatchet. I'll be right back
31849,Jeremy, Hey. You ok?
31850,Bonnie," I'm not ready to be dead yet, Jeremy. I'm just not. Maybe I will be one day, but it's not today, and I don't know what to do about my dad or what to do when the sheriff calls because she's gonna call me…"
31851,Jeremy," it's ok. We'll get through this. I can tell everybody that you're with family, that it was too hard for you to be here. I might not be able to touch you or hold you, but I'm here for you no matter what you need"
31852,Man, Did you find that girl that you were looking for?
31853,Silas," Yes, I did, and then she sh*t me, so I'm a little bit angry, and I'm a little bit hungry, but luckily, you can help me out with one of those things. Fill her up"
31854,Silas," Oh, goody. Gypsies are here. Oh, I'm sorry. You call yourselves travelers now, right?"
31855,Traveler, It's much more P.C. You can call me whatever you want when I'm gutting you
31856,Silas," I see. You're mad that I k*ll your blond-haired, blue-eyed host, right? That's what you get for taking over somebody's body to spy on me, but congrats. You found me, so now what?What do you want?"
31857,Traveler," You back in that tomb, sealed away for eternity"
31858,Nadia," That's what the travelers have always wanted. Luckily for you, I've never really considered myself one. I know you can see inside my mind, and I have my own agenda"
31859,Silas, Yes. I see that you do
31860,Elena," I'll be back, roomie. I don't know when, but I will be back"
31861,Caroline," Just call me the minute you hear from Bonnie, ok? I've left her, like, a hundred messages."
31862,Elena, I will. I promise
31863,Caroline," You're gonna find him, Elena"
31864,Elena," Yeah, I know"
31865,Elena, Bye
31866,1.," I didn't think Elena Gilbert would give up so easily. Sorry about being a hard ass earlier. It's kind of my thing. You're Grayson Gilbert's daughter, aren't you?"
31867,Elena, You knew my dad?
31868,1., Knew of him. He's a legend around here. Brilliant. I've studied all his research. I can only hope to do the kind of work he did
31869,Elena," So does that mean that he forged death certificates, too?"
31870,1., And here I thought you were just passionate about microbiology. I have office hours tomorrow. Come by. We can chat
31871,Elena," Um, yeah, I would, but I've got other important things on my plate right now"
31872,1., Let me know when that plate clears
31873,Damon," Well, I guess that's how a hero would do it. Honesty. Who'd have thunk it? Aren't you the least bit curious about the whole ""Nancy Drew and the creepster Professor"" thing?"
31874,Elena, Caroline will take over. I can't stay here knowing that Stefan's out there somewhere
31875,Damon, Yeah. Well...
31876,Elena, That's Stefan's daylight ring
31877,Damon," Snagged it from Silas yesterday, and for the record, I am secure enough in our relationship that you having psychic dreams about your ex-boyfriend does not bother me... But it still sucks"
31878,Elena," I love you. We're gonna save Stefan, and I'm still gonna love you, ok?"
31879,Damon, Yeah?
31880,Liz, We found something
31881,Liz," We didn't find anything in the quarry, but a deputy found this a few miles away. We didn't open it. Looks like it's been in there for 3 months. Chances are he's hungry"
31882,Elena," Oh, my God. That's not Stefan"
31883,Damon, You're right. He was hungry. Bet he still is
31884,Woman," Hey, man. Last call was 4 hours ago. If you want some coffee, I could put some on"
31885,Stefan, Run. Run!
31886,Damon, Unnn. You must have restless sleep syndrome or something. It's like sleeping with a tornado. Hey. We were up all night. You're exhausted. Come back to sleep
31887,Elena, I had a dream about Stefan
31888,Damon, Oh
31889,Elena," It was more than just a pit in my stomach this time, though. It was real. It was like I was there with him"
31890,Damon," I know I said it didn't bother me that you have some psychic connection to your ex-boyfriend, but I don't need a play-by-play, Elena"
31891,Elena, You're right. It's weird. Sorry
31892,Damon, Fine. Tell me. I'm sure whatever's in my imagination is 10 times worse than what's going on in your subconscious
31893,Elena," It was just so vivid. It had a red awning and this broken neon sign, and he was screaming in pain"
31894,Damon," Well, should I go check in the attic, see if there's a crystal ball? Maybe you can conjure up an address"
31895,Katherine, Route 29. Joe's Bar. I think I had the exact same dream
31896,Damon," So I've found 9 bars along Route 29, and none of them are called Joe's"
31897,Elena," I had a feeling there was something wrong all summer, and I ignored it, but I was right. Stefan was in a safe. Probably k*ll whoever it was that found him. I know it sounds crazy that I'm following some psychic dream, but it's the only lead that we have"
31898,Damon," It doesn't sound crazy. It is crazy, but I'm open-minded"
31899,Katherine, g*n! What? I get carsick in the back seat. Another charming human side effect you stuck me with
31900,Elena, Please tell me that she's not coming
31901,Damon," Trust me, I have no interest in Katherine's well-being, but for some reason, Silas wants her real bad, and if Silas wants her, I want her more"
31902,Elena," Can't we just stash her in the cellar or maybe a deep, dark well with a pair of water wings?"
31903,Katherine," Do you really think that I want to take a road trip with you, America's most boring, self-righteous vampire? Just remember, Damon wouldn't have to play bodyguard if you hadn't shoved that cure down my throat"
31904,Elena, You were trying to k*ll me
31905,Katherine," I will admit, though, I take great pleasure knowing that you wasted your one sh*t at a human life on me"
31906,Damon," All right. Play nice, or I'm gonna revisit the deep, dark well idea"
31907,Katherine," I want to find Stefan just as much as you do and not just because I don't want to be a pawn that you can trade off for his life. I care about him. I always have, and since we've been having the same dream, makes me think that you care about him just as much"
31908,Damon, Ok. Train's leaving the station. Choo-choo
31909,Silas," You ever play the ""what if"" game? When you're calcified for 2,000 years, you learn to entertain yourself with these little brain teasers"
31910,Nadia," Look, Silas. This phone is prepaid, and I don't have a lot of minutes"
31911,Silas," Oh, no, no, no. It's really easy. I'll go first. You know how much I hate travelers, so to prove your allegiance to me, you k*ll your traveler friend Gregor, but what if it as all an act? What if he's still alive?"
31912,Nadia, You saw him bleed out. You buried his body yourself.
31913,Silas, But what if Matt's tacky ring brought him back to life?
31914,Nadia," If this is the game, it's boring"
31915,Silas," If we're gonna work together, I need to know that you're on my side, so find out if Matt Donovan's still alive and k*ll him"
31916,Nadia," what if he could help us to find Katherine Pierce? She's still your priority, is she not?"
31917,Silas," yes, she is. So get the information that you need, rip that ring off Matt's little finger, and make sure he doesn't cheat death again"
31918,Silas, I'll take care of it
31919,Stefan," I don't want to hurt you, so get away from me, before I rip your throat out"
31920,Tessa," Hello to you, too. I brought dinner. A vampire doppelganger who's burdened by a conscience. Now I've seen everything"
31921,Stefan," You saved me from burning to death outside that bar this morning, didn't you?"
31922,Tessa," And I pulled you from the quarry before that. That is, I figured out where you were and told the former owner of this cabin to pull your lock box from the water. You thanked him by biting off his head"
31923,Stefan, How do you know I'm a doppelganger?
31924,Tessa, Because I've seen your face before on someone who wasn't you
31925,Stefan, Who are you?
31926,Tessa, How much do you know about Silas?
31927,Stefan," I know that he's a bloodthirsty immortal who's k*ll more people than I can count, and that was before he stole my identity, locked me up in a safe, and dropped me in the bottom of a quarry"
31928,Tessa, You made it through
31929,Stefan," Barely. I came very close to flipping off my humanity switch, but I didn't because I knew if I ever got out I wanted to be myself when I k*ll him"
31930,Tessa, Strong words
31931,Stefan," He's a monster, and I'm going after him"
31932,Tessa," Except you'll burn to death in the sun without your daylight ring.Silas wasn't always a monster. He used to be a simple man in love with a simple girl, his soul mate. She was his one true love. You know how that goes. They thought their love would last forever"
31933,Stefan, How do you know all this?
31934,Tessa, Because I was there in his arms
31935,Stefan, You're telling me that you were Silas's one true love
31936,Tessa, I would have done anything for him
31937,Stefan, That's impossible. How are you here right now?
31938,Tessa," Love bends the rules of possible. Silas and I were the two most powerful members of a gifted people called Travelers. When we were engaged to be married, we decided to reach even further"
31939,Silas," I don't ever want to be parted from you, even by death"
31940,Tessa, We wanted to find a way for our love to last forever
31941,Stefan," Yeah, look. I know the story. Everything was great for Silas until some witch named Qetsiyah or whatever came by and screwed him over, right?"
31942,Tessa," Wrong. You don't know the story. Silas convinced Qetsiyah that he loved her so she would make the immortality spell, but when she found out that he was just using her, she dumped in a tomb with a cure, hoping he would take it and die because she had created a supernatural limbo to trap his soul"
31943,Stefan," Like any other sane, rational, well-adjusted woman would do"
31944,Tessa," Which catches us up to today. Now Silas wants to destroy that supernatural limbo. Once the other side is gone, he can take the cure,become mortal, and die, and finally pass on and find peace"
31945,Stefan," Look. If you really are Silas' one true love and you're not dead, then why don't you just do us all a favor and run off into the sunset together?"
31946,Tessa," Silas was my true love. I never said that I was his. I'm Qetsiyah, that sane, rational, well-adjusted woman you seem to know so much about. Clearly you've heard the man's version of the story, the one where I'm a back-stabbing lunatic who ruined everything for Silas, a raging bitch witch whose obsession with vengeance created a whole new dimension of suffering in the afterlife"
31947,Stefan, What are you doing here? I thought you were dead and on the other side
31948,Tessa," I was for 2,000 years, but I came back... For you"
31949,Damon, You sure you know what you're looking for? Last bar had a red awning and a neon sign
31950,Elena, I'll know when I see it
31951,Katherine," Me, too"
31952,Damon, Didn't ask you
31953,Katherine," I'm just trying to make conversation. Anything to drown out the sound of eggshells breaking. So, Elena, I couldn't help but overhear. You've been dreaming about Stefan all summer? That must be really stressful on a new relationship, especially when you're having those kinds of dreams lying in bed next to his brother"
31954,Elena," They weren't dreams. It was just a bad feeling, like something wasn't right with him"
31955,Katherine," Oh, no. Yeah, sure. I totally get it. There's still a connection between you two. Maybe deep down you know that he was your one true love and breaking up with him was a big mistake"
31956,Damon," Ignore her. As soon as the vervain's out of her system, we'll compel her, and we'll put her on mute"
31957,Katherine, Or maybe Stefan's been trying to reach out to you all summer but you've been too distracted with Damon to help him so he reached out to the person that he trusts… me. Nah. You're probably right. Elena and I had the exact same dream on the exact same night. Why would that mean something?
31958,Matt," What the hell did you do to me? Look. I know you and your creep show boyfriend screwed with my head the other night, so who the hell are you, and what do you want?"
31959,Nadia, I'm here to keep you safe from Silas
31960,Matt, Silas? What do you know about Silas?
31961,Nadia," I know that he still wants you dead. You're going to need to trust me, Ok?"
31962,Nadia," Gregor, I'm sorry, but Silas was going to k*ll you. Doing it myself was the only way to salvage the deal. I need his trust"
31963,Matt/Gregor, So you slit my throat?
31964,Nadia, You knew the stakes. It is why we put you inside the person with the invincibility ring
31965,Matt/Gregor, So now what? I am just a passenger that you can call out of Matt's head and put away whenever you want?
31966,Nadia," I will find a way to make this permanent, Gregor, because I love you, Ok? And I will do anything, anything for you"
31967,Matt/Gregor, Tell me where you buried my body
31968,Nadia," Ok, but first, you will have to dial your friend Elena Gilbert and find out where Katherine is"
31969,Stefan," Do you have, a, uh, cell phone? I have to make a phone call"
31970,Tessa," There's no cell reception out here, and remember, I made it safe for you here, but I wouldn't go outside if I were you"
31971,Stefan," No offense, Qetsiyah. I'm having a bit of a hard time believing what you're saying"
31972,Tessa," ""Qetsiyah."" Sounds so... Ancient timey, don't you think? How about Tessa? It's a little different but not so different you wouldn't find it on one of those souvenir key chains"
31973,Stefan," So that's why you rejoined the land of the living, souvenir key chains?"
31974,Tessa," I'm here because the Bennett witch lowered the veil. I saw an opportunity to make myself a living, breathing mortal, and I thought, ""why not?"" My hunters had failed in their task to k*ll Silas. I figured it was time to handle things in person"
31975,Stefan," Well, 2,000 years is a hell of a long time to hold a grudge"
31976,Tessa, You have clearly never been left at the altar
31977,Tessa," Like a lovesick idiot, I created an entire garden for our wedding, and I made a spell that would keep us alive forever, an immortality spell so we would never have to part. Silas and I were going to drink the immortality elixir as part of our wedding ceremony, but then everything around me started to die, my wedding flower, the garden trellis, our harvest, and then I realized why. Silas has already used the immortality spell. He was already drinking the elixir somewhere else. He took what he wanted, and then the bastard abandoned me."
31978,Tessa," So call me a woman scorned or a vindictive bitch or whatever label suits your story, but I thought I was his one true love, and he ripped my heart out"
31979,Stefan, I’m sorry
31980,Tessa," I deserved a chance to look him in the eye and make him understand how much he hurt me, so I found him in the wilderness with the woman he gave my immortality to, the woman he chose over me,and just when I thought his betrayal couldn't cut any deeper, I learned that his actual true love was someone very close to me... My handmaiden"
31981,Silas," Just as you are mine, I am yours forever because when I look at you... Amara... All I see is an angel"
31982,Stefan," So Silas was the first version of me, and your friend was the first version of Elena?"
31983,Tessa," Amara was hardly a friend. When they drank the immortality elixir, they violated the natural law that all living things must die, so nature found a balance by creating mortal shadow selves"
31984,Stefan, Doppelgangers
31985,Tessa, Like you and Katherine and Elena all caused by the ripple effect from Silas and Amara's sin
31986,Stefan, You want to tell me what the hell you've been doing this whole time?
31987,Tessa," Silas stole your daylight ring. You're going to need a new one. When this is ready, I need your help to take down Silas once and for all"
31988,Elena, Are we really just gonna leave her in the car?
31989,Damon, The only time she shuts up is when she's sleeping. I didn't want to disturb our peace and quiet. I thought you said this was the one
31990,Elena, It is. It looks exactly like it did in the dream. Isn't that a little freaky?
31991,Damon, Yeah. It's a lot of freaky. Let's go see if Stef's inside
31992,Bartender, Can I get you something?
31993,Damon," Yeah, sure. Why don't you tell me what happened to your neck, Jo?"
31994,Jo," Some psycho attacked me, bit me, told me to run, so I did, and when I looked back, he was on fire"
31995,Elena, The sun must have come up. He doesn't have his daylight ring
31996,Damon, And then what happened?
31997,Jo," Some woman shoved him into a truck, drove away"
31998,Damon, Did you know this woman?
31999,Jo, No. She was driving Cam Peterson's truck. He lives about 10 miles down that dirt road out back. Here. Look like you could use one of these
32000,Damon, Hmm. I could. Thank you
32001,Damon, Vervain
32002,Elena, What did you do?
32003,Nadia, I told her to pour him a drink or I'd k*ll her
32004,Damon, Who the hell are you?
32005,Nadia, Which one of you is Katherine Pierce?
32006,Katherine, She is
32007,Nadia," Katherine is a compulsive liar, but I need her alive"
32008,Elena," Katherine, run!"
32009,Nadia, You really do look exactly alike
32010,Damon, Wonderful. Now we've got a vampire bounty hunter to deal with. Let me guess. Eurobitch was not part of the dream
32011,Elena, I've never seen her before
32012,Damon," Yeah. Well, whoever she was, she wants Katherine, which means she's probably a Silas spy"
32013,Elena, I'll go chase after her. You find Stefan
32014,Damon, Wait. What? No. She almost k*ll you
32015,Elena," We don't have time for a detour. Damon, Stefan's hurt. Find him"
32016,Damon," Wait. No. Stop. Just wait. Any sign of trouble, you let her go, do you understand me? I don't care how bad Silas wants Katherine. She's not worth the hair on your head. You got me? Ok? Kiss me. Go"
32017,Tessa, Hovering actually slows down the process
32018,Stefan," Ah. Got it. So what's your, uh, plan? Take the cure and shove it down Silas' throat, k*ll him?"
32019,Tessa, You're skipping ahead. We don't stand a chance against Silas with his mental powers
32020,Stefan," You took him down before, right?"
32021,Tessa," A long time ago. That was before he could compel masses, and 2,000 years of consuming dribbles of bl*od from thousands of people, it's allowed him to hone his k*ll. It prepared him to escape from the tomb I put him in"
32022,Stefan," Is that where Amara is right now, locked away in a tomb?"
32023,Tessa," No, Stefan. Amara is not locked in a tomb"
32024,Silas, What are you doing here?
32025,Tessa, I brought you two gifts. The first is the chalice from which we were to drink at our wedding
32026,Silas, I know you must be very angry with me
32027,Tessa," I was… For a time, but then I realized it was within my power to forgive you by creating this, your second gift, a cure for immortality"
32028,Silas, That's not possible
32029,Tessa," I promise you, it works. I just used it on someone else immortal"
32030,Silas, What did you do? Amara!
32031,Silas, Amara! No. Amara! No! No!
32032,Tessa, She couldn't speak after I cut her throat... But I could tell by the way her heart was b*at... She knew she was going to die
32033,Silas," I will k*ll you, I will k*ll you!"
32034,Tessa," You will not come near me unless you take the cure and give up your immortality. Take the cure, Silas. We can live long human lives together"
32035,Tessa, Can't say I didn't give him a second chance
32036,Stefan, That's what you call a second chance?
32037,Tessa," I'm a complicated person, but Silas remains a simple man. I created the other side as a supernatural barrier between Silas and the peaceful afterlife he craved. Then I dropped him in that tomb with that cure, thinking eventually he would take it and k*ll himself to be with Amara just so he could realize that he was caught with me for all eternity"
32038,Stefan, How's that working out for you?
32039,Tessa, He's been a little stubborn
32040,Stefan," I take it you're not really making me a daylight ring, are you?"
32041,Tessa, Do you really think I'd give you the one thing you need to walk out of here?
32042,Stefan, All right. Listen. We're on the same side. I want Silas gone as much as you do
32043,Tessa, Have you not been listening to me. I have trust issues. I'm controlling and paranoid and a little crazy. And that's working out just fine
32044,Katherine," I'm can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm really glad it's you. My leg is cramping, and I'm freezing. Do you mind if I, uh… can I borrow your sweater?"
32045,Elena, Let's go before she doubles back
32046,Katherine, Why didn't you k*ll me?
32047,Elena," If Silas wants you, that means you're leverage"
32048,Katherine," No. I mean, after you shoved the cure down my throat. I was trying to k*ll you. Why didn't you finish me off?"
32049,Elena," You think that because we share the same dreams and both care about Stefan that we're alike, but we're not. I value my humanity, which is why I let you live, to give you a chance to find whatever shred of humanity's buried underneath 500 years of bad behavior"
32050,Katherine, Or maybe you thought that being human was punishment worse than death for me
32051,Elena, Naw. That was just a happy accident
32052,Katherine," Well...thank you. I'm glad to know that you care, even if you are a condescending bitch"
32053,Nadia," Do I have to knock you out, too?"
32054,Katherine, Not necessary
32055,Damon, Stefan. You couldn't call a brother?
32056,Stefan," Nice to see you, too, Damon"
32057,Damon, What the hell is going on here?
32058,Stefan," Well, Silas' ex-girlfriend decided to come back from the other side"
32059,Damon, Qetsi-whatever?
32060,Tessa, It's Qetsiyah. Do you see why I want to change it? You won't be able to break those vines. The spell won't release him until I get what I want
32061,Damon, I guess the rumors are true. You are a ray of sunshine. Question--why is my brother wearing your compost pile?
32062,Tessa," I'm going to link Stefan to Silas. Casting a spell on his doppelganger will neutralize Silas' mental powers. Once he's weakened, I will force him to take the cure"
32063,Damon," That's a great idea; force the cure down his throat. The cure's gone, done, it's ingested"
32064,Tessa, Katherine you mean. I'm aware of her condition. She was supposed to be with you
32065,Stefan, Wait. Katherine took the cure?
32066,Damon," We have a lot to catch up on, Stefan. Wait a minute. What do you mean supposed to be with me?Did you plant those dreams? What is it, some kind of, like, witch party trick?"
32067,Tessa, So where is she?
32068,Damon, We ran into a little snag
32069,Tessa, Then I'll get started without her
32070,Damon," Ok. Well, thanks for the hospitality, but we should really get going if we want to b*at traffic"
32071,Stefan," Yep, yep. He's right"
32072,Tessa, Probably don't want to get on my bad side
32073,Damon," You realize you're not the only one with a bad side, right?"
32074,Tessa," Aren't you brave? Without Silas' mental powers, he is an immortal nobody. We can defeat him. Isn't that what you want?"
32075,Stefan," Just do it, all right? Just get it over with. Do it"
32076,Katherine," Sorry to sound like a broken record, but I like to know the identity of my kidnappers. Who are you, and what do you want?"
32077,Nadia," Ask me again, and I'll sew your mouth shut"
32078,Katherine, Silas. Of course it's you
32079,Nadia, What are you doing here?
32080,Silas," GPS tracker. It's even better than a locator spell. Thank you for working so quickly, Nadia"
32081,Nadia, I'm not ready to hand her over yet
32082,Silas," Oh, that's right. Your fascinating unfinished business I don't care about"
32083,Nadia, Get out of my head
32084,Katherine, What are you two talking about?
32085,Silas, Let go of her arm. Now I want you to pull out your g*n... And aim it at your heart. Good. Now pull... The trig…ugh!
32086,Katherine," Seriously, what is going on?"
32087,Damon, What are you doing to my brother?
32088,Tessa, Frying Silas' brain. No one said it would be pretty
32089,Damon, All right. We're done here
32090,Tessa, You're right. We're done. It worked
32091,Damon," Stefan, Stefan! Stef? Damn it. Whatever you did to him, undo it"
32092,Tessa, Relax. I just b*rned through his conscious mind. He'll wake eventually. You sure you want to take him home?You and Elena were doing so well without your guilt getting in the way
32093,Damon, Spying on us from the other side?
32094,Tessa," Don't flatter yourself. It was like watching a soap opera except boring and with no volume control. You know, there was one thing worse than being on the other side and watching Silas resist the cure"
32095,Damon," Oh, yeah? What was that, realizing that your plan totally sucked?"
32096,Tessa," Century after century, I watched versions of Stefan and Elena find each other like magnets, always the same story… conquering all, falling in love. You didn't think your brother was Silas' first shadow? Destiny has been trying to get the doppelgangers together forever"
32097,Damon," Look here, miss crazy, why don't we just dial down the destiny talk a notch, Ok?"
32098,Tessa," You don't want to hear it, but the universe is working against you"
32099,Damon," If you're trying to downplay your reputation as being a psychopath, you might not want to say you're spokesperson for the universe"
32100,Tessa," You and I are the same, Damon, the obstacle standing between two fates. Silas had his true love, and Stefan has Elena. We're merely the conflict that makes it interesting"
32101,Damon," So what are you suggesting, I leave him here with you while I run off and live happily ever after with Elena?"
32102,Tessa, I'd keep him safe
32103,Damon, You have a bad track record with men
32104,Tessa," I want to keep him safe. Now that he's linked to Silas, Silas can't mess with our heads, and as long as Stefan's in the way, you will never be with Elena. Take it from a woman who's had front row seats for 2,000 years"
32105,Damon, No one would have to know?
32106,Tessa, No one has to know
32107,Damon, Or you could just go back to hell
32108,Elena," Stefan! Stefan! Hey! Oh, no. Stefan, hey. Stefan, can you hear me? Stefan! Wake up. Oh god"
32109,Katherine," Fine. I was snooping, trying to find a passport or a business card or maybe even a parking ticket because you won't tell me who you are"
32110,Nadia, You said you were hungry
32111,Katherine," For food, not packaged poison"
32112,Nadia, Suit yourself
32113,Nadia, Silas the betrayer. Someone lived up to his reputation today
32114,Silas, Where are you?
32115,Nadia, Wouldn't you like to know?
32116,Silas," You know, I may not be able to read your mind anymore…"
32117,Nadia, it's too bad you lost the one thing that made you interesting
32118,Silas," But that won't stop me from k*ll you if you don't hold up your end of the deal. Now whatever twisted fantasy you're playing out with Katherine is your issue, but she stays alive"
32119,Nadia, We'll see
32120,Silas," It wasn't a question. As you mentioned earlier, Katherine is still my priority, and since I lost my psychic abilities, that can only mean one thing. My ex-fiancée is alive again, and she's on her way to Mystic Falls"
32121,Nadia," Well, maybe you two will get back together"
32122,Silas," Heh heh. Reconciliation isn't really her thing. She hates me as much as I hate her, and if you think that I don't play fair, wait till you see what she's capable of because Qetsiyah and I have some common ground… neither one of us will stop until we get what we want, and both of us want the cure"
32123,Katherine," Enough of the games, Silas. What do you want with me?"
32124,Silas," You know, it's funny. The love of my life looked exactly like you, and yet the mere thought of your face makes me want to vomit"
32125,Katherine," I don't know what you're talking about, but if I'm nothing but a gag reflex to you, why not cut me loose, and then we could call it day?"
32126,Silas," Because the cure still exists, and I still want it. It's just running through your veins right now. Your bl*od is the cure, Katherine. Does that clear things up for you?"
32127,Matt, Hello?
32128,Elena," It's me. I just wanted to let you know that we found Stefan. Unfortunately, we lost Katherine along the way. Hey. Are you Ok? You sounded weird on the phone earlier. I was worried"
32129,Matt, Wait. We talked on the phone today? When?
32130,Elena,You called and asked me if we found Stefan and if Katherine was safe. I told you where we were headed. You don't remember?
32131,Matt," Yeah, yeah. I remember. Can I call you back tomorrow?"
32132,Elena, Ok
32133,Damon," Well, he's got his daylight ring back. We're all set for a picnic"
32134,Elena," He's lucky he has a brother who looks out for him. Otherwise, you might have pawned it for a pinball machine. You're suspiciously quiet. Tell me what Qetsiyah said back at the cabin"
32135,Damon, She told me that we don't stand a chance
32136,Elena, And what does she know about us?
32137,Damon," Well, she told me a very interesting little story about the history of doppelgangers, how they're fated to fall in love with each other. Basically, the universe programmed you to fall in love with Stefan, not me, which means... We're a lost cause no matter what we do. I'm paraphrasing"
32138,Elena, The universe?
32139,Damon," Her words, not mine"
32140,Elena, So she's crazy?
32141,Damon, Maybe. Maybe she's not
32142,Elena," Look. I know I spent the last couple days focusing on trying to find Stefan, but that has nothing to do with how I feel about you, and I'm not gonna let Silas' 2,000-year-old ex-girlfriend screw things up between us"
32143,Damon," You think I am? I mean, no one tells me how I live my life, no one tells me who I love, especially not some vindictive prehistoric witch and definitely not the universe, and I'm not gonna let someone else's idea of destiny stop me from loving you or being with you or building a future with you because you are my life"
32144,Damon," Welcome back, brother"
32145,Elena, Stefan... We missed you
32146,Stefan," Uh, I'm sorry. I… I have no idea who you people are."
32147,Stefan," (reading) ""March 12, 1922. I blacked out for days. I woke up in a stranger's bl*od in places I don't recognize with women I don't remember.""Damon: ""I feel alive again.""Stefan: (scoffs) All right. I think I've read enough.Damon: Nada?Stefan: I know ""nada"" means nothing. I know what day it is, I know what year it is, I know this car has a V-8 engine, and yet I am two journals deep, and I have absolutely no memory of who the hell I am.Damon: Well..."
32148,Stefan," And, is this supposed to fill me up?Damon: Well, yes, and no. Technically, yeah, because you're a vampire.Stefan: Weird.Damon: Realistically no, because you're, you know, you.Stefan: Ahh, yes. The insatiable and blood-lusting vampire, Ripper of Monterrey.Damon: And we're only in the 1920s, baby."
32149,Stefan," Well, sorry, but this is a lot to process."
32150,Damon," You're a vampire, not a cave man."
32151,Stefan," So, let me get this straight. I helped you steal this car, I found out I was a vampire who k*ll his own father, and yet I don't litter?Damon: You're a man of principle, Stefan, who had his memories erased by a 2,000-year-old witch.Stefan: Yeah. Well, I bet that 2,000-year-old witch probably drives a little faster than you. Wait. Let me guess. (patting himself) Fun brother, (patting Damon) safe brother."
32152,Stefan, What are you doing?Damon: Do you trust me?Stefan: Do I really have a choice?Damon: Nope.
32153,Stefan," (chuckling) Oh. Oh, ho. Ohh. I got it. You're the fun brother.Damon: (chuckles) Whew."
32154,Elena," Please tell me I wasn't out of my mind leaving Damon in charge of Vampire Amnesia 101.Caroline: What did he say exactly?Elena: One text – ""So far, so good."" Which, in Damon speak...Caroline: Means that they probably devoured a troop of Girls Scouts by now.Elena: Caroline!Caroline: I'm kidding... kind of. Although it's not uncommon for patients with retrograde amnesia or other traumatic brain injuries to turn volatile.Elena: Okay, Dr. Forbes. Since when do you know so much about amnesia?Caroline: It's possible I studied up on my chem, biochem, applied microbio, molecular bio, and Grey's Anatomy—the real one and the television show.Elena: You did all that for Stefan?Caroline: Of course I did. I'm also trying to impress Dr. Maxfield. I figured if I could get closer to him, i.e. into his biology class, maybe I could figure out why he covered up our roommate's m*rder by vampire, and it's also possible that I have a study buddy."
32155,Caroline," Hi, Dr. Maxfield. Are you ready to go study, Jesse?Elena: Jesse? Dr. Maxfield's incredibly hot, funny, and miraculously single lab assistant?Caroline: I'm dragging him to our hometown graveyard bell-ringing ceremony.Elena: As in creepy first date?Caroline: As in a study date. While I'm there, I might as well ring a bell for Tyler and me considering our relationship is on its death bed.Jesse: See you Monday, Doc.Dr. Maxfield: Stay out of trouble.Caroline: (to Elena) Will I see you there? You could bring Stefan. I mean, it is ironically called ""Remembrance Day"".Elena: I hope so, I really do. It just depends on how Stefan's handling the whole download of his dark and stormy past.Caroline: (to Jesse, whispers) Hi. (to Elena) All right. Well, I'll talk to you later."
32156,Guy, To Uncle Steve!All: To Uncle Steve!
32157,Damon," Yeah!Stefan: Wow. Ahh. This town always so b*at about dead people?Damon: Well, in the theme of morbid town tradition, you go back to the 1820s when everyone was so paranoid about the cholera thing that they would occasionally bury a body a wee bit before its time.Stefan: So, we have a holiday dedicated to burying people alive?Damon: Well, they were so paranoid that they would actually request to be buried with a string attached to a bell above ground, and then the whole family would hang around the grave for 24 hours in hopes of hearing the bell and that their loved one would come back, but now it's just really—it's really a kick-ass excuse to get hammered."
32158,Damon, Hello.Waitress: Hi.
32159,Damon," Uh, hey, darling. We'd love another round, please.Waitress: You got it."
32160,Stefan," What the hell was that?Damon: That, my brother, was you jonesing for something a little stronger than a bl*od bag.Stefan: So, what's the problem? You spent the whole day trying to convince me I was a vampire. I'm convinced. Let me act like one.Damon: Well, unfortunately, Stefan, there are two types of vampires in the world, okay? There are those that can handle moderation, and then there's you.Stefan: Well, I'm no shrink. Right?Damon: Right.Stefan: But maybe k*ll our father and turning into a vampire and all the trauma associated with that is what made me become a vampire who feeds on people and then rips their heads off, but now that I don't have all those memories and all that guilt, maybe the Ripper thing won't be such a problem.Damon: Let's not try it out, okay?"
32161,Elena, And there I thought catching up on nearly two centuries would be a drag.Stefan: Remind me of your name again.
32162,Elena, Elena.Stefan: Elena. Right.Elena: (To Damon) You haven't told him about me?Damon: 200 years is a long time.
32163,Elena, Right. Well...
32164,Bonnie, Don't stop on my account.
32165,Jeremy," Sorry. I, uh... I just went for a run. What are you doing here?Bonnie: It's not like there's Netflix where I am. You working out is my main source of entertainment.Jeremy: I was just working off the extra adrenaline.Bonnie: And every girl on the Other Side thanks you for it."
32166,Jeremy," So, is this our new thing? You make dead jokes while I avoid all of our friends on your behalf?Bonnie: There's nothing I can do to get Stefan's memory back, Jeremy.Jeremy: But they don't know that because they don't know you're dead. They're waiting for you to help them because that's what you do. You help.Bonnie: What happened to you being there for me in my decisions?Jeremy: I want to, Bon, but not like this."
32167,Jeremy," Hey.Matt: Hey, Jer. You got a sec? Um, I'm kind of freaking out here.Jeremy: Yeah. Yeah. What's going on?"
32168,Matt," So, I woke up last night covered in mud with this."
32169,Jeremy," Okay. Weird.Matt: Yeah, I know. I have no idea where it came from. I blacked out, and I'm pretty sure that it's not the first time.Jeremy: How many times have you died wearing the Gilbert ring?Matt: No. I don't think it's the Gilbert ring that's messing with me. No. Like, it's got to have something to do with why Silas couldn't mind-control me. He saw something or someone or whatever that Czech freak put in my head, but I think it's still there."
32170,Jeremy," What's with the camera?Matt: I set them up all over the house to help me figure out how I'm losing time. Have you talked to Bonnie? I think that she's the only person that might know what's going on here.Jeremy: (hesitant) Yeah, yeah. She's in D.C. with her mom or something.Matt: So she can't pick up?! I sent her, like, 300 e-mails this summer, and she writes back twice. Did I do something to piss her off?Jeremy: I don't know. She hasn't mentioned anything.Matt: Jer, look. I need you to help me get in contact with her, okay? I haven't slept, okay? I'm scared I'm going crazy here. I need her help.Jeremy: I got to go.Matt: What? Where?"
32171,Elena," So, Mr. ""So Far, So Good,"" Mr. ""I Can Handle My Brother,"" Mr. ""I Know What I'm Doing.""Damon: Hey. I never said I know what I'm doing.Elena: Hmm."
32172,Damon," Who are you calling?Elena: Bonnie. A witch did this to him. Maybe a witch can undo it.Damon: I'm on top of it sister. I've called her about 10 times. She hasn't called me back. (He grabs the phone from Elena.) Look. I say until she does, let's just let Stefan be Stefan, fun, carefree, drunk Stefan without a 100 years of vampire guilt on his shoulders."
32173,Elena," That guilt came from a bl*od addiction that might still be hard-wired in his brain.Damon: You take one philosophy class, now you're the queen of nature versus nurture?"
32174,Elena, Hey. Where'd he go?
32175,Damon," You don't see that cute, little waitress anywhere, do you?"
32176,Stefan," Don't scream. (compelling) Don't move. I don't want to hurt you. You seem really nice. It's not like I want to rip your head off, but I keep being told that if I have one taste I won't be able to stop... and although the thought of k*ll you scares the hell out of me, this feeling of hunger that I have inside of me is just so much more powerful."
32177,Damon," Today, I'm the safe brother."
32178,Stefan, What kind of name is 'Honoria Fell'?Damon: Shh. You're kind of the one that k*ll her.Stefan: Oh.
32179,Damon," Hindsight being 20/20, way too much temptation at the bar, so if this Ripper gene is biological, then we need to minimize human contact until we get your brain all witchy-wooed back to normal, so here it is.Stefan: So, this is the family crypt, huh?Damon: Mmhmm.Stefan: Anybody here I didn't k*ll?Damon: Well, we've covered our father, who art in hell. (He rings a bell.) Uncle Zach, my bad. (Rings the bell) On the bright side, our mother died of consumption. (Rings the bell.)Stefan: Oh, good."
32180,Damon, Ooh.
32181,(He sees a text from Jeremy that reads," ""I need to talk to you ALONE."")"
32182,Damon," I got to go see a man about a witch. Party on without me. Brother—for you. (He puts a bottle of liquor down.) And this is for you. (Hands the bell to Elena, who was lighting up some candles. Damon leaves.)"
32183,Stefan," Well, I, uh, I certainly hope your family history was happier than mine.Elena: Well, let's see. In the last 3 years, I lost my adoptive parents, my birth parents, my aunt, our guardian Alaric and my brother Jeremy died, although he came back to life, so there's that.Stefan: Wait. Jeremy that lives in our house?Elena: Yeah. After I had a breakdown and b*rned my house to the ground.Stefan: Hmm."
32184,Elena," What?Stefan: How do I not remember you? I mean, you're smart, you're pretty, you're funny. Obviously, you're the strongest woman in the world if you managed to figure out a way to get through all that."
32185,Elena," I surround myself with amazing people who help me through it. Like you. You're one of those people.Stefan: So, bonded by death? Please don't tell me that we met in a cemetery."
32186,Stefan," Really? We met in a cemetery?Elena: Well, no. Officially, we met somewhere else first, but, um, you want to see?Stefan: Yeah, sure."
32187,Jeremy," Hello.Damon: Jeremy Gilbert picks up. Wow. It's a Remembrance Day miracle. Now tell me you found Bonnie because I have a hungry vampire who forgot that he's the hero of the story.Jeremy: I need you to come meet me, and I need you to come alone.Damon: And I need you to be less vague and less weird.Jeremy: I know where Bonnie is. Get over here and I'll explain."
32188,Elena," Anything?Stefan: No. Sorry.Elena: Actually, I think you were coming from that direction (she points behind her) because I remember looking that way, so maybe if we switch...Stefan: Sure."
32189,Elena, This is where we collided. Let's try again. Shall we?
32190,Stefan," Hey, Elena. As frustrating as it is for me not to have any memories, I really don't think that re-creating the time we met is magically gonna bring it all back.Elena: Yeah, I know. Right. I'm sorry. I... It's just that seeing you like this is so... strange.Stefan: I'm strange? You were the one coming out of the men's bathroom. Do I even want to know why?Elena: Let's just say I was having a pretty horrible first day."
32191,Elena," I want to show you something. Come on.Stefan: Yeah, sure.Elena: Come on."
32192,Elena," Close your eyes.Stefan: You close your eyes.Elena: (smiling) Come on, Stefan. Trust me.Stefan: All right."
32193,Elena, All right. You can open them. The view's great! Come on up.
32194,Stefan, How the hell do I get up there?Elena: Jump. Just push off with every ounce of strength that you have.Stefan: Okay.
32195,Stefan," All right. Well, I have to admit that was, uh—that was actually pretty amazing.Elena: You're the one who whooshed me to the top of a Ferris wheel once before I was a vampire.Stefan: Right. You mean, when we dated.Elena: I thought Damon hadn't gotten to that part.Stefan: I may have amnesia, but I'm not an idiot. I'm a 164-year-old vampire who went back to high school, so I'm guessing that had something to do with you.Elena: Uh, yeah.Stefan: And obviously we're not together anymore, so I have a feeling me ripping people's heads off might have been a little bit of a turn-off.Elena: Actually, no. You were the most compassionate person I'd ever met. You hated the idea of hurting anyone. The guilt would overwhelm you. You were always in control.Stefan: So, I bored you to death?"
32196,Elena," No. Stefan, it wasn't you. It was me. Becoming a vampire changed me.Stefan: How'd you become a vampire?Elena: Why don't I show you? (He nods.) Meet me down there?Stefan: Okay."
32197,Jesse," Togavirus. Go.Caroline: Togavirus causes congenital rubella, whatever that is.Jesse: Okay, hot sh*t. Red Queen Theory.Caroline: A theory often used to explain the contradictory relationship between predator and prey.Jesse: And why does the supposedly weaker species always stay one step ahead?Caroline: Fear of extinction. (She sits up and looks at Jesse.) The rabbit is faster than the fox because the fox is chasing its dinner. The rabbit's running for its life.Jesse: Damn. If Maxfield doesn't let you in, you can have my spot. (She chuckles.) How did you learn all that so quickly?Caroline: Well, whenever anyone tells me I can't do something, I prove them wrong.Jesse: Is that why you invited me here? To prove to your boyfriend you don't need him?Caroline: I don't know where my boyfriend is. That would require communication and mutual interest and respect, and I invited you here because you're smart and you're nice, and I don't know, I just kind of wanted to hang out with you today."
32198,Jesse, I think that guy is doing a keg-stand on his grandad's grave.Caroline: What?
32199,Jesse," Uh, sorry. I've just kind of wanted to do that since move-in day. Aplastic anemia. Go.Caroline: Aplastic anemia..."
32200,Damon, Okay. Where is she? Call her. Get her here.Jeremy: That's the problem. I can't actually call her. No one can.
32201,Bonnie," Please don't do this, Jeremy.Jeremy: I've been lying to everyone for months, and I can't keep lying knowing that everyone's waiting for her to swoop in and save the day.Damon: I don't speak ""crazy-person,"" Jer. You're gonna have to translate that for me.Jeremy: Think about it, Damon. I was dead. I wasn't supposed to come back.Damon: Yes, exactly. The beauty of Bonnie magic, which is what we need right now.Jeremy: You're not hearing me. Magic finds a balance. I'm not supposed to be here."
32202,Damon," No.Jeremy: You can't just bring sombody back from the dead. There is always a price to pay for it.Damon: Don't say it, Jeremy. Don't you dare.Jeremy: She didn't show up to her dad's funeral, Damon. Nobody has spoken to her all summer.Bonnie: Please, Jeremy.Damon: You say it, and everything in Elena's life goes to crap, do you understand me? Everything changes.Bonnie: Do not say it, Jeremy.Damon: Don't.Jeremy: Bonnie's dead.Damon: Damn it, Jeremy! You realize what you just did?! (He starts walking away from Jeremy.) Why would you say that?!Jeremy: I'm sorry. People need to know."
32203,Stefan," How is it cosmically possible to get into two accidents on the same bridge?Elena: I don't know. Maybe it was fate drawing me back, saying that I cheated death the first time.Stefan: But if I was there both times, then why didn't I save you both times?Elena: Because the second time you saved my best friend Matt because I asked you to.Stefan: Ah. Got it. So, I'm an idiot.Elena: No. You were the perfect boyfriend. You valued what I wanted even if it wasn't what you agreed with."
32204,Stefan," Well, it's gonna take me a minute to wrap my head around that."
32205,Elena," Fair enough.Stefan: It's working, you know?"
32206,Elena," You're remembering?Stefan: No. I mean, this, whatever we're doing, the distracting, the subliminating, whatever you wanna call it. The urge to feed has settled. I'm not, uh, hungry anymore.Elena: Good.Stefan: Whatever monster I was capable of being, I could see why I was different around you.Elena: You were never a monster.Stefan: Elena, I saw my reflection in the mirror today. I was scared of me.Elena: Well, you never scared me. The first time I saw you for what you were, I touched your face like this (she places both her hands on his face), and I told you not to hide."
32207,Stefan, Don't.
32208,Elena, I'm with Damon.
32209,Stefan, You're with my brother.Elena: Yeah.Stefan: And neither of you thought that was something that I should know?Elena: We weren't hiding it from you. It's not that—I'm sorry. I just...
32210,Stefan," And just like that, the hunger returns.Elena: I'm sorry, Stefan."
32211,"(Matt's cellphone rings, waking him up. He answers his phone.)Matt"," Hello?(One second later, his eyes are completely black. Gregor has taken over.)Gregor/Matt: Děkuji, Kristof. [Thank you, Kristof.]"
32212,Gregor/Matt," Cestování bezpecné. [Travel safely.](Gregor/Matt hangs up and puts the phone down on the coffee table. He notices the camera and walks towards it. He grabs the kn*fe from the desk. He talks to the camera.)Gregor/Matt: Hello, Matt Donovan. I'm the passenger inside you. I know you have many questions, but all you need to know is that one day my friends will come looking for this blade. Protect it at all costs... (He slices his hand with the kn*fe. He shows the cut hand to the camera.) ...or this will be your throat."
32213,Elena," Hey! Where are you? I've been calling.Damon: I'm at home. Look. I really need to talk to you about something.Elena: Damon, Stefan's gone.Damon: What? What happened?Elena: I told him about you and me, and he just—he stormed off and said that he was hungry. Damon, there's an entire graveyard full of people here tonight.Damon: Okay. I'm on my way."
32214,Caroline," Stefan?Stefan: Caroline Forbes, my best friend.Caroline: What, you recognize me?Stefan: Well, I've studied pictures. You're much hotter in person. (He drinks some more.) Sorry. I'm—I'm a little drunk.Caroline: Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. Are you okay?Stefan: Well, if by 'okay' you mean heavily spiraling into Ripper oblivion, then yes, I'm dandy.Jesse: Keg-stand guy passed out, so I stole these. (He appears with two cups.)Caroline: (to Jesse) Hey. Do you mind just giving us a couple minutes?Stefan: Yeah. It's probably a good idea because I can sense from here that you have a paper cut on the palm of your left hand, and I want to rip your entire arm off.Caroline: Stefan! (to Jesse, compelling) Go away, hide. I'll find you."
32215,Caroline," Look. I know that you're hungry, but you don't do people, okay? It just—it doesn't end well.Stefan: What about bl*od bags? Do you have any bl*od bags?Caroline: Yes. In the car. Come with me."
32216,Jesse," (on the phone) Hey, Caroline. It's Jesse. I don't know what's going on, but for some reason, I'm in a crypt in the cemetery, and I have no idea why."
32217,Stefan," There. That wasn't so bad, was it? I did it. I stopped.Jesse: I don't know what you are man, but–Stefan: Oh, I'm a Ripper. You know what that means? That means I literally can't stop feeding until I rip someone's head off. But look at us. We're working it out.Jesse: Let me out of here, please.Stefan: I know I should let you out. I'm good, right? I'm compassionate. I live with this burning hunger inside of me that allows me to stay in control, but what do I have to show for it, huh?Jesse: I don't know you, man.Stefan: I have no memories because my brain was fried. My brother, who's been my brother for 160-some-odd years, stole my girlfriend, and my girlfriend let him, so you tell me... (Stefan sheds a tear) ...what's the point of being good?"
32218,Jeremy," I've been knocking.Matt: Yeah, I noticed. So, you're not gonna believe this, but–Jeremy: Matt, wait. There's something I need to tell you. It's about Bonnie.Matt: What? Is she back? (Jeremy doesn't respond and just stares at Matt.) What, Jer?"
32219,Caroline," Hey! Stefan, stop!"
32220,Caroline," This isn't you, okay? You might not remember, but I do. You are better than this. You are not this person.Stefan: I have to go.Caroline: What?Stefan: I have to leave.Caroline: Stefan."
32221,Caroline," Oh, my God. (She bites her wrist and offers it to Jesse.) Jesse, Jesse, drink this. You'll be okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got you into this, and I'm sorry I let you kiss me when I– I'm just sorry."
32222,Elena," Stefan. There you are. We've been looking everywhere for y–Damon: What you doing there, brother?Stefan: Well, you know, just tying up a few odds and ends.Damon: You sure you want to do that?Stefan: Well, I know what I don't want. I don't want to be the person in these journals anymore. I don't want to live in this house. I don't want my brother's advice. I don't want to hear how I supported you, Elena, and I definitely do not want to continue this conversation."
32223,Elena," Stefan, wait.Stefan: Don't worry. I'm not gonna go on a Ripper binge. Besides, Carolina said she'd call me every hour to make sure I was okay and, uh... I actually do trust her.Elena: But..."
32224,Damon," I think we just got dumped.Elena: We need Bonnie. Why hasn't she called us back? It's so unlike her. He can't stay like this.Damon: Elena, Bonnie can't help us.Elena: Did you talk to her? What did she say? There's got to be something that she can do. I mean, she'll figure it out. She always does."
32225,Damon," Bonnie's dead, Elena.Elena: What?!Damon: She's dead. I'm sorry."
32226,Caroline," Hey. How you feeling?Stefan: Hmm. I'm feeling better, which in my world means I haven't committed a homicide since I last saw you. I've been doing a lot of thinking today, a lot of wandering around, and this seemed like the most appropriate place to come. (He looks at Caroline.) What's wrong?Caroline: It's Bonnie. My friend, our friend. She's dead.Stefan: Uh... What—what happened?Caroline: Please don't ask because then I'm going to have to try to come up with an answer, which means I'm gonna have to actually think about it, and then I'll start crying, and I'm afraid that I might not ever be able to stop.Stefan: Hmm."
32227,Stefan," I'm sorry. I... I wish that I could remember her.Caroline: I don't know. Part of me just wishes that I could trade places with you because without all the memories, maybe it wouldn't hurt so damn much.Stefan: It's okay.Caroline: It's not. I'm never gonna see her again, and I have no idea where Tyler is, and I just got so used to them being there all the time, and now what? I'm supposed to just learn to move on without them? How do I do that when all I have is this sadness and this anger and–Stefan: Me. You have me. Look. You were there for me last night. Sounds like you're always there for me. (He places his hand on hers.) So let me be there for you, okay?"
32228,Damon," Hey.Elena: (Still going through her clothes.) I don't have any clothes. I have nothing to wear. I mean, I b*rned my house down with all of my funeral clothes in it. I'm supposed to be strong, I'm supposed to have learned how to handle this, but... (She starts crying) ...I can't. I can't keep doing this, Damon. Stefan's gone, Bonnie's dead. She gave up her life so that I could have my brother back, and I didn't even know about it.Damon: I know.Elena: I can't believe this is happening."
32229,Elena, I can't believe she's gone.Damon: I'm so sorry. (He strokes her hair.) I'm sorry.
32230,Bonnie, It's okay. They need this. I need this.
32231,Jeremy," We ring this bell in honor of Bonnie, in remembrance for her. (He rings the bell and places it back on the stump.) I'm not sure what else to say.Bonnie: Say that I'm not going anywhere, say that even though they couldn't see me I've been there the whole time.Jeremy: She says that she's not going anywhere, that she has been here all along. Bonnie has watched you have the summer of your life."
32232,Bonnie," And I saw you happy, and I know you think now that you can't have a normal life...Bonnie & Jeremy: that you have to be there for everyone, but you don't.Bonnie: (to Elena) Everyone will find their way, so you are gonna repack your things, you're gonna go back to college, and you're gonna live it up. (to Matt) You didn't do anything wrong, Matt. You know I would have sent you 300 e-mails back if I could. I miss you.Bonnie & Jeremy: (to Caroline) Caroline...Bonnie: I watched you decorate that dorm room like your life depended on it. (They laugh.) And I know that college isn't everything you expected and that you feel like something's missing, but... Tyler..."
32233,Bonnie, (to Jeremy) This is good. This is all I wanted. I'll be okay. We'll all be okay.
32234,Dr. Maxfield," Your vitals are normalJesse: Don't sound so disappointed.Dr. Maxfield: Tell me about your night.Jesse: Caroline Forbes took me to a party in Mystic Falls, and then...it's kind of a big blank. I must have been really drunk.Dr. Maxfield: What's causing your memory loss didn't come in a red cup. It appears you have vampire bl*od in your system, Jesse, which means you were either injured to the point of needing to be healed, or someone wants to turn you into a vampire. I'm guessing the former, and then I'm guessing you were compelled to forget.Jesse: I'm sorry. What?"
32235,Dr. Maxfield, It's nothing to worry about. The good news about having vampire bl*od in your system is that's step one to creating a new vampire. (He pulls out a needle.) This is step two.
32236,Jesse," Dr. Maxfield, please. Why are you doing this? My insides, they're burning up. I'm hungry"
32237,Dr.Maxfield," Subject 62547. After his initial transition, 62547 has undergone 3 day without feeding. Subject is weak but lucid. Upper left and right cusped normal after bl*od stimulus is removed"
32238,Jesse, What are you doing to me?
32239,Dr.Maxfield, Pupils are at full dilation. Sensitivity to light… sensitivity to light an obvious 11 on a scale from one to 10
32240,Jesse, What the hell is happening to me? Why am I so hungry? What are you doing to me?
32241,Dr. Maxfield, Subject is confused yet self-aware. Personality seems intact. Hunger remains primary focus. All in all appears to be a perfect candidate
32242,Elena," Dear diary, do you ever get sick of me writing about death?It's been 4 days since Bonnie died… or 4 days since I found out Bonnie died. She wanted me to go back to school, so here I am, back at school… studying, going to class, trying to move on like everyone else. Stefan had it easiest. He doesn't even remember Bonnie, not that anybody has seen him except for Caroline, who's back with Tyler. He's been a healthy distraction for her, to say the least... And I've adopted my own distraction… Dr. Wes Maxfield. My roommate was k*ll by a vampire. Dr. Maxfield covered it up, and I'd like to know why"
32243,Elena, I wouldn’t miss it
32244,Elena," Besides, the more I have to think about, the less time I have to miss Bonnie..."
32245,Bonnie," I'm right here, Elena, and I miss you, too"
32246,Elena," But in the meantime, I choose to believe that she's watching over me because that's who Bonnie is"
32247,Damon, Busted
32248,Elena, Hey
32249,Damon," Hey, miss avoiding me for 3 days"
32250,Elena, Avoiding you? What? We've been talking
32251,Damon," Texting. One time. ""Want to be my plus one at a costume ball?"" Winky face"
32252,Elena," And you never replied. So I'm guessing this special, in-person visit means yes"
32253,Damon, Definitely will maybe consider thinking about it
32254,Elena, It's at 8:00. Caroline got us costumes
32255,Damon, Where you going?
32256,Elena, To class. I’m late
32257,Caroline," Oh, before I forget, I talked to the registrar, and your major is-- drum roll--Sociology..."
32258,Tyler, How about we don't talk about my major right now?
32259,Caroline, And I compelled you a single
32260,Tyler, Definitely don't want to talk about my dorm room
32261,Caroline," Well, we could talk about the hybrid-sized jerk that you've been for not calling me back ever"
32262,Tyler, How many times do you want me to tell you? I've been helping a werewolf pack in the land of no cell phone reception
32263,Caroline," Well, lucky for you, I figured out a way for you to make up for it"
32264,Tyler, I thought I did make up for it a couple dozen times
32265,Caroline, You are escorting me to the Whitmore historical ball
32266,Tyler, The what?
32267,Caroline," It's the one time a year where they put their whole collection on display and everyone dresses up as famous historical figures. I got Stefan a costume. Even he's going. Come on, Tyler. I mean, how cute will we be as Bonnie and Clyde?"
32268,Tyler, Seriously?
32269,Caroline, You're right. Let's not talk
32270,Elena, Hey
32271,Aaron, Hey
32272,Elena, I'm Elena. Megan used to be my roommate. Did you know her?
32273,Aaron, We knew each other growing up
32274,Elena," Oh, wow. I'm sorry. Pretty sad memorial, huh?"
32275,Aaron, Guess it's not exactly cool to mourn during fall rush
32276,Elena, Everyone mourns differently. Some do flowers. Other do what their loved ones would've wanted
32277,Aaron," Yeah. Well, what Megan would have wanted was to still be here alive"
32278,Elena, They said she committed su1c1de
32279,Aaron, Yeah. I know. That's what they said
32280,Elena, So then what do you think happened?
32281,Aaron," Yeah. If you care about her, get her sunflowers. She liked those"
32282,Elena," Hey, do you have a name?"
32283,Aaron, Yeah. I do
32284,Nadia," Cut to the chase, Silas. What do you want?"
32285,Silas, I want Katherine Pierce. What do you think I want?
32286,Nadia," So do I, which is why I took her away from you. You can have your brown-eyed bitch of a cure for immortality when I'm done"
32287,Silas, But you've had her all night long. So how much longer do you need?
32288,Nadia, Aren't you immortal? What's a few more hours to you?
32289,Silas," Here's the thing, Nadia. I don't really care about what you need. I only care about what I need. I'm a little selfish like that"
32290,Nadia, Then why don't you mind-control a whole town of people and find out where I'm holding her? Right. You can't
32291,Silas," I'm very well aware of my current super power predicament, thank you very much, and even though my brain is on the Fritz, thanks to an ex-fiancée stalker witch who can't seem to take a hint, that doesn't mean that I'm not still brilliant and crafty and becoming rapidly well-versed in the power of cell phone tracking"
32292,Katherine," Little tip, woman to woman… don't piss off the diabolical ones, and if you're gonna hold me hostage, the least you can do is feed my properly"
32293,Nadia, We'll eat lunch on the road. Let's get out of here
32294,Katherine," Or just hand me over, let him take his little sip of my bl*od so that he can cure himself of immortality, and we can all be on our merry way back to finer accommodations"
32295,Nadia," A little tip, woman to woman… don't offer to hand yourself over to the diabolical ones when you don't know the whole story"
32296,Katherine, Indulge me. What's the whole story?
32297,Nadia, Silas needs more than just a sip to cure himself. He needs every last drop of your bl*od in your body
32298,Katherine," But I'm a human now. If he did that, then…"
32299,Nadia, You die. Now come on. Let's go
32300,Damon," So, as we know, in a psychotic lapse of judgment, Bonnie brought you back to life and died in the process. May she rest in peace"
32301,Jeremy, She's actually right over there
32302,Damon," Whatever. Look. The whole point is, I just happen to know a supernatural being who just happens to want to die, and in the spirit of nature needing balance and life for a life and all that stuff, I just think it would be a huge waste of a perfectly good death"
32303,Jeremy, What are you talking about?
32304,Damon, Something Elena doesn't need to know about until it works
32305,Jeremy, Wait. You want to work with Silas?
32306,Silas, So... Why did you call me?
32307,Damon," Same reason you answered. You need help, and I'm gonna help you"
32308,Damon," From the beginning, Silas' whole bad-guy plan was to k*ll himself, pass on to wherever he was gonna pass on to, and reunite with his dead girlfriend Amara I want to use his death to bring Bonnie back to life"
32309,Silas, What makes you think that I need help?
32310,Damon," Well, for starters, you're still here, as in why do you suck so badly at k*ll yourself?"
32311,Damon," To die, he has to be mortal. If he's mortal, then he's a witch, and if he dies as a witch, then he's stuck on the other side forever"
32312,Jeremy, He already tried to bring down the veil to the other side. He failed
32313,Bonnie," Maybe he has a plan ""B."" Maybe he wants to do more than just drop the veil and let all the ghosts out"
32314,Damon," She knows I can't hear her, right?"
32315,Jeremy, She thinks Silas wants to destroy the other side completely
32316,Bonnie," Powerful spells are bound by something even more powerful… the moon, a comet, a doppelganger. The other side was made 2,000 years ago, and it still exists. That means she must have bound it to something that could exist just as long"
32317,Silas," A mystical anchor. That's what binds her spell to the other side. I want to destroy it. Qetsiyah, or Tessa or whatever the hell she's calling herself these days, she wants to protect it. So she's the only person that knows where the anchor is hidden, but fortunately, she will be at the Whitmore historical ball this evening"
32318,Damon, Really? Thought you said you lost all of your psychic powers
32319,Silas," Oh, I did, but I still have my incredible powers of observation, and I observed her buying a Cleopatra costume today"
32320,Damon," Back to my original question, let's say Silas destroys the other side, cures himself, becomes a witch. Is it supernaturally possible that he can do a spell that swaps her life for his life once he… pfft… k*ll himself?"
32321,Bonnie," Supernaturally, yeah, it's possible, but this is the same Silas who m*rder my father. He's ruthless, and whatever spell he could do, there'll be some consequences. There always is. So no. My answer is, definitely not"
32322,Damon, What'd she say? Tell me?
32323,Jeremy, She's in
32324,Bonnie, What?
32325,Damon, So we have a deal
32326,Silas," Well, we have half a deal. I'm resurrecting some witch with my death, but we have yet to discuss how you're helping me"
32327,Damon," Well, you've yet to tell me what you want"
32328,Silas," Oh, it's fairly simple, actually. I want you to k*ll your brother"
32329,Nadia, I've been tailing you for 500 years. There are a few things I'd like to clear up
32330,Katherine, Why would I tell you anything?
32331,Nadia," You indulge me in some answers, and I will let you go"
32332,Katherine, Really? My freedom in exchange for a little Q&A? Hmm. Ok
32333,Nadia," In 1864, there was a vampire roundup in Mystic Falls"
32334,Katherine, Was there? I'm bad with dates
32335,Nadia," Word on the street is that you sold out many vampires, including your best friend Pearl and her daughter Annabelle"
32336,Katherine," I was running from Klaus. I needed to jet solo. I threw a couple of vampire names on the hit list. Sue me. I also impersonated a teenager to get my ex-boyfriends to make out with me, staged a fake fight to trigger my lover's werewolf curse, ooh, and I chopped off this douchey guy's fingers with a butcher kn*fe once. That was cool"
32337,Nadia," What about ripping a mother away from her daughter, having her k*ll for your own benefit?"
32338,Katherine, What are you getting at?
32339,Nadia," Now a little bit about me. I had myself turned into a vampire to hunt you, to even the playing field, to track your every move for however long it took me until I found you, and I did this because you k*ll my mother. It happened in Paris, 1645"
32340,Katherine, I go to Paris for shoes. The shoes I remember. Everything else requires a few more details
32341,Nadia," Her name was Lily Atoma. You were on the run from Klaus. She took you in, but when his minions showed up, you pointed at my mom, and you said, ""That is Katerina Petrova. She is the one you want."" So they took her away"
32342,Katherine," You were never gonna let me go, were you?"
32343,Nadia," No, but I'd hate for you to die on an empty stomach. Time to go"
32344,Bonnie, You need to call Damon and tell him you lied
32345,Jeremy," So I can lie for you all summer as your witch translator, but when it's something I want…"
32346,Bonnie, Silas is too dangerous
32347,Jeremy," And bringing me back to life wasn't? Oh, right, it k*ll you"
32348,Bonnie, I brought you back because Elena needed you
32349,Jeremy, Now she needs you
32350,Bonnie," What about the consequences? Haven't we learned this by now? When you abuse magic, there's always a price"
32351,Jeremy, What is worse than this? What is worse than seeing you and hearing you... And not being able to feel you? This isn't enough anymore. Let Damon try to bring you back
32352,Tyler," Wow. All of this, and you weren't even on the dance committee"
32353,Caroline, I may have e-mailed them a few suggestions
32354,Tyler, Did I mention you're the hottest serial k*ll in here?
32355,Caroline," Well, considering the crowd, I'll take that as a compliment"
32356,Tyler, I thought you got Stefan a costume
32357,Caroline," He's James Dean. I went easy on him. I figured, between the bl*od lust drama, the Damon-Elena drama, the abuser drama, he's been through enough"
32358,Stefan," Hey, dance with me. I'm buzzed, and I'm on the verge of having a good time"
32359,Tyler, Have fun. I'll get us drinks
32360,Damon," Lady Anne Boleyn. Now, who in their right mind would cut off a head so gorgeous?"
32361,Elena," Uh, you, my King, my not-so-loving husband"
32362,Damon," Well, maybe I can dance my way out of this doghouse"
32363,Elena," Yeah, maybe. Maybe later"
32364,Damon," Ooh, or maybe you can tell me what's going on with you. Come on"
32365,Elena," Bonnie died 3 months ago, and what was I doing? I was having the summer of my life with you"
32366,Damon," Ah, guilt. Don't know it, but I've heard it can be a real bitch"
32367,Elena," I know that it's not my fault that Bonnie died, but it is my fault for not figuring it out sooner"
32368,Damon," Elena, you are allowed to be happy once in a blue moon. Besides, Jeremy was lying to us all summer"
32369,Elena," I should've figured it out, Damon. I know that it's not the same, but I'm not gonna let Megan's death fall through the cracks, too"
32370,Damon, Who the hell is that?
32371,Elena," It's Megan's hometown friend, i.e. the latest person of interest in the Whitmore mystery. I'll be right back"
32372,Elena," Hey, whatever your name is. Nice T-shirt, understated"
32373,Aaron," Hey, whatever you're supposed to be"
32374,Elena," Anne Boleyn, pre-beheading, obviously"
32375,Aaron, Impressed
32376,Elena," So does a costume compliment earn me like, a formal introduction?"
32377,Aaron, Why do you want to know who I am?
32378,Elena, Did you k*ll Megan?
32379,Aaron, Of course not
32380,Elena, Then why are you acting so shady?
32381,Aaron," Because everyone around me dies. It's like a curse. My friends, my family… one by one, I've lost every single person in my life. So if you had any idea what survivor's guilt felt like, you'd leave me alone"
32382,Elena, Forget about my questions
32383,Aaron, It's Aaron. My name. I'll see you around maybe
32384,Tessa," Where I come from, open bar meant ceramic jugs of Phoenician wine"
32385,Stefan, Ok
32386,Tessa," You have no idea who I am, do you?"
32387,Stefan," No offense, but actually, I have no idea who a lot of people are"
32388,Tessa," Tessa, formerly known as Qetsiyah"
32389,Stefan, The girl who wiped my memories
32390,Tessa," Nothing personal, little ex-boyfriend drama. Let me make it up to you, buy you an ""I'm sorry"" drink"
32391,Damon," More like an ""I'm sorry"" keg. Come on"
32392,Stefan," You, my brother, make a terrible wingman"
32393,Damon, Trust me; last guy to hit on her is still paying for it
32394,Stefan," So what, exactly, are we doing here?"
32395,Damon, Well…
32396,Silas, Hello me
32397,Damon, So you want to explain to me why I just k*ll my brother?
32398,Silas," Well, Tessa's spell mentally linked us. I lost my psychic abilities. Stefan lost his memories"
32399,Damon, And this severed the link?
32400,Silas," Yes, Damon. I can read your mind again. No. I'm not lying, and maybe you enjoyed breaking your brother's neck just a little bit too much"
32401,Damon, Sold
32402,Silas," I'll cozy up to the witch and sift through her mind, figure out where she's hiding the anchor, and you, all you got to do is keep him dead"
32403,Damon, Isn't Tess gonna be slightly suspicious when the man whose brain she just fried is all of a sudden showing interest in her?
32404,Silas," Of all the men here, Tessa went straight for Stefan.This face won her heart before. See, a woman never forgets her first love, no matter how badly it ended"
32405,Tessa," Ah, look who's back. Am I in trouble?"
32406,Silas," Well, according to my brother, I am supposed to hate you"
32407,Tessa, And do you?
32408,Silas, I'll tell you after that drink. Good. You like Tequila
32409,Tessa," Yes, but not as much as bacon. In my day, it was all about lamb. No one thought to cure pig fat"
32410,Silas," God, you have the most beautiful smile"
32411,Tessa," You gonna stare at it all night, or are you gonna ask me to dance?"
32412,Caroline," Hey, you want to get out of here? These costumes come with handcuffs, and you have a single"
32413,Tyler," Look, Care. I didn't just come back here to get you in bed"
32414,Caroline, I know. It's just... A happy by-product of us being in school together
32415,Tyler, No. I mean…
32416,Caroline, What?
32417,Tyler, I'm just really glad to be here
32418,Silas, So what brings you to a college costume ball?
32419,Tessa," Look at me. Last time I looked this good, I couldn't enjoy it"
32420,Silas," Oh, that's right, the whole ""being stood up at your wedding"" thing"
32421,Tessa, You shouldn't know that. I told you that before I fried your memories
32422,Silas, Ok. You got me. I might have asked around about you
32423,Tessa," And I'm paranoid. That's what I get for trying to marry a lying, manipulative bastard"
32424,Silas," Oh, come on. The guy must've had some redeeming qualities. I mean, we know he was obviously extremely good-looking...But, I mean, was the guy at least funny?"
32425,Tessa, Are you defending him?
32426,Silas," No, no. It's just that you've been on this revenge kick for 2,000 years, and maybe hating him is an excuse to keep him in your life. There's a part of you that still loves him"
32427,Tessa," Now, I really hope he thinks that. I want to see his face when he realizes just how wrong he is"
32428,Silas," Ok. I got to admit, there's a part of me that just wanted to hear you say that you still love me.That's how big my ego is, but since you're obviously in denial…"
32429,Tessa," Oh, my God, Silas…"
32430,Silas," Now, where's the anchor to the other side?"
32431,Tessa," I don't know. I'm looking for it, too"
32432,Silas," What do you mean, you don't know? You created it"
32433,Tessa," Yes, I created it, but the Travelers hid it after they k*ll me. They move it constantly"
32434,Silas, So what are you doing here?
32435,Tessa, My pendant is in one of these displays. It's a magical talisman that enhances my powers. I need it to do a locator spell so I can find the anchor
32436,Silas," Well, then get to it and forget everything we just spoke about"
32437,Tessa, Thank you for the dance
32438,Silas, Thank you
32439,Stefan," Hey, hey, breaking my neck, huh?"
32440,Damon, Yeah
32441,Stefan,Pumping me full of Vervain. All we need is a Damon-sized rationalization
32442,Damon," Oh, the new you sucks"
32443,Stefan," How would the old me deal with this, barrel full of laughs?"
32444,Damon, He'd know it wasn't about him
32445,Stefan," Oh, who's it about, Damon, huh, about you, your desperation to prove to Elena that you're a worthy boyfriend?"
32446,Damon," I'm gonna get her best friend back, ok?"
32447,Katherine, There you are. Having trouble getting that out? I grazed your heart on purpose
32448,Nadia, Which means you didn't want me dead? You still want something
32449,Katherine, I do. I want to know why you made up that fake story about your mom
32450,Nadia, It was a test. You failed
32451,Katherine," I knew it was a fake story. By 1645, I'd been running from Klaus for a century and a half. There's no way any of his minions would have mistaken anyone for me, but you know how my brain works, right? So you must have known that I wouldn't have fallen for that sob story"
32452,Nadia," I wanted to get under your skin, and it worked because here you are"
32453,Katherine, What kind of sick game are you playing?
32454,Nadia," It's not a game, Katherine. You did k*ll my mother, only it wasn't in Paris. It was in a little cottage in England, and it wasn't 1645. It was April 6, 1492, and she was all alone, exiled by her family two years earlier. You stuck her head in a noose, pushed her off the chair, and snapped her neck"
32455,Katherine, Who are you?
32456,Nadia, My name... is Nadia Petrova... And you're my mother
32457,Katherine, Uh... no
32458,Dr. Maxfield, You look like a woman on her way to the guillotine
32459,Elena," Actually, she was beheaded with a sword"
32460,Dr. MAxfield, See? And that's why I teach Bio
32461,Elena, And you are Abe Lincoln?
32462,Dr. Maxfield, Dr. Jekyll
32463,Elena," Ah, ok. Yeah. I can see that. So where's Mr. Hyde?"
32464,Dr. Maxfield, I don't know. I'm not responsible for my darker half
32465,Elena, So would it be totally inappropriate if a student asked you to dance?
32466,Dr. Maxfield," Who could refuse a Queen? Besides, you're not, nor will you ever be, one of my students"
32467,Elena," Major points for the dance moves, but zero points for lying on my roommate's death certificate "
32468,Dr. Maxfield," Look. I didn't want to lie, but I couldn't exactly tell her parents a mountain lion attacked her at a frat party. I'd be fired. Want to know my theory?"
32469,Elena, What's that? 
32470,Dr. Maxfield," I think a vampire hunted her down, ripped her throat out, and threw her off that roof"
32471,Elena, What do you know about vampires? 
32472,Dr. Maxfield," Doesn't matter what I know, Elena, because we're never gonna see each other again"
32473,Elena, And why is that?
32474,Dr. Maxfield,"Because there are people at this school watching you and your friends and asking questions you don't want them to ask. So pack your things, drop out, and move back to Mystic Falls"
32475,Caroline, Hey… Here you are. What are you doing?
32476,Tyler," Look, Care… I can't do the college thing right now"
32477,Caroline," Yeah. I completely understand. I have been pushing way too hard, and, you know, you need to make your own decisions. Point is, you're back, and we're together"
32478,Tyler," Do you know the reason we're together? It's because Klaus granted us permission to be together. I'm sorry, but I can't live like that"
32479,Caroline, I see. So this is about Klaus
32480,Tyler, No. This is about me. He k*ll my mom and got away with it. I can't just start caring about sociology and frat parties
32481,Caroline, You haven't even given it a chance
32482,Tyler, I didn't come here to give it a chance
32483,Caroline, You came here to say good-bye
32484,Tyler, I need to go after him. I need to find a way to destroy his life like he destroyed mine
32485,Caroline," You know what, Tyler? For someone who hates Klaus, you certainly sound a lot like him"
32486,Tessa, Stefan. Come to see the show?
32487,Silas, What are you doing?
32488,Tessa," I'm using this pendant to find something I'm looking for, and I found it"
32489,Silas, Good
32490,Tessa, Stefan?
32491,Damon, You awake? Stefan? You alive again?
32492,Stefan," How does it feel, brother?"
32493,Tessa," Stefan… Stefan, are you ok?"
32494,Stefan," Tessa, that's Silas"
32495,Tessa, No
32496,Stefan, He's working with my brother. Everything he said to you was a lie
32497,Tessa, That's all he knows how to do… lie. You know where the anchor is. Too bad you won't be around to find it.
32498,Silas, You can't k*ll me
32499,Tessa, I don't have to k*ll you yet
32500,Silas, You love me. You know you love me
32501,Tessa," I did love you... And then you broke my heart, and now I'm gonna break yours... Or at least stop it from working so your bl*od can't flow and your veins dry up and you rot from the inside out so the world can see you exactly as you are… cold, gray, hideous, you monster"
32502,Dr.Maxfield, Where do you think you're going?
32503,Aaron, What?
32504,Dr.Maxfield, Give them. Come on
32505,Aaron, I’m fine
32506,Dr.Maxfield," He said, releasing molecules of alcohol on his breath"
32507,Aaron," You know, you sound like that dad who thinks he's cool, but isn't"
32508,Dr.Maxfield," Well, I'll settle for that very uncool and mildly responsible legal guardian. Keys...Now"
32509,Aaron," Can I have some money for a cab? I mean, you do manage my trust, right?"
32510,Dr.Maxfield, I saw you talking to Elena Gilbert. Do yourself a favor. Stay away from that one
32511,Aaron, Why?
32512,Dr.Maxfield," Because behind my very uncool exterior, I do care about you, Aaron"
32513,Aaron, Whatever
32514,Dr.Maxfield, Be safe
32515,Elena," Oh, my God. Stefan"
32516,Damon, That ain't Stefan
32517,Elena, Silas? Damn it.What the hell is going on?
32518,Damon, Looks like Tessa had her way with him
32519,Elena," So if that's Silas, then he's not a problem anymore. This is a good thing, right?"
32520,Damon," Actually, no. It's a very, very bad thing"
32521,Nadia, You're a fool not to run. Silas will find you
32522,Katherine," Or he won't. You're the one who said it. I'm pretty good at dodging the diabolical ones. Besides, Silas doesn't need me until he figures out how to destroy the other side. If he cures himself before then, he goes back to being a witch. He dies as a witch, well; he's stuck in supernatural Purgatory. There's just been one outstanding question that's just been nagging at me for the last 500 years. Where were you in 1498?"
32523,Nadia, I don't know. I was 8. Why?
32524,Katherine," Because by 1498, I'd escaped, ditched the people that were chasing me, and found my way back to Bulgaria. I searched every village, every cottage, but I couldn't find you"
32525,Nadia, You went back?
32526,Katherine," Yes, Nadia. I went back for you. It's nice to meet you"
32527,Caroline, Hey
32528,Tyler, Hey. Care…
32529,Caroline," wait. I've been thinking about it, and I've decided that... I'm not going to have this conversation again. I can't just sit here while I'm waiting for you to come back"
32530,Tyler," I don't want that, either"
32531,Caroline, Then stay; just be the love of my life. Just love me more than you hate him
32532,Tyler," I'm sorry, Care. I can't do that"
32533,Caroline," No. No. No! Don't you dare walk away from me. I swear to God, Tyler, if you take one more step, we are done, ok?No more surprises, no more excuses, no more chances. We are done"
32534,Damon, So professor blondie knows about vampires?
32535,Elena," He said that if I don't drop out of school, the wrong people are gonna start asking the right questions"
32536,Damon," Ugh, that's not good. What are you gonna do?"
32537,Elena," I don't know, but all I do know is that finding out the truth about Megan isn't gonna bring Bonnie back"
32538,Damon," Yeah. Well, neither is a desiccated Silas in our living room"
32539,Elena," So the only way for Silas to trade in his life for Bonnie's is if he's a witch, but the only way to become a witch is to have the cure"
32540,Damon, Yep
32541,Elena, What?
32542,Damon," Now, who could that be?"
32543,Damon," Why, hello"
32544,Katherine, What's so urgent? I'm on the run. Don't exactly have time for a pit stop.Or maybe I do. Maybe I have all the time in the world. Katherine Pierce eludes death yet again…and you two finally did something right for once. How does it feel?
32545,Damon, Thrilling
32546,Katherine," Damon, no"
32547,Damon, He needs the cure to become a witch
32548,Katherine," No. No. No, Damon. No, no, please. He need all of my bl*od. It'll k*ll me, Damon. Damon, please, I don't want to die. I don't want to die, Damon. I don't want to die. Please"
32549,Damon," Good-bye, Katherine"
32550,Damon, Do you hear that?
32551,Elena, You've got to be kidding me
32552,Damon," Takes a licking, keeps on ticking"
32553,Katherine, Am I in hell?
32554,Waitress, Sure a little thing like you can eat all that?
32555,Katherine, I'm celebrating. I thought I was gonna die. I didn’t. So now I'm free to be whatever I want to be. Heh. It's a good day
32556,Waitress," Love the hair, by the way. Bold choice"
32557,Elena, This is nice
32558,Damon, It is nice
32559,Elena," Quiet, still, peaceful. I like our life when it's like this"
32560,Damon," But it is our life, which probably means that somebody's gonna walk through that door and shatter it"
32561,Elena," Oh, don't say that"
32562,Damon," In 10, 9..."
32563,Elena, Just let me enjoy the moment
32564,Damon," 6, 5..."
32565,Elena," Damon, today is the day that we're gonna bring Bonnie back. It's a good day"
32566,Damon, 3...2...
32567,Elena," Damon, it's a good day"
32568,Silas, Greetings
32569,Damon, One
32570,Silas," Good morning, frenemies. Ah. You know, I'm only a few hours into my old life as a witch, but somehow, the sun feels warmer. Probably because I'm not cursed with having to outlive it any more"
32571,Damon," What's with the home invasion, Silas?"
32572,Silas," Well, Damon, after 2,000 years of a miserable existence, I finally get to die"
32573,Tessa," Morning, sleepyhead. Sleep well?"
32574,Stefan, Oh. Tessa. Hi
32575,Tessa, You're confused. Is that the amnesia or the Tequila?
32576,Stefan," Um, I think both. I'm still trying to piece together last night"
32577,Tessa, We bonded over our misery. There were body shots. The misery lifted. Here. Berries
32578,Stefan, Thank you. What's got you in such a good mood?
32579,Tessa," I happened to see a text message pop up on your phone after you crashed last night. Warning from your friends. Silas took the cure. He's a witch. He's mortal, and now I can k*ll him. Get up, gorgeous. Your doppelganger dies today"
32580,Silas," We all know that Tessa is a real vengeful bitch. Your doppelganger Amara died at her hands, but today after 2,000 years, Amara and I will finally reunite"
32581,Damon," All right. Skip the mushy parts. Look. My girl here is just trying to have a good day, and there are promises she's expecting you to keep"
32582,Silas, Oh. You don't think that I keep my promises?
32583,Elena, You said that now you're a witch again you would bring Bonnie back from the other side
32584,Silas," I did, and I can"
32585,Elena, And you promised Damon that you would do that if he helped you
32586,Silas, Yeah
32587,Elena, But you're kind of evil. No offense
32588,Silas, None taken
32589,Elena, So I'm just trying to figure out how I can trust that one of your last acts in this world will be to bring my best friend back
32590,Silas, Did you want me to pinky swear?
32591,Damon, She's trying to have a good day. Just tell her how it's gonna go down
32592,Silas," I just want to destroy the other side so I don't get stuck in that pit of a Purgatory when I finally do k*ll myself. Before I do that, I'll bring Bonnie back, and being the amazing and incredible and all-powerful witch that I am, I can totally do both things. I just have to find The Anchor first and destroy it"
32593,Elena, The Anchor?
32594,Tessa," Silas is looking for The Anchor. It's the object I used to bind the spell when I created the other side.Destroy it, the spell's broken. No more supernatural limbo, and Silas can die and find peace. I'd rather his lying, cheating ass not have that"
32595,Stefan," Great, fine. I approve. Where is it?"
32596,Damon, New Jersey? The supernatural other world is bound by an object in Snooki's backyard?
32597,Silas," It's in a stockyard, and it's being shipped out, so we really need to… hello, hunter"
32598,Silas," Banner day for you, huh? Didn't you and the Bennett witch used to… tch, tch"
32599,Jeremy," Hey. Knock it off, ok?"
32600,Elena," It's ok, Jer. We all want the same thing today…"
32601,Damon," Aka, put the damn crossbow down, Pocahontas"
32602,Jeremy, We're just supposed to believe that he's gonna bring Bonnie back to life out of the goodness of his heart?
32603,Silas," Well, I hope not. I mean, I am kind of a monster. You know, guys, I'm feeling really ganged up on right now, ok? I would hate to lose my temper and do something... Crazy. Ahh. Man, I really love being a witch again. I feel like I'm constantly reinventing myself. I'm like a supernatural Madonna, don't you think?"
32604,Stefan, So Silas read your mind and figured out where The Anchor is? Now what?
32605,Tessa," You now that old, ancient story I told you about the Travelers? Oh, wait. You don't. I fried your brain and took your memories. Sorry. The Travelers… you know how Silas wants to destroy the other side so he can be at peace with that slut Amara that he calls his one true love? The Travelers don't want that"
32606,Stefan, Why not?
32607,Tessa, Not important. Scratch that. Very important. I'm just not gonna answer it
32608,Stefan," Um, you know what? I think I still need to be drunk to understand this story"
32609,Tessa," The Travelers have been in possession of The Anchor for 2,000 years. They constantly move it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, and they're not gonna let him get near it, at least not before I k*ll him"
32610,Stefan," Yeah? Well, what if they fail?"
32611,Tessa, He won't destroy it. He won't be able to
32612,Stefan, Why not?
32613,Tessa, Let's just file that under the not gonna answer it category
32614,Silas, All right. We got to get going. You grab a crowbar or 4 from the garage
32615,Jeremy, What for?
32616,Silas, Does it matter?
32617,Silas," You, you're not going. Men only"
32618,Elena, Are you serious? He's not serious
32619,Damon," No, he's not serious"
32620,Silas," Actually, I am 100% serious. She's a freaky carbon copy of my one true love Amara. You can understand why I don't want to stare at her imposter face all day"
32621,Damon, That makes no sense
32622,Silas, If would make complete sense if you were ever in love with anybody who looked exactly like her
32623,Elena, This is ridiculous. We're bringing my best friend back from the dead. I’m going
32624,Silas, Next one goes in the heart. Now hurry up. I only have until sundown before Tessa tries to stop me
32625,Stefan," Well, the one good thing about having amnesia is that I don't remember how I got in the middle of all this"
32626,Tessa," Rest easy, sweet pea. Don't you worry about the details. Silas is going to die today, and he will spend eternity on the other side as far away from Amara and peace as possible. I have it all covered. You don't scheme as long as I have without considering every possibility"
32627,Stefan, What’s wrong?
32628,Tessa, Silas put a spell on this cabin. We're stuck here until sundown
32629,Stefan, How do you know that?
32630,Tessa, Because I taught him the damn spell
32631,Caroline," I don't want to know if Tyler called, so don't even tell me.Do you want to do small appliances or toiletries?I'd compel a cute boy to pack for us, but I don't think I want to see a cute boy ever again except for Jesse, who is conveniently not answering his phone"
32632,Katherine," Um, we're moving out?"
32633,Caroline," Hello! Dr. Maxfield thinks we're vampires, you know, threatened to expose us, told us to drop out"
32634,Katherine, That sucks. Ahem
32635,Caroline," What the hell are you doing in my dorm, Katherine?"
32636,Katherine, I just need a place to crash
32637,Caroline, What? I loathe you
32638,Katherine," I'm desperate, ok? Damon kicked me out, Stefan doesn't remember me, and I just spent my last $20 on a meal that I didn't even get to enjoy"
32639,Caroline, Aw. And how is any of this my problem?
32640,Katherine," Look at you. Moving out, giving up? That's very un-Caroline of you. You need me bad. In exchange for a place to stay and Elena's meal card, I will help you deal with Dr. whoever"
32641,Caroline, Dr. Maxfield. He teaches Bio
32642,Katherine," Heh. I'm sorry. What? You're scared of a teacher? Aw, honey, you really need to take a crash course on Villain 101, but luckily for you, I have an honorary doctorate. What do you say, roomie?"
32643,Tessa, Stefan's phone
32644,Elena, Who's this?
32645,Tessa," Uncanny. Your doppelganger voice is exactly like Amara's, so whiny"
32646,Elena," Tessa, where's Stefan?"
32647,Tessa," He's here. Well, not here, here. He hopped in the shower. Between us girls, he works up quite the sweat, but I guess you know that. May I leave him a message?"
32648,Elena, Yeah. Remind him that you're a crazy bitch
32649,Tessa," I would, but I think that's maybe his type"
32650,Elena, He's with Tessa. Why does he keep going back to her?
32651,Damon, Look. Who knows? Amnesia Stef's a fickle little fellow
32652,Silas, Wait. You didn't tell Elena what we you did to Stefan?
32653,Elena, Tell me what?
32654,Damon," Well, Silas needed his psychic juju to get into Tessa's head, and the only way to temporarily reactivate his ability was to break Stefan's neck a couple times"
32655,Elena," As if he didn't hate us enough.Damon, oh, God. I'm going over there"
32656,Silas, She should really. Tessa's bad business
32657,Damon," No. Just let Stefan have his space. It's like you said, he's already mad enough"
32658,Elena, Sounds like he's more mad at you. Maybe he and I can find some common ground
32659,Silas," Knock, knock. Knock, knock. Who's there? The Mayor. The Mayor who?"
32660,Damon," Well, who?"
32661,Silas, No one. That's the joke. No one's there because I k*ll the mayor
32662,Jeremy, You're a dick
32663,1., Subject 62547. bl*od film analysis. Cellular growth rate is phenomenal. As expected...
32664,1., What are you doing here?
32665,Tessa," Well, if it isn't Stefan's fated love"
32666,Elena, Where is he?
32667,Tessa, Come on in. Who am I to stand in the way of destiny?
32668,Stefan, Elena. You shouldn't have walked through that door
32669,Elena, I'm really sorry. I wouldn't have let Damon do what he did to you
32670,Stefan, Sure you would have. You have this annoying tendency to do anything he tells you to do
32671,Tessa," I'm no shrink, but I think it's called codependence"
32672,Elena," Look. I get that you're upset with us for pretty much everything, but do you really think that sleeping with Tessa is gonna solve anything?"
32673,Stefan, Who said I was sleeping with Tessa?
32674,Tessa," I am so bad with messages. Oh, look! Elena called. She's wondering why you're here. I may have embellished for effect"
32675,Elena," Ok. I just came by to make sure that she hadn't done some, like, ""Fatal Attraction"" spell on you, but now that I know that you're good, I'm gonna go"
32676,Stefan, Yeah. You really shouldn't have come inside
32677,Damon, Thank god
32678,Silas," How do you it, Damon? How you can stand being here while your girlfriend sits at home worrying about her doppelganger soul mate?"
32679,Damon, It's called being secure. I'm assuming you know a little bit about that by the way you wear your hair. Please don't tell me you believe in this doppelganger prophecy crap
32680,Silas, Crap? What do you mean crap? Do you not notice the universe trying to mirror my love for Amara by bringing our doppelgangers together?
32681,Damon," You do realize that by destroying the other side that you are personally moving heaven and earth to be together? That's not fate, you idiot.It's you being a crazy person"
32682,Jeremy, Ok. Where is this stupid anchor thing?
32683,Silas, I have no idea
32684,Damon, What do you mean you have no idea?
32685,Silas," Give me some credit, man. I did psychically dive into Tessa's mind to see this specific warehouse"
32686,Jeremy, What does it look like?
32687,Silas," Again, I have no idea. Tessa created it after she locked me away in a tomb for 2,000 years and left me to starve. Remember? Remote island, creepy hallucinations?"
32688,Damon, Wait. You don't know where it is or what it looks like?
32689,Silas, It binds a spell to a supernatural hell dimension. It's not gonna look like a freaking Ikea sink
32690,Caroline, What did you inject him with?
32691,Katherine, I don't know. It just said avoid contact with eyes and do not ingest. Oops
32692,1., That's atropine
32693,Katherine, There you go
32694,1.," What are you doing, Elena?"
32695,Caroline, We're draining the vervained bl*od out of your system so I can compel you to forget that Elena and I are vampires
32696,1., Wait. What? You'll k*ll me!
32697,Caroline, Shh. I'm just… I'm trying to do some math. Ok.So if the average male has 5 liters of bl*od in his system...
32698,Katherine, That's about right
32699,Caroline, Then carry the one. Just round up. Perfect! 4.7 pints. Should I use the right arm of the left arm?
32700,1., Untie me. I'll find the vein myself. You will k*ll me
32701,Katherine," Give me. It's not my first rodeo. Can you give me one of those tubing thingies and, um, some tape?"
32702,Caroline," Oh, my God. It's totally working"
32703,Katherine, Ta-da. So... Doctor... You tell me... Who else knows about us?
32704,1.," If you were willing to k*ll me, you wouldn't have gone through all this trouble.You should have left when I told you to. They're on to you"
32705,Caroline," Who's they? The people you want to expose us to, that secret society thingie that you belong to?"
32706,1., There's a gathering today at Whitmore house. The society's using it to suss out potential candidates. They were going to invite you until they started suspecting you were a vampire
32707,Katherine," So all I have to do is convince them that Elena Gilbert isn't a vampire? Done 1.: They'll never let you in, and a vampire can never get past the threshold"
32708,Bonnie, What did that crate do to you?
32709,Jeremy," Bonnie, what are you doing here?"
32710,Bonnie, Didn't want to miss the excitement. It's not every day a girl comes back from the dead
32711,Jeremy, Don't jinx it
32712,Bonnie," I'm not jinxing it. I'm being realistic. It's not a dime store spell, jer. When I brought you back, it k*ll me, remember? What I meant was it's just… it's not something I'm gonna count on, ok?"
32713,Jeremy," Not ok. Have some faith. If you believe that it can work and I believe it can work, then it will work. Just say it. You need to say it"
32714,Bonnie, It will work
32715,Jeremy, Thank you
32716,Bonnie," Jer, just so we're clear, I would die 100 times over just to have you standing here alive in front of me"
32717,Jeremy, Before today is over... We're gonna know what...that... feels like
32718,Silas, Quit dawdling. We have to find this thing before the Travelers show up
32719,Damon, Why are they so interested in this anchor?
32720,Silas," They hate me for creating the immortality spell, and they know The Anchor's the only thing standing in between me and my soul mate, and every love story needs that one thing that just keeps getting in the way. Kind of like you, Damon"
32721,Damon," You know, you might be an all-powerful witch… is that what you called it?"
32722,Silas, Yeah
32723,Damon, But I will happily k*ll you if you keep that up
32724,Silas," Oh, no, you won't, not until I bring your girlfriend's bestie back"
32725,Damon," Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise?"
32726,Tessa," You ain't seen nothing yet. Since I'm occupied at the moment, I need you to go ahead and k*ll Silas for me"
32727,Damon," Gladly, but he's such a control freak that he wants to off himself"
32728,Tessa," You mean, after he destroys the other side? Yeah. That's not gonna happen, plus I want him dead before he has the pleasure of finding The Anchor"
32729,Damon, Yeah. I'm not following
32730,Tessa, k*ll him now
32731,Elena, Damon
32732,Tessa, Did I mention I lured your girlfriend here to me. I used the oldest trick in the book… jealousy of Stefan! Thought you should know
32733,Stefan, Tessa!
32734,Damon, Stop. Stop it! I can't k*ll him yet. He has to do something for me first
32735,Tessa," Is that something more important than Elena? Because Silas put a spell on this house and bound it to the sun, which means we're trapped here until sundown, which means you have until then to k*ll Silas, or I k*ll Elena. With a face like Amara's, it might be cathartic Bye now"
32736,Damon, Whoa. Wait!
32737,Diane, Miss Gilbert
32738,Katherine, You know me?
32739,Diane, I'm Diane Freeman. We met the night your roommate died
32740,Katherine," Of course. Crazy night. Anyway, I am here for the shindig"
32741,Diane, I didn't realize you'd be joining us
32742,Katherine," Did I forget to RSVP? Oh, sorry. I've just been so busy with my studies"
32743,Diane, We just started the tea
32744,Katherine, Got any food?
32745,Katherine, What? Are you the sandwich police?
32746,Aaron, Just trying to figure out why Wes told me to stay away from you
32747,Katherine, Do I know you?
32748,Aaron, Aaron. We met yesterday. You changed your hair. It's...
32749,Katherine, Aaron. Duh. Hi. So what are you doing here? Are you part of... The secret society?
32750,Aaron, The what?
32751,Katherine, You know... The society
32752,Aaron, I still have no idea
32753,Katherine," Either you're genuinely clueless, or you're very good at keeping secrets"
32754,Aaron, Is that your tooth?
32755,Katherine, No. What is happening to me?
32756,Tessa, Look at all the incredible things they've dreamt up to do with food. Pineapple on pizza?
32757,Tessa, So sad. Let me guess. Gluten-free?
32758,Elena, How did you get here?
32759,Tessa, Excuse me?
32760,Elena," Here, alive, from the other side. How did you come back to life?"
32761,Tessa," Oh, yeah. That. You can blame your friend Bonnie for that. She opened the door and then distracted herself when she brought your little brother back to life, so I just walked right through when she died"
32762,Elena," Well, today, Silas was gonna bring her back to life after he got The Anchor, but you told my boyfriend, who has never put anyone's life before mine, including his own, to k*ll Silas before he could do that. So, no, I'm not sad about the pizza"
32763,Stefan, Look. Why don't we forget about the pizza? What do you say I make something?
32764,Tessa, Ok. Roasted duck
32765,Stefan, Wait. Do you have a duck?
32766,Tessa," No, but maybe I can lure one inside. Got Elena in. How much smarter could a duck be? Go for it"
32767,Stefan, Right
32768,Jeremy," We can't k*ll Silas. Silas is the only one that can bring Bonnie back, and he's not gonna bring her back until right before he destroys the other side"
32769,Damon," Yeah? Well, Tessa wants to do it now. Something tells me patience isn't her strong suit"
32770,Jeremy," Damon, you promised. You promised Elena that she would see Bonnie again"
32771,Damon," You don't think I'm aware of that? But if Tessa k*ll Elena, guess who's not gonna make it to Bonnie's welcome home party? Plan's off, Jeremy. Bonnie's not coming back. Sorry"
32772,Bonnie," It's ok, Jeremy"
32773,Jeremy, Bonnie… She's my sister
32774,Bonnie," Jeremy Gilbert, do you not know me at all? Is there a part of you that thinks for one minute that I'd let one of my friends die just so I could come back to life? I'm dead, jer, and as much as I want to come back maybe I'm just supposed to accept it"
32775,Jeremy, We were so close
32776,Bonnie, I know we were. Go help him k*ll Silas
32777,Damon, I've met a lot of witches in my day. Never quite heard that one before. Let me guess. Travelers
32778,Damon," Why do you witches always go for the daylight ring? I was about to do your little euro tribe a favor. I want to k*ll Silas, too"
32779,Traveler, That's the problem. We don't want him dead yet
32780,Damon," Well, that's not gonna work for me"
32781,1.," You're oddly calm, which only adds to my complete and utter terror"
32782,Caroline, Sorry. I spaced
32783,1.," You spaced? Caroline, I would have bled to death"
32784,Caroline, You know what? I just broke up with my boyfriend for good. My heart is in pieces. Sue me for having a moment
32785,1., My apologies. Is the moment over?
32786,Caroline," Yes, it is"
32787,Caroline, Now answer my questions truthfully. What is the secret society?
32788,1., It's called Augustine
32789,Caroline, Augustine? I've never heard of it
32790,1., That's the whole point
32791,Caroline, And how do you become a member?
32792,1.," Most recruits are legacies, but some of us were chosen for our extraordinary talents"
32793,Caroline, And what is your extraordinary talent?
32794,1., Being brilliant
32795,Caroline, Not to mention that you're willing to lie on autopsy reports like my roommate's. You knew that she was k*ll by a vampire. Is that why you covered up her death?
32796,1., No. I covered up her death because it wasn't just any vampire. It was the Augustine vampire
32797,Caroline, Hang on. Ok. So your creepy elitist society also has their own vampire? Who is it?
32798,Diane," Wes, you in there? It's Diane Freeman"
32799,Caroline, You were wrong. Elena Gilbert and I aren't vampires. We're just regular freshmen. You're light headed because you gave bl*od this morning. Forget everything that happened here
32800,Diane, Wes? So you are here
32801,1., Of course I'm here. Why?
32802,Diane, Because it's 5:00. You missed the Whitmore party
32803,1., What? I was working. The day must have gotten away from me
32804,Diane, That's not all you missed. Guess who I watched strut right through the front door. Elena Gilbert. Clearly not a vampire. What made you so convinced she was?
32805,1., I… have no idea. I guess I was wrong
32806,Stefan, Try this and let me know what you think
32807,Tessa, All right. Mmm. It's good
32808,Stefan, Yeah?
32809,Tessa, Yeah
32810,Elena," Ok. I get it. You hate me. You may not have any memories, Stefan, but I do. This person, she's not the type of person that you would like"
32811,Tessa," That's not very nice, especially considering I've allowed you to remain alive until sundown. Oh. Almost sundown"
32812,Stefan," Elena, don't say a word. I got this. I know you think that I hate you, but I don't. I won't let her hurt you, I promise"
32813,Tessa, Why isn't he picking up for…
32814,Damon, What?
32815,Tessa, Is he dead yet?
32816,Damon, There you are. Man up. We're under attack. No. He's not dead yet. I was just ambushed by some of your inbred cousins.Any idea why Travelers who hate Silas would want to stop me from k*ll him?
32817,Tessa, They probably want his bl*od
32818,Damon, For what?
32819,Tessa, Silas drank the cure from Katherine. Now his bl*od is the cure
32820,Damon," But they're not immortal, so who do they want it for?"
32821,Tessa," Think about it, Damon. The Travelers aren't fans of immortality, and I had to bind the other side to something, something that would last forever, something that Silas couldn't destroy"
32822,Damon," What, his favorite childhood sled?"
32823,Tessa," Something a little closer to his heart. 2,000 years old, immortal, indestructible. You're a quick boy, Damon.Figure it out"
32824,Stefan," Elena, run!"
32825,Damon, No way
32826,Jeremy, What?
32827,Damon, Not possible
32828,Jeremy, What?
32829,Damon," Tessa may be insane, but she's a bona fide genius. 2,000 years old, immortal, indestructible. The Anchor isn't a thing. It's a person"
32830,Silas, Amara
32831,Damon, She never k*ll Amara
32832,Silas, You're still alive. Amara… It's me
32833,Silas, You're ok
32834,Amara," Go away, go away. Go away. Leave me alone"
32835,Silas," No, no, no. It's ok. It's me, it's me"
32836,Amara, Silas
32837,Silas, It’s me
32838,Amara," Silas, how are you here? After all this time... How are you here?"
32839,Silas, I thought you were dead. Tessa said she k*ll you. She held your heart in her hands
32840,Amara, She lied. She shouldn’t k*ll me. There was only one cure. She wanted it for you
32841,Silas, I took it. I'm sorry. I wanted to be with you. I wanted to be at peace with you
32842,Amara, The cure runs in your veins
32843,Silas, I was ready to die for you
32844,Amara," I love you, Silas. I'm so sorry. I have to be cured. I can't live another day"
32845,1.,"Elena Gilbert, what brings you by?"
32846,1., How'd you get this?
32847,Katherine, Mystery. I listened to about half before I nearly blew my brains out from boredom except for the part about your subject's bl*od being abnormal. That part was mildly interesting
32848,1.," Well, thanks for returning it"
32849,Katherine," Now that subject, 62547, right, is that the Augustine vampire?"
32850,1., I think you should go
32851,Katherine," Heh. And do what, sprinkle all of your dirty little secrets across campus like Augustine and all the vampire experiments that you've been doing? Come on, Dr. Wes. Aren't you supposed to be some sort of genius?I'm sure we can come up with some creative solution for our little predicament"
32852,1.," I have to say if I wasn't such a genius, I might actually think you were blackmailing me, Elena"
32853,Katherine," Actually, my name's Katherine. Elena's my doppelganger, and while I let you chew on that... I'll admit there is something that I can't solve on my own"
32854,1., Is that a tooth?
32855,Katherine," It's my tooth. I think I'm dying, and I need you to save my life"
32856,Amara, Stop talking. It's not up to you. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Please leave me alone. Leave me alone
32857,Amara, Are you real?
32858,Damon, Are you?
32859,Stefan," Well, uh, have a good night"
32860,Elena," Yeah. It's weird. Even with no memory, you're...Still you"
32861,Stefan," Well, Tessa was gonna k*ll you, and you don't seem like you deserve that, so I was just going on instinct, that's all"
32862,Elena," Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Your instincts were always to protect me, so thank you for… for just being you"
32863,Stefan," Well, have a good night"
32864,Damon," Stefan Salvatore sleeps in his own bed tonight. Does that mean he stopped hating us, or did the power of the fated doppelganger universe push him into the car with you?"
32865,Elena," Well, he, uh, saved my life, so I'll take that as not hate"
32866,Damon, Victory in a day otherwise marred by failure
32867,Jeremy, We couldn't get Bonnie back. I get a pass
32868,Elena, Did I say anything?
32869,Bonnie," Tell her it's for the best, jer"
32870,Jeremy," No. No, I won't because it's not"
32871,Damon, what?
32872,Jeremy, Bonnie's here. She wants us not to worry
32873,Elena," We're gonna keep trying, Bonnie, ok? It's not over. We've dealt with much worse"
32874,Damon," Well, Silas is M.I.A. and out and about, which is pretty bad, and Amara's been cured, which is even worse because now she's easy to k*ll, so the fate of the other side, where Bonnie currently resides, rests on a living, breathing human being that we now need to protect"
32875,Elena, We need to protect?
32876,Damon," Elena, meet crazy pants. Crazy pants, meet Elena"
32877,Stefan, What are you doing here?
32878,Tessa, Do you have any idea what it's like watching history repeat itself?
32879,Stefan, You're hurt. I can heal you
32880,Tessa," No, no. I want this wound. It's a reminder of what you really are. See, memories are important. I made a mistake when I found you. I eased your pain. You used to have a lot of pain. Remember? You k*ll your own father... And then forced your brother to become a vampire. And that was just the start of your reign of terror. You hated yourself for a century, but then you found her. Didn't last very long, did it?"
32881,Stefan," Stop it. Stop it, please"
32882,Tessa," But the ending's the best part because you actually felt real pain, physical pain, torture. Remember? You were trapped in a safe and tossed in a quarry. Water flooded in. You tried to scream, you tried to escape, but all you could do was drown over and over and over again. The only thing keeping you sane was that one day one of the two people you loved... Would come rescue you, but they didn't. I did. Always remember that"
32883,Silas," You ever been in love? Love. Hello, you two"
32884,Woman," Yeah. We're together, in love"
32885,Silas," Aw, that's so adorable. I love love. I do. Yeah. I have a soul mate, too, you know, that love at first sight, want to live forever, love is eternal kind of love? Amara. That's her name.See, the problem is when I first met Amara, I was with another woman, so I kind of cheated on her, which to be honest with you, it really wouldn't have been that big of a deal except it turned out that the other woman was a raging lunatic, so when she found out that I cheated on her, she freaked out, turned Amara into stone, like, literally, Medusa style"
32886,Man," Dude, are you, like, ok?"
32887,Silas," What do you mean? You think I'm crazy? Why do you think I'm crazy?All I've wanted for the last 2,000 years. Is to be reunited with the love of my life. How's that crazy?"
32888,Woman, Maybe the turned her to stone part
32889,Man," Or the 2,000 years part"
32890,Silas," No. Guys, we were both immortal, and now we're not. Hello? Look. The point is I finally had the chance to hold Amara in my arms, and what does she do? She jams a chunk of glass into my carotid artery. Look, look"
32891,Man, No thanks
32892,Silas," Listen, you two. Here's my advice. Live it up. You know, enjoy this love while it lasts because let me tell you something. Just a couple days ago, I was psychic, I was immortal, I was in love. Now my neck hurts, my soul is crushed, I'm sitting in a bus stop in frigging Delaware"
32893,Woman, You're in Philly
32894,Silas," I'm in Philly? Ohh! God, it's even worse"
32895,Woman," What's going on, babe? Hey. What's going on? Hey. Talk to me. Oh, my God. What's happening? What are you doing to him?"
32896,Silas, I think I'm liquefying his internal organs. Did I fail to mention that I'm a witch?
32897,Woman, Please stop. Please just stop
32898,Silas," No! I'm pissed off at the world, and I'm taking it out on your so-called lover"
32899,Woman," Oh, my God!"
32900,Silas, And I'm thinking you might be my next v*ctim
32901,Woman," Oh, my God!"
32902,Silas," Look at that. Unbelievable. Love is so damn fickle. Incredible. Here you go, buddy. Come on up. Come on up, come on up, come on up. Up you go. That's good, good. Buses, however... Tried and true"
32903,Elena, Stefan. Morning. I made coffee. How did you sleep?
32904,Stefan, Ohh...not great
32905,Elena," First night back in your own bed. Not as comfy as Tessa's couch, huh?"
32906,Stefan," If we're gonna talk about Tessa, I think I need that caffeine. So, uh, what's with the wakeup call?"
32907,Elena," I miss you. I feel like when you lost your memories I lost a friend, and I was thinking instead of describing how much we meant to each other, maybe we can just start fresh. Hi. I'm Elena"
32908,Stefan, I was driving to Portland
32909,Elena, What?
32910,Stefan," The night I took Silas to the quarry, I said good-bye to Lexi, and then I decided to keep driving west"
32911,Elena, Wait. Hang on. How do you remember that?
32912,Stefan, Because my memories are back
32913,Elena, Really? Are you serious? How?
32914,Stefan," Tessa came here last night, and she undid whatever spell fried my brain, and it's all back. I can remember everything"
32915,Elena," Stefan, this is great! This is amazing"
32916,Damon, October 1852
32917,Stefan, You broke my nose trying to teach me how to throw a right hook
32918,Damon, But not on purpose just to be clear. How much did you pay for that hunk of junk motorcycle that you ride?
32919,Stefan," That's a trick question. You bought me that motorcycle, although I'm guessing it was pretty expensive"
32920,Damon," So Tessa just gave you back your memories, no strings attached"
32921,Stefan," Well, it wasn't exactly a gift. It was a lot to take in all at once, everything from blowing out the candles on my first birthday cake to... drowning in a safe"
32922,Elena, Stefan…
32923,Damon," Whoa! Easy there, buddy"
32924,Elena," Stefan, where did you go?"
32925,Stefan," Uh...all of that, and I still can't remember my own strength. What was that noise?"
32926,Damon," Uh, well that is…"
32927,Elena, We have a situation
32928,Damon, Of the doppelganger variety
32929,Elena, Yeah
32930,Stefan, Katherine?
32931,Damon," No, nope, not Katherine"
32932,Amara, I don't know! I don't know
32933,Stefan, What's wrong with her?
32934,Damon," Tessa turned her into a block of rock, left her in a box for 2,000 years, probably went a little stir crazy like those deserted island guys who talk to volleyballs"
32935,Amara, I said I don't know!
32936,Stefan, So you're telling me that this girl is the only thing holding together the other side?
32937,Damon, Yep. She's the anchor
32938,Amara, Leave me alone!
32939,Damon," As long as she's alive, the other side exists, and we can keep trying to get Bonnie from over there"
32940,Amara, I said I don't know!
32941,Stefan," Well, considering she's immortal, I'd say we have plenty of opportunity"
32942,Damon," You'd think, except last night she stuck a hole in Silas' neck, sucked the cure right out of him, so now she's not only nuts, but she's mortal, which means we have to keep her ordinary little human heart b*at until we get Bonnie back"
32943,Stefan, How would you plan to do that?
32944,Damon," Silas made a pinky promise that he'd do a spell to bring her back. Unfortunately, he's taking his sweet time coming back to Mystic Falls. Eh, Amara, stop!"
32945,Amara, No! No! Let me die. I want to die!
32946,Damon, Let's hope love is blind or at least deaf
32947,Jeremy, It turns out that it's not gonna be that easy to keep Amara alive
32948,Bonnie," I wonder what will happen if she dies and the other side gets destroyed. Think there will be, like, a white light and then nothing? It won't hurt, will it?Oh, it'd suck if it hurt"
32949,Jeremy," Bon, there's something I want to tell you. Actually, there are 3 things that I want to tell you"
32950,Bonnie, Don't you dare give me a good-bye speech
32951,Jeremy, This is not a good-bye. That's the first thing. I know one way or another that you will always be here. The second is thank you for giving your life up for me
32952,Bonnie, Jer…
32953,Jeremy, And the third is…
32954,Bonnie," Wait. Don't tell me. If you don't tell me, we'll have to wait until another time, which means there will be another time"
32955,Jeremy, I'm not sure it works like that
32956,Bonnie," Just go with it, ok?"
32957,Katherine," So what am I looking at here, hmm, bl*od clot, tumor, what?"
32958,1.," I did a full workup on your bl*od, Katherine. It's clean"
32959,Katherine," My hair is going gray, and my teeth are falling out. I'm not sure what that suggests, but it's definitely not health"
32960,1., Patient is irritable. Not sure if this is a symptom or personality
32961,Katherine, Personality. Now tell me exactly what the hell is going on with me
32962,1., You're aging
32963,Katherine, What?
32964,1.," You said you were turned into a vampire 500 years ago, give or take, and now that you're human, let's just say time is catching up with you"
32965,Katherine," Ok. Ok. Well, how do we stop it?"
32966,1., We don't. It's just life running its course quicker than normal
32967,Katherine, How much quicker?
32968,1.," If it continues at this rate, you have a few months. I'm sorry"
32969,Silas," Hello, Damon"
32970,Damon," Well, look who decided to pick up his phone. Is your secretary out sick?"
32971,Silas," They prefer administrative assistants now, thank you very much. I learned that on the bus. Very nice people on here by the way"
32972,Damon," You're taking a bus? Not to sound like a dick, man, but we're in a little bit of a rush over here"
32973,Silas," Yeah, but you know what's great about the bus? Open road, Damon. There's all this time to think, watch every day human beings in their normal environment. Did you know that gas is over $3.00 a gallon at the moment? That seems to really concern a lot of people"
32974,Damon, This is not a time to have an everyman crisis. We need you back here to resurrect Bonnie before your nutter butter soul mate offs herself an destroys the other side
32975,Silas, Yeah. I been thinking about that. Amara needs to die
32976,Damon, Pardon me?
32977,Silas," My poor Amara, all those years trapped in stone clearly left her unhinged, so look, if she doesn't want to spend another moment on this earth, then I'm more than happy to put her out of her misery and spend the rest of eternity in the afterlife with her, but listen, if you want to go ahead and k*ll her and save me the trouble, then please by all means"
32978,Damon," Not till you bring Bonnie back, remember? Promises made metaphorical hands shook"
32979,Silas," I've been thinking about that, too, Damon. Remember when I told you that the universe is working to draw our doppelgangers together and you laughed in my face? Well, if you don't bring Bonnie back from the other side, then you'll be breaking your promise to Elena, and the idea of jeopardizing your relationship brings me this perverse amount of joy, so I've decided not to help you, Damon, and I will see you soon. I'm looking forward to all this being over. Bye"
32980,Caroline," Hey, Jesse. You missed our study session again. Where are you? Look. I'm really worried. Just call me"
32981,Nadia, Well... that was pathetic
32982,Caroline," Um, I'm sorry?"
32983,Nadia, Leaving a message for a boy who… what's the American phrase… oh--is just not that into you?
32984,Caroline, And who are you?
32985,Nadia," I'm looking for Katherine Pierce. I heard she was living here, so I checked your room"
32986,Caroline, What? You went into my room?
32987,Nadia, Do you know where she is or not?
32988,Caroline, Great. Even Katherine's friends are bitches
32989,Nadia, I'm not her friend
32990,Katherine, Are you kidding me?
32991,Nadia, I need to speak with you
32992,Caroline," Um, how do you two know each other?"
32993,Nadia, Katherine is my…
32994,Katherine, She's my stylist. Ahem. She cuts my hair
32995,Caroline, Ok. Whatever
32996,Katherine, What do you want?
32997,Nadia, Sit. You've been avoiding me
32998,Katherine, Yeah. I've been a busy girl doing busy things
32999,Nadia, Sit
33000,Elena," We need to buy some more time, protect Amara. Maybe we should move her somewhere else"
33001,Damon," Silas is a witch. He's a living, breathing GPS tracking device. He'll track her wherever we take her"
33002,Elena, We can't let him anywhere near her until he brings Bonnie back
33003,Stefan, Weren't you listening to anything? He's not gonna bring her back
33004,Elena," So, what, I should just give up? Come on, Stefan. You got your memory back. You know me probably better than anyone else. Do you really think that I'm gonna give up?"
33005,Stefan, You know what? You're right. I do know you. You put your hope in all the wrong places. And sometimes in the wrong people. Silas needs to die and put us all out of our misery
33006,Elena," So long as he's alive, I'm holding out hope that he can still help us"
33007,Stefan," Well, as someone who just spent the last 3 months at the bottom of a quarry because of the guy, I wouldn't hold your breath, pun intended. Silas needs to die, and I need to be the one to k*ll him, end of story"
33008,Jeremy, How's our mental patient doing?
33009,Bonnie, I guess all those years alone sent her over the edge
33010,Jeremy, Relax. I'm… I'm just bringing dinner
33011,Amara, I know you
33012,Jeremy, I don't think so
33013,Amara," You're the hunter. I never forget a face, but Silas k*ll you. You're dead"
33014,Jeremy, I was. I came back
33015,Amara, How? I said how?
33016,Amara," It was you, wasn't it? You're a witch. You brought him back"
33017,Bonnie, You can see me?
33018,Amara, Of course I can see you. I'm not blind. I have eyes. Or are you dead? I get so mixed up. I can't tell the difference between the living or the dead
33019,Jeremy, Can you see people on the other side?
33020,Amara, I am the anchor to the other side. I can see everything
33021,Amara, Gah! Don't touch me! Please don't… don't touch me
33022,Bonnie, I can touch her
33023,Jeremy, Ok. That's weird
33024,Bonnie," Jer, I think I’ve got an idea"
33025,Jeremy," Amara could see Bonnie, and Bonnie could touch her. They made physical contact. It's like Amara's got foot on each side or something"
33026,Elena," Amara exists in both places at once, here and the other side?"
33027,Damon, Then she's not crazy crazy; she's just talking to dead supernatural beings roaming around in our basement
33028,Bonnie, That's not the point
33029,Jeremy, The point is if Silas isn't gonna help us what if Bonnie could be the same thing? What if she existed on both sides at once? What if she became the anchor?
33030,Elena," You're right. Jeremy, you're right. So all we would need is someone who could do that spell"
33031,Damon," Oh, please don't say who I think you're gonna say"
33032,Elena," Think about it. Silas wants Amara to die, and Amara wants Amara to die, so who besides us is the one person with the biggest stake against letting that happen?"
33033,Damon, I was hoping we could talk
33034,Tessa, And I was hoping you were my Chinese food. Good-bye
33035,Damon," You remember Amara, right, brunette, brown eyes; I'm surprisingly not in love with her?"
33036,Tessa, What about her?
33037,Damon," Well, she took the cure, she wants to die, and we have her"
33038,Tessa, But she's alive?
33039,Damon," For now. Silas is literally on his way to k*ll her. He's completely obsessed with destroying the other side so that he and Amara can live happily ever after in the great beyond. Man, you were right about these doppelgangers. They do always end up together. So how does it feel to say, ""I told you so""?"
33040,Tessa, Like I want to sh**t fireballs at Silas and drown him in acid
33041,Damon, See? That's what I thought. So how would you feel about us making a deal?
33042,Elena, Haven't you heard it's bad luck to k*ll your doppelganger?
33043,Stefan," Yeah? Well, if I don't k*ll him, he wins"
33044,Elena," And what if he k*ll you first? Witches aren't exactly easy to take down. We just got you back, Stefan. Don't do anything crazy. You and I have been down the revenge road, and it's not worth it"
33045,Stefan," You know, there were these moments in that safe, a stillness in time when I was dead right before I was about to come back to life, I would think about things in the past that made me happy, things that gave me hope. All these things kept me sane. They pushed me to hang on when all I wanted to do was give up and turn off my humanity, but eventually, the pain took those moments away from me, too"
33046,Elena, I'm so sorry
33047,Stefan," Every time I close my eyes, I can see Silas stabbing me, I can feel myself drowning, and I need to make it stop. If I don't k*ll him, I'm gonna lose my mind, or I'm gonna turn off my humanity... or both"
33048,Damon," So here's my pitch. In order to keep the other side in place, you need something to anchor the spell, right, something powerful, like an immortal being powerful. Now Amara was obviously a great choice until she downed the cure, so would you consider someone who's dead but stuck on the other side a viable candidate?"
33049,Tessa, An anchor swap?
33050,Damon, Because I've got a volunteer
33051,Tessa," I'd be making a ghost a human toll booth between our side and the other side, giving her the power to interact with our physical world and the supernatural Purgatory"
33052,Damon, So what's the problem?
33053,Tessa, I need a massive amount of power to do a transfer spell like that
33054,Damon, Fine. Name your poison
33055,Tessa," I need something to draw on. The moon's not full, I don't think there's a worthy comet for another couple billion years"
33056,Damon, Think hard. I have a girlfriend at home who misses her best friend and a wacky stowaway on su1c1de watch. It's ridiculous
33057,Tessa," Doppelgangers. They're powerful, mystical, naturally recurring"
33058,Damon, You want doppelganger bl*od? I got doppelgangers coming out of my ears. How many do you want?
33059,Nadia, You hate junk food. You call it toxic poison
33060,Katherine," Yeah? Well, I've decided to live a little. Now may I be excused, scary vampire daughter?"
33061,Nadia, You've been avoiding me. I don't like it
33062,Katherine, Clearly
33063,Nadia," We had a moment, you and I. There was a bond. I felt it, and then nothing.You abandoned me all over again"
33064,Katherine," Ok. First of all, I never abandoned you. You were snatched out of my arms at birth because my father thought I was a knocked-up, shameful slut, and second of all, it's been 500 years. Do we really have to do this whole mother-daughter bonding thing? Estrangement is so much easier, don't think?"
33065,Caroline," Sorry to interrupt the world's weirdest lunch, but, you with the doppelganger bl*od, duty calls"
33066,Katherine," Wonderful. Now that Katherine's a human and fragile, everyone thinks that they can just boss her around. Hands off, ok? I'm going"
33067,Nadia, We're not done
33068,Katherine," Oh, yes, we are"
33069,Tessa, So you live in this giant mansion with two doppelgangers that are destined to end up together?I swear there's a sitcom in there somewhere. So where's the ancient boyfriend-stealing bitch?
33070,Damon, This way
33071,Tessa, That'll be all
33072,Tessa," Well, if it isn't the face that launched a thousand doppelgangers. A little birdie told me you aren't enjoying your immortal life. 2,000 years, you have nothing to say to me? No apology?"
33073,Amara, I'm sorry
33074,Tessa, What was that?
33075,Amara," I'm sorry. That is what you want to hear, isn't it, how I have suffered, how every moment of my life has been a living a hell? It has!My sin was falling in love, and I've learned my lesson. You win. You win. Now please k*ll me. Please. Please k*ll me!"
33076,Tessa," Don't worry.When I make someone else the anchor, I will, and since you're nothing more than a non-supernatural human, you'll pass on while Silas is trapped on the other side, and then you and Silas, you're gonna spend eternity apart... And that is gonna be kind of fantastic for me. Selfishly speaking"
33077,Katherine, The cute one's here
33078,Caroline, She's all yours
33079,Tessa, Let me guess. You must be... Who now?
33080,Katherine, Let's be clear. I don't care about Bonnie Bennett or the other side going away or Elena getting her best friend back
33081,Tessa, You want something? I'm shocked
33082,Katherine," I had the cure you created running through my veins, and when Silas sucked it out of me, I started aging faster than normal. So basically, I'm dying, and I need you to fix me. You made the cure. Now make something that stops the aging. Otherwise, no bl*od for you"
33083,Tessa," Fine. When the ritual's finished and Bonnie is the anchor, we'll find a way to stop you from dying"
33084,Katherine, Thank you
33085,Tessa, Now where's tweedledee and tweedledum?
33086,Amara, What is that?
33087,Elena, It's Bonnie's grimoire
33088,Amara, A grim… what?
33089,Katherine, It's a magic spell book. Idiot
33090,Tessa," It's a talisman. Since Bonnie can't be here, her grimoire will have to do.Hands in, palms up"
33091,Tessa," Sorry, love. Did that hurt?"
33092,Amara, I've been through worse
33093,Katherine," Easy, ok? I'm fragile these days"
33094,Katherine, Showoff
33095,Tessa, No
33096,Katherine, Is it done?
33097,Tessa," No, it's not done"
33098,Elena, What's happening?
33099,Tessa," Silas is happening. Show yourself, bastard!"
33100,Katherine, I can't see anything. Can you?
33101,Damon, Electricity's out in the whole house. What happened?
33102,Elena, Silas is here
33103,Damon," Well, Silas owes me a fuse box. Hang on. I only count two doppelgangers. Where's crazy pants? And where's the other crazy?"
33104,Tessa," That was quite the show, Silas"
33105,Silas," Thank you. You haven't seen the love of my life running around here by any chance, have you?"
33106,Tessa," Nope. Maybe you shouldn't have turned the lights off, genius"
33107,Silas," You've had 2,000 years to watch us suffer. You've had your fun. Why can't you just let it go?"
33108,Tessa, Maybe I'm just not wired that way
33109,Silas," Honestly, I feel sorry for you. Hateful vengeance is for people without real love. You spent 2,000 years waiting for me to die just so you could be with me when all along the universe knew I belonged to somebody else. Doesn't that make your whole existence, like, I don't know, a total waste?"
33110,Tessa, I loved you
33111,Silas," Yeah? Well, get in line"
33112,Silas," Sucky timing, Stefan"
33113,Stefan, I disagree. I have Amara just beyond the property line.You have 10 minutes to come find us
33114,Silas," Well, I'm a little busy right now watching my nemesis bite it. Plus I have no interest in saving Amara's life"
33115,Stefan," I know that, which is why I'm gonna take her away, and I'm gonna keep her alive by any means possible while everyone else hunts you down like an animal. You now have 9 minutes"
33116,Caroline, Katherine? What are you doing?
33117,Katherine, Tessa's stupid nonsurgical incision won't stop bleeding
33118,Caroline, Here. Heal. What's wrong?
33119,Katherine, Nothing. Just another tragic side effect from taking that cure. Apparently the universe just doesn't want me to heal from vampire bl*od. Stupid universe. Find me that damn witch so she can finish that spell!
33120,Elena, No way
33121,Tessa, Can't a witch rest in peace?
33122,Elena, It's a flesh wound. Get up. You're not done yet
33123,Silas, Amara
33124,Amara, I loved you. I still do... But I can't live any longer. Please understand
33125,Silas, I understand. I love you
33126,Amara," Silas, please. I'm ready"
33127,Stefan," Do you remember me? I remember you. Oh, I'm sorry. Is it hard to breathe? Is your throat closing? Did the fear of dying start to creep in yet?"
33128,Silas," I hear every emotion is heightened for a vampire. All those memories must be eating you alive right now, Stefan. What's it like to die? I've never done it. You must have done it, what, a thousand times over the summer?"
33129,Stefan, Stop it
33130,Silas," Stop? I spent 2,000 years alone in a tomb. You were locked up for, what, 3 months? Look at you. You're a mess. The safe was the easy part, wasn't it? Being forgotten about, that's the real torture, isn't it?"
33131,Amara, Silas! Aah!
33132,Damon, Stefan and Amara are not inside
33133,Elena, That's because Stefan took her. You have to go find him before he gets himself k*ll
33134,Damon, No. He's luring Silas away so he can finish this. It's typical Stefan. He'll be fine
33135,Elena," He's hurting. Damon, he's not thinking clearly. Ok. Silas may have been the one that put him in that safe, but we were supposed to get him out of it. Please go find him. We can't lose him again"
33136,Damon, Ok
33137,Amara, Our journey starts now
33138,Damon," No! Amara. No. Amara, Amara. Drink this. Drink. More. No, no, no. Ok. No. Hey. Stay with me. Look at me, look at me. Amara, Amara. Hey! Look at me"
33139,Amara," I've been in hell for 2,000 years"
33140,Damon," What's another 5 minutes, huh?"
33141,Amara, Let me die
33142,Damon, No! Amara! Come on. Please
33143,Bonnie, I came to say good-bye
33144,Jeremy, What are you talking about? Tessa's doing the spell
33145,Bonnie," Amara's dying, Jer"
33146,Jeremy, No. That's impossible. Damon…
33147,Bonnie, Stop. We don't have much time
33148,Damon," Amara, Amara! Please, Amara!"
33149,Bonnie, Tell me the third thing
33150,Jeremy, Bon
33151,Bonnie," Tell me, please"
33152,Jeremy, I love you
33153,Bonnie," I love you, too"
33154,Jeremy, I'm not ready to let you go
33155,Jeremy, I can feel you!
33156,Bonnie, I can feel you
33157,Elena, Bonnie?
33158,Caroline, Please tell me this is real
33159,Bonnie, You guys can see me?
33160,Jeremy," Bonnie, it worked"
33161,Bonnie, It worked!
33162,Elena, You’re here
33163,Bonnie, Thank you
33164,Caroline," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! And we can be roommates because we have an extra bed, and we can clear out half the closet!"
33165,Elena/Bonnie, Caroline!
33166,Caroline, I can't believe you're really here!
33167,Bonnie, I'm here. I'm back
33168,Bonnie, I miss this. I miss feeling warm. I never felt warm on the other side
33169,Jeremy, I miss this... Holding your hand. I'm never gonna let you go again
33170,Katherine, Ok. I'm ready. Let's do this
33171,Tessa, You. Right. You want me to stop the aging? I'd find a drug store cream
33172,Katherine," Hilarious, but see the thing is, I'm not getting any younger, so spell away"
33173,Tessa, Altering someone's lifespan is what started this whole mess in the first place. I've learned my lesson. I'm not saving your life
33174,Katherine, Excuse me?
33175,Tessa," I won. Amara's gone, and Silas is waiting for me on the other side"
33176,Katherine," No. No! Help. Help! Somebody, help her! She's dying! Don't die. I need you"
33177,Tessa, True love prevails... The universe be damned
33178,Tessa, You're the anchor now
33179,Bonnie, Tessa. Where did you just come from?
33180,Tessa," I'm dead. As I pass through you, you'll feel my death.You'll feel every death. Every supernatural being that passes over to the other side will pass through you. Sorry. That's gonna hurt like a bit bitch"
33181,Elena, So he's dead? It's over?
33182,Stefan," Yeah, it's over"
33183,Elena, Are you ok?
33184,Stefan, I'm fine
33185,Elena," Look at me and tell me that k*ll Silas worked, that you'll be ok now"
33186,Stefan, Why is this so important to you?
33187,Elena, Because I know how much he stole from you
33188,Stefan," Yeah, and he's dead"
33189,Elena," And because while you were suffering in that safe, grasping onto hope, fighting every second so that you wouldn't lose your humanity, I was happy. I got everything that I wanted, Stefan. I got to be in love, I got the summer of my dreams, I got Bonnie back. So I need to know that this worked. I need to know that it's gonna take away all of your suffering. I need to know that you're gonna be ok"
33190,Stefan," I wanted it to be you. When that safe finally opened and somebody found me, I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be both of you"
33191,Caroline, Um...now that Bonnie's back...
33192,Katherine, Your room's full. Got it. I'll just get my stuff
33193,Caroline, Thank you for what you did today
33194,Katherine," Enough. I k*ll you once, don't forget. We still hate each other, ok?"
33195,Caroline," Yes, you did, and, yes, we do"
33196,Katherine, Where the hell is my bag?
33197,Nadia, Already packed
33198,Katherine, You again
33199,Nadia," I'm leaving, Katherine. I'm heading back to Prague, and I'd really like it if you came with me. We can go to Bulgaria, retrace our lives"
33200,Katherine," I don't know what kind of twisted fantasy you have about us, but that's all it is, a fantasy. I would rather rip my own heart out than do more mother-daughter bonding with you, and I'm human now, so it wouldn't really be that easy. I don't want to know you"
33201,Caroline, Mother-daughter? She's your… Oh. Wow
33202,Katherine," I'm doing you a favor, Nadia, ok? I can't be there for you, so take a good look because you are never gonna see me again"
33203,Stefan, No. no. It's over. It's supposed to be over
33204,Dr. Maxfield, Preliminary report subject 62547. Subject has transformed from human to vampire in approximately 14 days. Indicators predict a positive response to first bag of undiluted Augustine bl*od
33205,Dr. Maxfield, Physical strength is an unforeseen side effect. Terminating transfusion. Activating emergency procedures
33206,Bonnie," Hi, mom! I know we haven't seen each other or talked in a while, so I wanted to make you a video update. Um, I finally finished my whirlwind summer tour, got a new do, and I'm in college at Whitmore, where grams taught. This is my dorm! It's huge, right? Look. It even has a fireplace! I mean, what dorm has a fireplace?"
33207,Bonnie," Oh, here they are! Hey, guys! Say hi to my mom!"
33208,Caroline/Elena, Hi!
33209,Bonnie," They're planning me a welcome party. Just... just something hokey. I miss you. Um, please come visit when... ha... When you get a chance. I'll, um, I'll talk to you soon. Mmm-wha. Bye"
33210,Elena," ""And by the way, mom, I'm not a witch anymore because I died and then came back from the other side.”"
33211,Caroline," ‘’""Yeah. I'm the supernatural anchor that connects our two worlds together, so..."""
33212,Elena," ""Technically, I'm a ghost that people can still see and touch, so..."""
33213,Bonnie, Ok. So I left out a detail... or two. I'll explain when she visits. How big is this party going to be?
33214,Elena," Well, let's see. Silas and Tessa are gone, and you finally aren't"
33215,Caroline, Which equals massive cause for celebration!
33216,Elena," Which equals a massive party. Hopefully, since each of us have only made one friend in college so far"
33217,Caroline," And given that mine went radio silent after he kissed me, and yours was last seen at a tea party for a vampire-hating secret society…"
33218,Bonnie," Hmm. Augustine, right? The one who covered up your roommate's death and wants to kick you off campus? What? I've kept up! The other side is boring. What else am I supposed to do?"
33219,Elena," All right. So Augustine wants us gone. Who cares? It doesn't matter. It's not gonna happen. We're moving on with our lives together as functional vampires, former witch anchor thing, I don’t know. And we're having a party"
33220,Caroline, With jell-o shots!
33221,Bonnie," Oh, sh**t! Um, I have to go register for classes. What?"
33222,Caroline/Elena, Nothing
33223,Elena, Have fun registering
33224,Bonnie," Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
33225,Jeremy, Wait. Registering for classes?
33226,Bonnie, I know. I... she's... I know I have Elena's blessing. I still don't need to rub it in her face day one in the triple dorm room
33227,Jeremy, We could always sneak back to my place
33228,Bonnie," You mean, Damon's house? While we're at it, why don't we just have sex in his bathtub, or maybe Katherine could watch"
33229,Jeremy," This hair, by the way, kind of hot. You ok?"
33230,Bonnie, Yep. I got to go to class. See you tonight?
33231,Jeremy, Yeah ok
33232,The Lady, I'm ready
33233,Elena," I know this is gonna sound lame, but..."
33234,Damon," Any time you start with ""this is gonna sound lame,"" guess what... it is"
33235,Elena," This is for Bonnie,and you had a really big part in bringing her back, so I think that you should come"
33236,Elena," Oh! Wait. Hang on. Wait. Hey! Hey, Aaron. Hi. Long time, no see. Here. You're coming"
33237,Damon, Who's Aaron?
33238,Elena, Party in a dorm
33239,Aaron," No, thanks"
33240,Elena," I know what you're doing. You like to push people away, but the thing is..."
33241,Aaron, How do you know that about me?
33242,Elena, Because you told me at the costume ball when I compelled it out of you
33243,Elena," Ok. Forget that I said that, forget that I know anything. We're starting over. You're coming to my party. There will be free beer, and it will be really good for you. See you then"
33244,Aaron, See you tonight
33245,Damon," Well, that was an embarrassingly close call. Maybe I should be there so you don't spill all of our secrets and make out with the moody mystery guy"
33246,Elena," The only moody mystery guy that I want to make out with is you. Oh, and speaking of which, invite Stefan"
33247,Damon," Speaking of moody or making out? Either way, he'll never show. His memory's back, and he remembers he hates us"
33248,Elena," Just try, ok? I bought Bourbon, so he could just get drunk and hate us from afar"
33249,Damon," Well, I'll be sure to relay the message"
33250,Damon," So apparently we've been invited to a college party. Yeah. That was my first reaction, too. Then Elena promised a bottomless well of top-shelf alcohol. Stefan? You... ok?"
33251,Stefan," Yeah, I'm fine"
33252,Damon, How about my favorite reading chair?
33253,Stefan," Just tell Elena thanks, but I'm not really up for a party tonight"
33254,Katherine," How about now? Matty blue-blue, I want another drink"
33255,Matt, No! You're drunk and scaring the customers
33256,Katherine," You realize that every single time you say no it just makes you hotter, right?What are you watching, some Czech reality show?"
33257,Matt, How'd you know it was Czech?
33258,Katherine, Eye contact. We're getting started
33259,Matt," You translate, you drink"
33260,Katherine, Ok. What the hell am I looking at here?
33261,Matt," So over the summer, I went to Prague, met a girl. She followed me back here. And then her boyfriend put some spirit thing in my head"
33262,Katherine," Oh, dear. This is bad"
33263,Matt, Why?
33264,Katherine," Some guy named Kristof, he, um... He activated you"
33265,Matt, What do you mean activated me?
33266,Katherine, He's a traveler. Travelers are a faction of witches. They're big on spirit possession. You've got one inside of you.It's kind of like a human parasite that's hitching a ride in your brain
33267,Matt, So how the hell do I get it out of me?
33268,Katherine," That girl, the one that followed you back from Prague, was she, um, I don't know, feisty, a little accent, ridiculously beautiful?"
33269,Matt," Pretty much, yeah. Her name was Nadia. Why? Do you know her?"
33270,Katherine, You could say that. Ahem
33271,Elena," I, uh handed out all the fliers. Oh, and, uh, Damon said that he's gonna try and bring Stefan"
33272,Caroline, Funny. That seemed to imply that Damon is actually coming
33273,Elena, Hmm. Maybe a call from a mysteriously hot biology T.A. will help
33274,Caroline," Well, look who rose from the dead"
33275,Jesse, I need your help
33276,Caroline," What happened, Jesse?"
33277,Jesse," Just come to my room, please"
33278,Caroline," Ok. I'm coming, but what's going on?"
33279,Jesse, It's a long story. My roommate's gonna be home
33280,Aaron," Jesse! Jess, you home?"
33281,Jesse," I'm sorry, man"
33282,Aaron," Oh, my God"
33283,Caroline, Who the hell turned you into a vampire?
33284,Jesse," It was torture. I was in some cell all day, and then at night, he'd take me out and do experiments on me"
33285,Caroline, What kind of experiments?
33286,Jesse, I don't know. He'd starve me and then inject me with some weird bl*od. What am I supposed to tell my parents? They left me all these messages. They're wondering where the hell I am
33287,Caroline, We're going to call them and tell them that you lost your phone but you're ok.Where is Wes now?
33288,Jesse," I locked him in his lab after I attacked him. Honestly, though, the escape was kind of a blur. I wasn't exactly in my right mind"
33289,Caroline," Well, you're new, and you're hungry"
33290,Elena, Not for long. I brought our stash. How are you doing?
33291,Jesse," ""Our"" stash? You're a vampire, too?"
33292,Elena, You say it like it's a bad thing. First rule of being a vampire is realizing how awesome you are!
33293,Elena, How's he doing?
33294,Caroline," He's all right. He's alive. Elena, wait. I was thinking that Jesse could do it. You're a vampire now. You may have hurt him, but you can also heal him with your bl*od"
33295,Jesse, Holy crap. That's insane
33296,Caroline, Want to teach him about compulsion?
33297,Katherine," Hey, stranger. Lookie what I stole"
33298,Stefan, Knock yourself out
33299,Katherine," Hey. Come on. Please just have one drink with me. Please. Stefan, I've had a bad... Year really, and it would be nice to have a friendly face"
33300,Stefan, One pity drink
33301,Katherine," See? The universe at work. I don't know if you knew this, but our doppelganger stars are fated to be together, so like it or not, you're gonna end up with somebody who looks like me, although the universe seems to have all of its eggs in the Elena basket, but at this point, I don't really blame it"
33302,Stefan, What is wrong with you?
33303,Katherine," Other than the joint pain, receding gums, and the fact that I have to pee every 5 minutes, I'm dandy, but, hey, enough about me. Why are you all by your lonesome?"
33304,Stefan, So I could avoid talking to anyone
33305,Katherine," Well, if you did want to talk to someone, I'm right here, and, uh, let's be honest, I'm wasted, so I'm not gonna remember"
33306,Stefan," Look. I thought that k*ll Silas would allow me to move on with my life, but I was wrong. I spent my summer locked in a safe. One minute, I think I'm fine, the next minute I feel like I'm dying all over again"
33307,Katherine," Oh. Classic PTSD. You survived a pretty traumatic event, and now you're back, and you've got nothing but free time to just relive that terrible experience in the safe. Well, allow me to give your life a purpose. Help me with one little favor"
33308,Stefan, Should have known this was gonna come around to you needing something from me
33309,Katherine," I'm just trying to help. What would I know about posttraumatic stress? I only had my newborn ripped from my arms by my judgmental father and then had to run 500 years after my entire family had been slaughtered by a psychopath, but, hey, that didn't have any lingering side effects"
33310,Stefan, All right. What do you need?
33311,Nadia, I thought you never wanted to see me again. Why'd you call me?
33312,Katherine," Stefan, I'd like you to meet Nadia Petrova, my daughter"
33313,Jesse," So your mom's like me, too?"
33314,Bonnie," Yeah. Long story. She's, um, surviving fine.You'll be great"
33315,Jesse, Your eyes keep scanning the room. You afraid I'm gonna go vampire postal on the fourth floor freshmen?
33316,Bonnie," No. I'm sorry. I'm just looking for my, um... I'm not sure what he is actually"
33317,Jesse, Boyfriend? Friend with benefits?
33318,Bonnie," He's my best friend's little brother, he's still in High School, and I... Think I'm madly in love with him"
33319,Elena, Have you been keeping an eye on Jesse?
33320,Caroline, Yep. I've been teaching him the art of sublimating vampire hunger via grain alcohol
33321,Elena, And I sent Damon to question Wes
33322,Caroline," You realize that Damon's going to k*ll Wes, right?"
33323,Elena, He's not going to k*ll him. He's getting information
33324,Caroline," You realize that you're wrong, right?"
33325,Elena, Ok. Look. I know that you're not crazy about Damon and I being together...
33326,Caroline," No, no, it's fine. I'm fine with you two being together as long as you can acknowledge the kind of person you are together with"
33327,Dr. Wes, What do you want?
33328,Damon," What I want is to be drinking copious quantities of booze and making out with my girlfriend, but unfortunately, I can't do that until I get a bunch of answers out of you"
33329,Dr. Wes, Careful with those
33330,Damon,"These? These right here? Why? I mean, we're on a college campus, right, full of students? I can't imagine an M.D. has a bunch of infectious diseases just lying around"
33331,Dr. Wes, M.D.-PH.D. I'm a researcher
33332,Damon," I've met a lot of people like you. Science over medicine, right? Let me guess. You use these in your little vampire lab rats, don't you? Not in the mood to talk? Fair enough. We're gonna play a little game where I inject you with whatever the hell necrotizing fasciitis is"
33333,Dr. Wes, It's a flesh-eating bacteria
33334,Damon," Gross. So I'm gonna do that, and I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions. If you answer me correctly, I'm gonna give you some of my delicious... Vampire bl*od, and we'll heal you right on up. If you don't answer me correctly, we're just gonna have to see how much flesh these little guys can eat"
33335,Stefan," Just out of morbid curiosity, which one of you is younger?"
33336,Katherine/Nadia, I am
33337,Stefan, Right
33338,Matt, Ok. So here's the kn*fe the traveler left behind with me. Now what are we doing in here?
33339,Katherine," Take a seat, Matt"
33340,Nadia, This is ridiculous
33341,Nadia, Veeet
33342,Stefan, What the hell was that?
33343,Katherine, She's calling on Matt's passenger
33344,Stefan," Easy, easy, easy"
33345,Katherine," Hello, Gregor. I'm Nadia's mother. It's a pleasure to finally meet you"
33346,Matt/Gregor, What do you want?
33347,Katherine," Here's the thing. Nadia's my only child, so naturally, I'm suspicious of anyone who wants to date her. Why don't you tell us the real reason why you're in Mystic Falls?"
33348,Matt/Gregor, To track and k*ll Silas
33349,Katherine, Oh. So it has absolutely nothing to do with this?
33350,Matt/Gregor, How did you get that?
33351,Stefan," I would much rather be getting drunk right now, so why don't you stop wasting our time and tell us what you're doing here?"
33352,Matt/Gregor," Fine. After Silas was dead, I was meant to k*ll her"
33353,Katherine, I didn't see that one coming
33354,Nadia, You were using me to get to her? Why? Why would you k*ll her?
33355,Matt/Gregor, That's what the travelers want. I don't question my orders
33356,Katherine," See why I don't want you dating my daughter?Because travelers are ruthless, manipulative hypocrites. I know because your grandfather was one"
33357,Stefan, What did you just do?
33358,Katherine," Give it a rest. Matt will be fine. Gregor on the other hand, not so much. I just expelled his spirits. There's a reason why he wanted this kn*fe so badly. It's the only thing that will truly k*ll a passenger"
33359,Damon, Turning a kid into a vampire so you can experiment on him? What is it about this place that turns people into mad scientists?
33360,Dr. Wes, Human trials are a vital part of modern medicine
33361,Damon," Yeah, but don't people usually volunteer or sign waivers, maybe get some dough for tuition"
33362,Dr. Wes, Sometimes you do what's necessary for the greater good
33363,Damon," I'm not the greatest guy in the world, but it sounds like some Mengele level crap that you're spouting out, so I got to ask... What is your greater good? Rabies. Sounds fun, doesn't it, and appropriate given the circumstance"
33364,Bonnie, Are you doing ok?
33365,Lady, Am I on the famous other side?
33366,Bonnie," You are. What, um... What got you here?"
33367,Lady, I died
33368,Bonnie," No. I mean, what were you?"
33369,Lady, A witch. What are you?
33370,Bonnie, The anchor to the other side. Every supernatural being who dies passes through me
33371,Lady, That doesn't seem like it'd be a lot of fun for you
33372,Bonnie, It's better than being dead. I'm so sorry. Such a stupid thing to say
33373,Lady," It's ok, honey. Dying wasn't fun, but then you felt my pain, so I guess you know that. I'm sorry, but you know what? The pain's gone now, and seeing a friendly face over here certainly doesn't hurt"
33374,Jeremy, Sorry! Pretty much had to wrestle Elena to get her to give me these. You ok?
33375,Bonnie, Yeah. I think I am
33376,Jeremy, Good. I'm gonna need you to come with me
33377,Bonnie, Where are we going?
33378,Jeremy, To register for classes
33379,Jesse, That feels amazing
33380,Caroline, That's one of the other fun side effects. Everything is heightened
33381,Jesse, So that feeling never goes away?
33382,Caroline, Nope
33383,Damon," Well, rabies was a bust. I guess I'll find something a little more immediate"
33384,Dr. Maxfield, I wanted to turn Jesse into a new kind of vampire
33385,Damon," Well, that's awfully ambitious of you"
33386,Dr. Maxfield, I am awfully smart
33387,Damon, Ebola. Why?
33388,Dr. Maxfield, Your kind is dangerous to humans. You're dangerous because we're your food source. I want to change that
33389,Caroline, What?
33390,Jesse," Last time I kissed you, you got all weird, and it was awkward, and..."
33391,Dr. Maxfield," If vampires don't need to feed on humans, they're no longer a threat"
33392,Damon, I'm not buying the good doctor bit
33393,Dr. Maxfield, Human bl*od will only satiate Jesse temporarily until he gets a taste of what he really craves
33394,Damon," Well, what exactly does he really crave?"
33395,Caroline, You bit me. Hey. You ok?
33396,Jesse, Yeah. I just got to get out of here
33397,Caroline, Jesse!
33398,Aaron, Ok. So this isn't the lamest party that I've ever been to
33399,Elena," Aaron, hey. You made it"
33400,Aaron, Barely. I think I fell asleep. I just woke up
33401,Elena," Weird. Well, this will make it better"
33402,Aaron, Oh. Now I know why Wes told me to stay away from you. Cheers. Mmm. You're trouble
33403,Elena," So, hey. How do you know Wes anyway?"
33404,Aaron, He's my legal guardian
33405,Elena, Really? What about your parents?
33406,Aaron," Uh, dead"
33407,Elena," Mine, too. Birth and adoptive"
33408,Aaron," Whoa. Dark. No offense, but usually, I'm the biggest freak in the room. So how'd it happen?"
33409,Elena," Uh, our car went over a bridge. I lived, they didn't. You?"
33410,Aaron," I was 6, and we went camping, and I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming. I went to check it out, and I saw bl*od everywhere. They had bite marks all over their neck"
33411,Elena, Bite marks?
33412,Aaron," Yeah. They said a bear got into the camp. So I shuffled around distant relatives for a while. Eventually, Wes took me in. So Wes is the closest thing to family I have left"
33413,Elena, Wow. I think both need another Jell-O sh*t. I'll be right back. I'm glad that you came
33414,Aaron," Yeah. Me, too"
33415,Caroline, Hey. Have you seen Jesse?
33416,Elena, No
33417,Caroline, Wait. Where are you going?
33418,Elena," To call Damon, to make sure that he doesn't k*ll Dr. Wes"
33419,Katherine, There you are
33420,Stefan, Get away from me
33421,Katherine," Stefan, you're ok. Relax"
33422,Stefan, I can't do that. Do you understand me?
33423,Katherine," You have two options, Stefan. You either deal with this now, or you run, but either way, it's gonna catch up to you. I can't breathe, Stefan. Tell me the name of the first person that you k*ll... Ahh... k*ll. Mmm. Name him"
33424,Stefan, Gius... Giuseppe Salvatore
33425,Katherine, And the next? Focus on the name
33426,Stefan, Thomas Fell
33427,Katherine," See? You're in control, on solid ground. You're not drowning. You're not dying.Name them"
33428,Stefan," Honoria Fell, Marianna Lockwood, Christopher Gilbert, Margaret Forbes"
33429,Katherine, See? I told you I knew what I was doing
33430,Stefan, Thank you
33431,Nadia, You're right. Gregor is dead. Happy now?
33432,Katherine," You deserve better, Nadia"
33433,Nadia, Rot in hell
33434,Elena, Jesse feeds on... Vampires?
33435,Damon," That's what Doogie said, and apparently once he starts, he can't stop"
33436,Elena," Hey. Um, the fact that he told you this means that he's still alive, right?"
33437,Damon, As of now
33438,Elena," Good. Please don't k*ll him, Damon. Damon, tell me that you won't k*ll him"
33439,Damon," Ok, ok, ok. I won't k*ll him. Bye"
33440,Damon," Problem is I know people like you a lot better than you realize. If I let you live, you're just gonna do it again. You're gonna turn another vampire, you're gonna do another experiment. The only way to really handle you is just to snuff you out. You're lucky I don't feel like burying a body"
33441,Jesse, What the hell did you do to me?
33442,Damon," Easy there, k*ll"
33443,Jesse, Wasn't bad enough that you locked me up and poked me full of needles?Now I want to feed on the girl I like?
33444,Wes," You feed on monsters, Jesse"
33445,Damon," In case Professor Forbes forgot to tell you in your training, sweetie, I'm a lot older than you, and that means I'm a lot stronger than you"
33446,Wes, Actually that's not 100% accurate
33447,Damon, What the hell did they do to you?
33448,Elena," Damon! Jesse, Jesse, let go. Jesse!"
33449,Damon," He's gonna tear my head off. Elena, please"
33450,Caroline," No! No! No, Jesse! Jesse, come here. Hold on. Hold on. Just stay with me, please. Jesse, just stay with me, please. No… What did you do?"
33451,Elena, He was gonna k*ll Damon
33452,Caroline, But we promised that we would help him
33453,Damon," She didn't have a choice, all right? Once he had the taste of vampire bl*od, there was nothing stopping him. Go ask Dr. Frankenstein. I'll go deal with him"
33454,Elena," Caroline, I'm so sorry. I..."
33455,Caroline," Yeah. Me, too. Because the Elena that I used to know would have given Jesse a chance"
33456,Katherine," Dear Nadia, sorry I had to k*ll your boyfriend, but it was the motherly thing to do. su1c1de, however, not very motherly of me. I ran from my enemies for 500 years, and then one day, I stopped. Now a new enemy wants me dead. Sure I could run from the travelers, but there's still one enemy that I can never escape, time. So call it pride or vanity, but after the life that I've led, I refuse to drift off into the sunset. Good-bye, Nadia "
33457,Stefan, What are you doing?
33458,Katherine," I told you either face your problems, or you run. I chose option 3"
33459,Stefan, And what problem has you jumping off of a clock tower?
33460,Katherine," I'm dying, Stefan. I'm dying of old age. I don't know the cure did something to speed up the entire mortifying process"
33461,Stefan, Yeah. You're Katherine Pierce. Suck it up
33462,Bonnie, I'll admit it. I miss magic
33463,Jeremy, Step away from the candles
33464,Bonnie," Oh, my God. I think Jesse's dead"
33465,Jeremy, What?
33466,Jesse, I'm not ready. I don't want this
33467,Jeremy," Bonnie, what's going on? Bonnie! What is it?"
33468,Bonnie," I'm the anchor to the other side, Jer. Every supernatural being that dies has to pass through me"
33469,Jeremy, How often does that happen?Why... why didn't you tell me?
33470,Bonnie," I'm back here, touching you. We knew there would be consequences. Just kiss me. Kiss me. You... and me... This, this is worth it. Any consequence is worth this"
33471,Caroline," 'I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said earlier. It was out of line. It just sucks, you know, ‘cause Jesse was one of the good ones"
33472,Elena," I know, and I wouldn't have k*ll him if I could have done something. He was dangerous. I need you to believe that. I need you to believe me when I tell you that Caroline"
33473,Caroline," I believe you, ok? I believe you want to celebrate the fact that we can go to school and function like regular freshmen. I get that. I want that, too, but, Elena, when are you gonna figure out that the outside world is not nearly as dangerous as the person you're inviting into your own bedroom?"
33474,Elena, Wow! Why don't you tell me how you really feel?
33475,Caroline," The day that I stop telling you is the day that we're no longer best friends, and... I hope that day never comes"
33476,Dr. Maxfield," If you're gonna do this, I'd much rather prefer a b*llet through the brain"
33477,Damon, Actually I'm gonna wait until I can compel all this out of your head. What the hell's that? Why does this say 12144?
33478,Dr. Maxfield, Why do you care?
33479,Damon, Because I was 21051
33480,Dr. Maxfield, 21051. Hang on. You were an Augustine vampire?
33481,Damon," Augustine. I haven't heard that name in decades. Vampire lab rats, coded subject names. I thought you guys shut down 60 years ago"
33482,Dr. Maxfield, You thought wrong
33483,Damon, You know how I said I wasn't gonna k*ll you? I lied
33484,Dr. Maxfield," Atomized vervain. When working with vampires, you can never be too careful. I'm sure Augustine will be thrilled to have you back"
33485,Damon, Hey. I'm looking for Joseph Salvatore
33486,Joseph, You found him
33487,Damon," Love what you've done with the place. You know, if this whole boarding house thing doesn't pan out, you can always turn it into a high-class brothel"
33488,Joseph," I'm glad you got my telegram. I haven't heard from Stefan yet, but I'm hoping he'll be here soon. When's the last time you two spoke?"
33489,Damon," Well, he doesn't call, he doesn't write. Of course, neither do I. In all fairness, I am the one that abandoned him on a train platform in the middle of World w*r II"
33490,Joseph," Well, there's always time to be a better man"
33491,Damon," Eh, not sure I got one of those in me"
33492,Joseph," Sorry about the vervain, Damon. The money was too good to pass up"
33493,Man, Now I won't have to pay him
33494,Damon, Who the hell are you?
33495,Man, I'll be your doctor from now on
33496,Damon, What are you doing to me?
33497,Man, Just a little vervain
33498,Damon, What the hell are you doing to me?
33499,Dr. Maxfield, Vervain to keep you calm
33500,Damon, Wes? Why am I here?
33501,Dr. Maxfield," I lost a test subject last night, and you're gonna replace him"
33502,Katherine," Dear diary, so here I am alive. Stefan saved me from k*ll myself. Now he's got me on su1c1de watch. He says it will be therapeutic for me to write down my feelings about the fact that I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it. Deep thoughts, mortal coil, blah, blah, blah"
33503,Katherine," Ugh. My hand's tired. What kind of sentimental idiot writes down everything they feel? Is what the prophecy meant when it said that all the doppelgangers were drawn together like magnets? Because if it is, I want my money back"
33504,Stefan, I'm just trying to make sure you don't slit your wrists
33505,Katherine," Well, this whole neurotic granny vibe doesn't exactly make me want to live. Do you really have nothing better to do than stand there all day and watch me write in cursive?"
33506,Stefan, I'm trying to make sure you don't k*ll yourself
33507,Katherine," And how are you going to do that, you know, since you're still having your little panic attacks?"
33508,Stefan, I'm fine
33509,Katherine," Yeah. Of course. You are the picture of mental health, Stefan, after being locked for 3 months in a safe at the bottom of a quarry"
33510,Stefan, I am dealing with it
33511,Katherine," I know. I mean, I heard you dealing with it earlier today in the library. It sounded like you freaked out and broke a chair, maybe even two. How are you supposed to help me stay alive if you can't even help yourself?"
33512,Stefan, So does this mean you want to live?
33513,Katherine, No. It means that I can't work with people who can't give me 100%. And so I may have called for backup
33514,Stefan, What are you doing here?
33515,Caroline," I'm your sober sponsor, and I heard that you needed help"
33516,Stefan, Really?
33517,Caroline, And I got my mom to drop off something for us to use. Don't worry. I sanitized it
33518,Elena," Aaron, hey"
33519,Aaron, Hey. So you heard?
33520,Elena, Heard what?
33521,Aaron, That Jesse's dead. He k*ll himself last night. Campus security came by to tell me
33522,Elena," Oh, my God. I'm so sorry"
33523,Aaron," What's up with this college? It's supposed to be different. I came here to start fresh, get away from all the crap in my past..."
33524,Elena," I get it. After everything you've been through, everything that you've lost, I would want to start over, too"
33525,Aaron, How do you hit the reset button?
33526,Elena," Me? I haven't reset anything. All my problems, they've followed me here. Come to think of it, I'm probably not the right person to be getting advice from"
33527,Aaron," So if you're not here about Jesse, uh, why are you here?"
33528,Elena," I don't want to bother you, especially right now"
33529,Aaron," My day's not gonna get any worse, so, uh, go ahead"
33530,Elena," Ok. Well, um, last night, you told me that Wes was your legal guardian"
33531,Aaron," Yeah. Since this past summer after my Aunt Sara died. You see what I'm talking about? Everyone around me ends up dead, and my sunny disposition makes me so many friends"
33532,Elena, I'm sorry
33533,Aaron, Go ahead
33534,Elena," Um, the thing is my boyfriend Damon went to talk to Wes last night, and no one's really seen or heard from either of them since, and that kind of worries me, you know?So I know how bad the timing is, but I just… I was hoping that maybe you could help me find Wes"
33535,Aaron, Yeah. Yeah. I think I know a place that we can look
33536,Damon," Just so you know, didn't end well for the last Augustine’s. You're inviting bad karma in by holding me here"
33537,Dr. Maxfield, Is that what you told Dr. Whitmore?
33538,Damon, Dr. Whitmore wasn't much for conversation
33539,Damon," As much as I would like a free checkup, you're gonna let me go"
33540,Dr. Whitmore, That's a good try. I'm wearing vervain
33541,Damon," You know, most people would buy me dinner first"
33542,Dr. Whitmore, This isn't a personal matter. It's for the advancement of science
33543,Damon, What the hell are you talking about?
33544,Dr. Whitmore," You're a vampire. Your bl*od heals others, your body heals itself. You'll regenerate parts of internal organs after I remove them"
33545,Damon," Listen. How I got this amazing body has nothing to do with science, so running--aah!"
33546,Dr. Whitmore, You talk too much
33547,Damon," So you Augustine freaks are still at it, eye exams and that sort of thing?"
33548,Dr. Maxfield, Jesse was proof that my research goes far beyond that. I trained him to crave vampire bl*od instead of human bl*od. Now I'm ready to take my research to the next level
33549,Aaron, Just doesn't make sense why Jesse would k*ll himself
33550,Elena, So you believe what campus security told you?
33551,Aaron," Why, do you know something else?"
33552,Elena, Don't you think it's weird that both of your friends committed su1c1de before the first semester was even over?
33553,Aaron," Yeah, of course I think it's weird. Jesse loved it here; he had a huge crush on your friend. Megan had all these plans for her life."
33554,Elena," Which is why none of this makes sense. Aaron, look. I found Megan's body the night that she died. She was m*rder, and Wes forged her death certificate"
33555,Aaron, You saw her death certificate?
33556,Elena, I did some digging. Wes is part of something much bigger than anyone even realizes
33557,Aaron, Let's find him first. I want to hear his side of the story
33558,Elena," Oh, um... You know, when you said that Wes was probably doing research, I didn't realize it would be here at Whitmore house"
33559,Aaron," Oh, yeah. This place is like a second home. What are you waiting for? Come in"
33560,Elena, So who owns this place?
33561,Aaron," Not to sound like a douche, but technically, I do. Yeah. It's part of the Whitmore trust that I inherited when my parents died. Yeah. Don't hold that against me. Usually when people find out that my name's Aaron Whitmore…"
33562,Elena," Hold on. Your last name's Whitmore? So you, like, own this school?"
33563,Aaron, That's what they think
33564,Elena, That's my dad
33565,Dr. Maxfield, Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors the Augustine’s ever had
33566,Aaron, What the hell?
33567,Dr. Maxfield, I'm glad he didn't live to see this
33568,Stefan, I spent 3 months drowning in this thing. What the hell were you thinking?
33569,Caroline, I was thinking it's time for you to deal with the source of your PTSD
33570,Stefan, And you're sure you're not just sublimating your feelings about what happened to Jesse last night?
33571,Caroline, Feelings? What feelings would I have about my best friend k*ll the guy I was crushing on?
33572,Stefan," He was out of control, and Elena did what she had to do"
33573,Caroline, No. Elena did what she thought she had to do just like she also thought that Damon was good boyfriend material. Now you see where I'm going with this?
33574,Stefan," Anyway, aren't you a drama major? What do you know about PTSD?"
33575,Caroline," Well, I know that you tried to deal with it your own way and you failed, so now... We're gonna try it my way"
33576,Aaron," You know that this is kidnapping, right?"
33577,Dr. Maxfield, That was more like a tranquilizer
33578,Aaron," What? Ok. Uh, what is going on here, Wes?"
33579,Dr. Maxfield, I had to make sure Megan's death didn't draw attention to my work
33580,Aaron," Oh, to your work, your work? You study infectious disease transmittal"
33581,Dr. Maxfield, I study vampires
33582,Aaron, What?
33583,Dr. Maxfield," They exist, Aaron, and Elena Gilbert is one of them. The syringe I used on her had vervain in it. Think of it as an anti-vampire drug. It's one of my safety measures"
33584,Aaron, Where did all this stuff come from?
33585,Dr. Maxfield," This work has been going on for generations in secret. Your family pioneered it. Your dad trained me in it, and after your father died, the Whitmore trust continued to fund my research"
33586,Aaron, Why didn't you ever tell me about this?
33587,Dr. Maxfield," You never needed to know before now. I meant to tell you this on your birthday. This is what your family fought for and believed in, Aaron. Consider it your legacy"
33588,Damon," Come on, Elena. Wake up"
33589,Elena, Damon? Are you…?
33590,Damon," I'm fine. Wes injected you with vervain. Maybe when it wears off, we'll be able to… un… break through these"
33591,Elena, What the hell is going on? Why are you here? Why am I here?
33592,Damon," Wes is carrying out the grand Augustine tradition, getting his kicks off vampire torture"
33593,Elena, Did he tell you that?
33594,Damon," He didn't have to. I've been here before. Someone in my family sold me out do the Augustine’s in 1953. Every day, this nut job Dr. Whitmore tortured us, cut into us, took pieces of our eyes out, pushed us to every limit he could imagine, and he had quite the imagination. Kept me in this very cell, and don't think I haven't appreciated the irony"
33595,Elena, How long were you here?
33596,Damon, 5 years give or take
33597,Elena," Damon, how did you not go crazy?"
33598,Damon," Believe it or not, I made a friend"
33599,Enzo," Welcome .Dr. Whitmore never gets tired of watching us vampires heal, but he gives us one glass of bl*od per day, just enough to keep us alive. Pick yourself up, soldier. My name's Enzo"
33600,Damon, He was a soldier in Europe during World w*r II
33601,Elena, How did he end up here?
33602,Damon," Dr. Whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital when he discovered Enzo was a vampire, so he drugged him, locked him in a coffin to ship him overseas. He'd been here for 10 years by the time I joined the party"
33603,Enzo, You're doing it wrong. You're living for the moment. You need to live for the future
33604,Damon, What future?
33605,Enzo," The one where you get your revenge. For instance, in my future, my revenge will start with k*ll Whitmore's dog and mailing it to his house postage due. Go on. Picture your revenge. Use your imagination"
33606,Damon, I can see it
33607,Elena," Damon... Wes knew my dad. They worked together. He said that my dad was an Augustine, too. I know that my dad was a vampire hunter, but he was also the town doctor. He was kind and gentle and loving. He wouldn't be part of a place that would cut your eyes out"
33608,Damon," People are full of surprises. Oh, hey. I am so, so sorry I got you caught up in this. Hey. Hey. Look at me. But I promise you I will get you out of here, ok? Ok? I'll get you out of here"
33609,Stefan, Caroline! Do you even know what you're doing?
33610,Caroline," Yes. Well, it's in my textbook. Let me find it"
33611,Katherine," Have you two ever, um--ahem--you know?"
33612,Caroline," No, I don't know"
33613,Katherine," Oh, come on. You know. Have you?"
33614,Caroline," Oh, my God! Katherine, seriously?"
33615,Katherine, That wasn't exactly a yes or a no
33616,Caroline, We are friends
33617,Katherine, Your loss. He's great in bed
33618,Caroline," Oh, God. I'm so not listening to this. Here. Ok, Stefan. Prolonged exposure therapy. ""In vivo exposure gradually introduces elements of prior trauma, e.g. physical objects comma circumstances of duress comma"""
33619,Katherine," Ok. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got it, got it, got it. Stop talking. The words that are coming out of your mouth are giving me a headache"
33620,Stefan, Caroline! Caroline!
33621,Caroline, I'm just trying to understand what I'm doing
33622,Katherine, Acting like a schoolteacher isn't going to make him feel any better
33623,Stefan, I can't breathe
33624,Katherine," Well, you are right about one thing. He needs to get over the root of his problem because right now the score is safe one, Stefan zero. So how do you help the guy who always comes to the rescue? Stefan's the hero. That's who he is at his core. He can't always come through for himself, but he can always come through for everyone else. I've got an idea"
33625,Elena," Damon, how did you survive all those years?"
33626,Damon, Enzo's friendship kept me alive. He gave me a reason to hang on to my humanity...
33627,Enzo," You much of sports fan, Damon?"
33628,Damon, Even when I thought I'd be a prisoner forever
33629,Enzo," No. Neither am I. Any other interests… fine wines, travel, cars? I'm partial to Jaguars myself, convertibles, the kind you take on a Sunday drive to impress a pretty girl. Ever done that?"
33630,Damon, Once or twice
33631,Enzo," Oh, come now. Got to be more than that"
33632,Damon, The girl I was trying to impress was more of a horse and carriage type girl
33633,Enzo," What, just one girl?"
33634,Damon, Never met another one like her
33635,Enzo," Well, fair enough"
33636,Damon, Unh. What about you? Any pretty girls?
33637,Enzo," Eh, too many to count. Actually, there was one. Her name was Maggie"
33638,Damon, Where'd you meet her?
33639,Enzo, Here of all places. She was working for Dr. Whitmore
33640,Damon, Charming?
33641,Enzo," Oh, she was very. She was kind to me. She used to sit here in the hallway taking notes while she observed me"
33642,Damon, That's how you fell for her?
33643,Enzo," Oh, she was also stunningly beautiful. You have to understand she… she wasn't part of the torture and the experiments. For the longest while, she didn't realize that Dr. Whitmore was doing more than just observing my behavior. I didn't have the heart to tell her. I was just so glad of her company, you know?"
33644,Damon, Yeah
33645,Enzo," When she finally realized what was going on here, she couldn't bear it. So she said she was sorry, and she left"
33646,Damon," Well...yo u know, never really would have worked anyway. You're a vampire, she's a human. The relationship would have been doomed from the beginning"
33647,Enzo," You need a more positive outlook, mate"
33648,Dr. Whitmore," Who's next? 21051, you seem to have more energy"
33649,Enzo, I take that as an insult. I'm far more energetic than my neighbor here. I can't believe you didn't notice
33650,Dr. Whitmore, Your turn then
33651,Damon, Why are you doing this to us?
33652,Dr. Whitmore," Because, 21051, I'm seeking at the smallest indivisible unit of your biological makeup, and once I can understand you from a cellular level, I can put you to use"
33653,Elena," Oh, my God, Damon.Ok. Stefan is gonna figure this out. When you don't come home and no one hears from me, he will… he will find us"
33654,Damon," Points for optimism, but unfortunately Stefan doesn't even know this place exists"
33655,Elena, But you were here for 5 years
33656,Damon," Yeah, and the first year, I thought he'd rescue me. He didn't. Once I escaped, there was no point in giving him more to feel guilty about, so I never told him what happened here. I never told any one"
33657,Elena," Yeah, but you did escape. How did you do it? "
33658,Damon," They let us out of the basement once a year. Every New Year's Eve, the Augustine people had a little cocktail party with a vampire buffet on the side. We were weak from vervain injections, half-starved from living on a glass of bl*od a day, chained up like animals. This little annual shindig is where Dr. Whitmore got to show all of his Augustine friends what he'd found in his research"
33659,Dr. Whitmore, Mrs. Fell has generously offered her hand for the purpose of this demonstration. Please observe
33660,Damon, He let his guests drink from us to demonstrate the healing power of vampire bl*od
33661,Dr. Whitmore," The dermal layer is completely healed, no nerve damage, no muscular damage. See for yourselves"
33662,Damon," But on the plus side, that's how Enzo came up with his plan"
33663,Enzo," Well, the thing about our daily ration of bl*od is that it's barely enough for one vampire to survive on, but if one vampire were to drink two rations every day for the next year, he'd be able to build up his strength so that by the time new year's Eve comes round again that one vampire will be ready to fight"
33664,Damon, Are you sure that will work?
33665,Enzo," I'm sure I can only try with your help. We've just got to choose between us. All right, Damon. We're gonna play scissor, paper, stone to decide"
33666,Damon, Paper covers rock
33667,Enzo, All right then. A win's a win. You'll lead the way. Here's my ration. Now we've got 364 days to get you ready for the party. Cheers
33668,Damon, Cheers
33669,Elena, So did it work?
33670,Damon, More or less
33671,Elena, How did you get out?
33672,Damon," It doesn't matter, Elena. I got strong, I got out. It wasn't pretty. All you need to know"
33673,Dr. Maxfield, Here. Another birthday present. This belonged to your great grandfather. It's a safety precaution for use in vampire research
33674,Aaron, It's Anna Ruby campground. That's where my parents died
33675,Dr. Maxfield, I know
33676,Aaron," It wasn't an animal attack, was it?"
33677,Dr. Maxfield," I found them, Aaron. I found you next to their bodies. As soon as I saw them, I knew that vampires had attacked them. That's why I continued your father's work, so this could never happen again. I hope you'll join me"
33678,Katherine, So try not to be mad at me. I got in here while you were unconscious. Then Caroline locked us inside. It was the only way
33679,Stefan, Let me out of here! Caroline!
33680,Caroline," I know it's a little extreme, but the baby steps approach wasn't working"
33681,Katherine," See? That's why I need you not to get mad at me because when you’re mad, you get anxious and violent and you rip people's heads off, but I'm gonna help you fix that"
33682,Stefan," Caroline, get me out of here before I hurt her!"
33683,Katherine," That's the whole point, Stefan. You need to get over your PTSD triggers, ok, or else you will k*ll me"
33684,Stefan, You're risking your life
33685,Katherine," I'm already dying, you idiot. You're the one who wants to keep me alive. It's my turn to help you now"
33686,Stefan, I can't be in here. Please
33687,Katherine, You're Stefan Salvatore. Suck it up
33688,Elena," Wes is gonna come back down here, and we'll both be the newest Augustine experiment. You have to tell me how you got out of here, Damon"
33689,Damon," You don't want to know, Elena"
33690,Elena," Why? You think that I'm gonna judge you? Damon, I love you. I love you, and these people tortured you for 5 years. Whatever you had to do, I don't care"
33691,Damon," All right. All right. The Augustine’s next party was in 1958. I'd been drinking Enzo's ration for an entire year. I mean, he kept a few drops here and there so he wouldn't desiccate, and as he starved himself, I got stronger from all the extra bl*od just like he said I would"
33692,Dr. Whitmore," Ladies and gentlemen, as it is almost midnight, I think it fitting that we toast the New Year with a glass of vampire bl*od, wouldn't you agree?"
33693,Damon, Now you see it...
33694,Enzo," Damon, we got to get out of here. Damon, now! Let's go!"
33695,Damon, Vervain!
33696,Enzo," Come on, come on. You can do it"
33697,Damon," Enzo trusted me with his life. The fire was getting out of control. I would have b*rned up, or they would have captured me again. There's no way I would have ever gotten another chance of escaping. So I chose to save myself"
33698,Enzo, Damon
33699,Damon," I'm sorry, Enzo"
33700,Enzo," Damon, please"
33701,Damon, And I knew if I was gonna save myself that I had to stop caring about Enzo. So I turned off my emotions
33702,Enzo, Don't… don't leave me here. Don't go! Please! Damon!
33703,Damon, I let my friend die
33704,Enzo, Please don't leave me! Damon! Come on! Damon! Damon!
33705,Damon," After that, everything was fine"
33706,Caroline, How's it going in there?
33707,Stefan, I… I can't breathe. I feel… I feel… I feel like I'm dying
33708,Katherine," So I've been using this time to think. I think there is actually a little bit of truth to this doppelganger prophecy. I think you're still in love with Elena. I think you're miserable about the fact that she chose Damon over you and that you want to get out of this one-horse town and as far away from their happiness as possible, and yet somehow, you keep finding excuses to stay in Mystic Falls. I think I'm just that latest excuse"
33709,Stefan, I'm gonna k*ll you
33710,Katherine," Good. Yeah. Get it all out, Stefan. I think this is healthy, although don't forget you loved me before you hated me"
33711,Stefan, Any reason you chose to have this conversation with me locked in a safe?
33712,Katherine, Yes! So that I can show you that the safe isn't the problem
33713,Stefan, How could you say that to me?
33714,Katherine," The problem is you're not facing your real issues. The death that you felt in the safe, the pain of dying over and over again, it's easier for you to focus on the physical pain than the emotional heartbreak of Elena leaving you. Your problem is you're not in touch with the reality of the moment, so let's bring you back to the present, shall we? In this moment, are you going to feed on me, or are you gonna save my life? Fight it, Stefan, fight it! I'm here. I'm here I'm with you. We're together"
33715,Caroline," It was so quiet, I got worried. See? You made it out alive"
33716,Aaron, What the hell is this place?
33717,Elena, Aaron?
33718,Damon, Great. Mini-Wes
33719,Aaron, I had no idea what Wes was doing. I didn't even know there was a basement down here
33720,Elena," Aaron, you have to help us"
33721,Aaron," I want to know the truth. When you met me at Megan's memorial, you asked me a bunch of questions"
33722,Damon," Slick hands, cowboy"
33723,Aaron," Yeah? Well, I've never used a g*n before, and I've never k*ll anyone either unlike you"
33724,Elena, What are you talking about?
33725,Aaron, Wes said a vampire k*ll Megan
33726,Damon, And you thought it was Elena?
33727,Elena, No. Megan was inside this house. I hadn't even been invited yet. You ju…
33728,Aaron," Wes also said that a vampire k*ll my parents. Maybe that was you, too"
33729,Elena," No. Aaron, that's impossible"
33730,Aaron, Why else would you be so interested in me?
33731,Damon, Calm down
33732,Aaron, Why else would you pretend to be my friend? She's a vampire!
33733,Damon, Not the one that k*ll your parents. It was all me
33734,Aaron, What did you just say? Start talking
33735,Elena," Damon, what are you doing?"
33736,Damon," In 1958, after the fire, Enzo was dead, so I had to take on my revenge plan solo"
33737,Damon," Yes. I can see it. After I've taken out the entire Augustine society, I'll k*ll every member of the Whitmore family"
33738,Enzo, Boo! I said use your imagination
33739,Damon," Except one person. I'll let that person grow up and start a family, and then I'll start k*ll Whitmore’s again. Then I'll take out the generation after that, leaving only one person to carry on the name, and then I'll take out the generation after that and so on and so on and so on"
33740,Damon, And that's exactly what I did
33741,Aaron, How many Whitmore’s have you k*ll?
33742,Damon, Since 1958? I lost count
33743,Elena," When was the last one? Damon, when was the last one?"
33744,Damon, A few months ago. Her name was Sara. I had to go all the way to Charleston to find her. It was a weekend trip. You didn't know
33745,Elena, But we were together a few months ago. Starting the summer of our lives. I had no idea
33746,Damon, Told you it wasn't pretty
33747,Caroline," A little help here! I mean, I know I'm a vampire, but this thing is really heavy. Stefan? Hello!"
33748,Stefan," You know, for the record, I, uh, I only broke one of these"
33749,Katherine, It was an ugly chair. You're better off without it
33750,Stefan, So I guess you were right all along. It was easier for me to focus on my physical pain than the breakup. I need to move on
33751,Katherine, So you admit it. I do know what I'm doing
33752,Stefan," To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine"
33753,Katherine," Well, Stefan, sometimes... I don't either. Like right now... For example"
33754,Caroline," Hey, Elena. I'm probably gonna stay at my mom's tonight. I think I am officially homesick, so I'll let you know when I'm... Oh, my God. Call me as soon as you get this!"
33755,Dr. Maxfield, Look. I'm sorry you had to find out about your parents like this
33756,Aaron," What the hell is going on, Wes? Their other friends gonna come after me? I mean, do I need to drop out?"
33757,Dr. Maxfield," You'll be fine. Just go to school, live your life.Talk to you soon"
33758,Damon, Ohh. Guess I had that coming. Elena? Elena? Elena? Elena! Elena!
33759,Elena, What's happening?
33760,Enzo, Welcome. I'm 12144. My name is Enzo
33761,Katherine," Oh, my God!"
33762,Stefan, Hmm. Hey
33763,Katherine," Um, don't turn around"
33764,Stefan, What are you doing?
33765,Katherine," Um, just don't turn around"
33766,Stefan, Where are you going?
33767,Katherine," Uh, everything's fine. Go back to bed"
33768,Katherine, What the hell happened to you?
33769,Damon," Ditto. Elena's not here by any chance, is she?"
33770,Katherine," I haven't seen her, not that I've been looking"
33771,Damon," Stef, you awake?"
33772,Katherine," You know, he hasn't seen her either. I know because we were together all night"
33773,Damon," Look. I've had a really crappy couple days, ok? If you're implying what I think you're implying…"
33774,Katherine," Why? What were you thinking? That our hot, naked bodies collided in one unforgettable night of passion?"
33775,Damon, I'm gonna barf
33776,Katherine, Great. Then my work here is done. Too-do-loo
33777,Dr. Maxfield, Subject 83182 appears conscious
33778,Elena, Where am I?
33779,Dr. Maxfield, Why? Look familiar?
33780,Elena, What is that thing? What are you doing to me?
33781,Dr. Maxfield," 83182 resume prep for bl*od dialysis. Count from 10 , 9, 8, 7, 6, 5..."
33782,Stefan, Where the hell you been?
33783,Damon," Aw, you know, being held against my will, sh*t in the head, now I can't find Elena. How was your evening? Anything out of the ordinary happen?"
33784,Stefan, Wait a minute. What do you mean you can't find Elena?
33785,Damon," I mean, she's not picking up her phone, she's not in her dorm, she's nowhere in this house, which leads me to believe that Dr. creepy Ken Doll has her somewhere"
33786,Stefan, Are you talking about the Whitmore bio teacher?
33787,Damon," Yeah, the one that operated on vampires during business hours, yeah, that one. Put your hero hair on, Stefan. Let's go get Elena"
33788,Stefan, You just said you don't know where she is
33789,Damon," I don't, which means we're gonna have to find us some leverage. So come on"
33790,Damon," Pop quiz. So your girlfriend's taken by a mad scientist. Now do you: ""A,"" get a new girlfriend; B,"" call the police; Or ""C,"" k*ll someone close to that mad scientist?"
33791,Maxfield, 4.1 pints drained. 83182 still shows signs of consciousness. Note that 15 years ago subject 12144 faded into unconsciousness after losing 2.9 pints. Evolution or luck? Mystery for another day
33792,Elena, What are you doing to me?What are these tubes? Let me go!
33793,Maxfield, Relax. I plan to once I'm through with you
33794,Elena, My friends are gonna find me
33795,Maxfield, Your heroic vampire friends? Did you know Aaron Whitmore spent his entire life thinking his family was haunted by some death curse? Turns out that curse was your boyfriend systematically k*ll every member on his family tree. I'm curious. How does one justify that in her mind?
33796,Elena," And this, holding people against their will, how do you justify that?"
33797,Maxfield, Science
33798,Maxfield," ""June 25, 1999. Incredible findings today. After enduring 3,000 volts of electricity, the subject continues to have a b*at. June 26. More success. Subject was exposed to 4,000 volts today. Seizing continues after electrocution. Flesh remains hot to the touch."""
33799,Elena, You're a monster
33800,Maxfield," This isn't my journal, Elena. These are the hand-written medical findings of Dr. Grayson Gilbert, your father"
33801,Elena, What?
33802,Maxfield," Everything I'm doing to you, I learned from him"
33803,Aaron, I have no idea where Wes took her
33804,Stefan," Well, they're not at his lab, so where else could he hide a vampire?"
33805,Aaron, I'm sorry. Am I supposed to know who you are?
33806,Damon," That's my brother Stefan, but I'd watch your tone with him because he's kind of in the midst of a psychotic break"
33807,Stefan, I'm sorry. I'm what?
33808,Damon," Oh, come on. You don't think I know about you and Katherine?"
33809,Stefan," Oh, I see. You're jealous"
33810,Damon," More like disturbed. See? He's off his rocker, he's losing his mind, teetering on the brink of insanity"
33811,Aaron, How are you not dead? I sh*t you
33812,Damon," Well, because you went for the head. You got to go for the heart. Go for the heart next time. Now where's Elena?"
33813,Aaron, I have no idea. All that Wes told me was to go about my life as usual
33814,Damon," Well, you're gonna call Wes, and you're gonna tell him that if he doesn't give us Elena the next experiment that he conducts will be sewing your arms back on"
33815,Elena, This is my dad's clinic. We're in the basement
33816,Wes, Was your dad's clinic. Then your town council b*rned a whole bunch of vampires down here. Now it's just a condemned building in Mystic Falls where no one will find us
33817,Wes," Aaron, hey"
33818,Aaron, Do you have Elena?
33819,Wes," Aaron, what's wrong?"
33820,Aaron," Uh, Stefan and Damon Salvatore are gonna k*ll me unless you give them Elena"
33821,Wes, Damon Salvatore is locked in an impenetrable and inescapable fortified cell
33822,Aaron, Or he's in front of me imagining what my kidney would taste like
33823,Wes," Fine. Meet you in my classroom. Once I see you're safe, tell them I'll give them Elena"
33824,Wes," Enzo… Enzo, wake up. When was the last time you were out in civilization?"
33825,Enzo, What's that?
33826,Wes, An insurance policy. Guarantees you'll come back to me. I'm giving you the day off. You and Damon have some catching up to do.
33827,Katherine, I don't hear you counting
33828,Matt," 3, 4, 5, 6"
33829,Katherine, Uh!
33830,Matt, Good try
33831,Katherine," Good try? That was horrible, Matt. Come on. I'm paying you to make me hot again, whip me into shape, and prolong this death thing as long as possible"
33832,Matt," Yeah, that will happen"
33833,Katherine," What did you say? No. Seriously. I didn't hear you. Oh, God. I'm going deaf. I'm going deaf. My entire body is falling apart. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Wa--water! Give me some water. Faster"
33834,Matt," Deep breaths. If you're so anxious not to be dead, why don't you just have a vampire turn you?"
33835,Katherine," Tried that. Every time I ingest vampire bl*od, my body rejects it"
33836,Katherine, Who is that? I can't see
33837,Matt, It's Nadia. I told her you were here
33838,Nadia," ""Dear Nadia, sorry I had to k*ll your boyfriend, but it was the motherly thing to do. su1c1de, however, not very motherly of me."""
33839,Katherine," Great. So, um, Stefan obviously gave you my su1c1de note. What's your point?"
33840,Nadia, That's for trying to k*ll yourself without saying good-bye
33841,Stefan, You want to give me a little back story as to how you know one another?
33842,Damon," Aaron is Aaron Whitmore, and he comes from a very long line of vampire-probing, blood-testing, organ-removing freaks called Augustine"
33843,Stefan, Why do you know this?
33844,Damon, Because I was their test subject in the fifties
33845,Stefan, What do you mean test subject?
33846,Damon, Meaning I donated my body to science except I was alive and it was against my will
33847,Stefan, Wait. Hold on a minute. How do I not know about this?
33848,Damon," Don't get all guilt-ridden, Stefan, on me. We were on the outs back then, and by the time it was over, you know, it was over"
33849,Aaron," Why don't you finish the rest of the story, Damon?"
33850,Stefan, I don't recall saying that you could talk. Did I say that he could talk?
33851,Damon, I don't remember anything
33852,Stefan, I didn't think so
33853,Nadia," I get it now. If I was living here, I'd want to k*ll myself, too"
33854,Katherine, It was a moment of weakness. I'm over it
33855,Nadia," In a moment of weakness, you eat chocolate or kiss the wrong boy. You don't jump off a clock tower"
33856,Katherine, Do you see this? This is raw kale. In what universe would I put this inside of my body unless I actually wanted to live another day
33857,Nadia, Ok. Then what changed your mind?
33858,Katherine, It's not so much a matter of what as it is who. Can I ask you something absentee mother to mildly abusive daughter?
33859,Nadia, I'm listening
33860,Katherine, Do you think after all the horrible things that I've done it would be possible to be forgiven?
33861,Nadia, Of course I do. That's actually why I'm here. I may have an idea that will keep you alive longer
33862,Katherine, I'm listening
33863,Elena, When did you meet my dad?
33864,Wes," He was working with Augustine to turn vampire bl*od into a magical cure-all to fight disease, cure cancer, save the world"
33865,Elena," Do you know if he ever brought a vampire down here?I remember coming down here as a kid. There was something about this place that always creeped me out. Wes, I saw Enzo when I woke up. I know he's alive. Where is he?"
33866,Wes, He's on a little day trip. Apparently he has some unresolved business with your boyfriend
33867,Elena, What did you do? What did you do? What did you do?
33868,Damon, Which one is it?
33869,Aaron, It's right here. 21051
33870,Damon, Enzo!
33871,Enzo," It's been a while, mate"
33872,Stefan, Who the hell are you?
33873,Enzo, Lorenzo... But my friends call me Enzo. Ah. Kidding. I don't have any friends
33874,Damon, Enzo's another Augustine vampire. Our cells were next to each other. So we're here to meet somebody-- Wes Maxfield. You know him?
33875,Enzo," That's your first question for me? Not ""how are you? How'd you survive in that fire I left you to die in""?"
33876,Aaron," Uh, does somebody want to tell me what the hell is going on here?"
33877,Enzo, I'd love to. Have a seat. Been waiting 70 years to tell my story
33878,Elena," Enzo is the Augustine vampire. He k*ll my roommate Megan, didn't he?"
33879,Wes, Conserve your energy. I've drained enough bl*od to start phase two
33880,Elena," Let me guess. You're not gonna tell me what phase two is, are you?"
33881,Wes," If it works, you'll be the first one to know"
33882,Elena, Why did Megan have a picture of my dad on her cell phone?
33883,Wes, Maybe because her parents helped fund your father's projects
33884,Elena," They knew about Augustine, too?"
33885,Wes," Well, no. All they knew was that your dad had an unregulated compound that could cure most injuries"
33886,Elena, Vampire bl*od
33887,Wes," Exactly, but as Megan grew up, she got suspicious, enrolled at Whitmore, roomed with Dr. Gilbert's daughter, and she went to a party at Whitmore house and put her nose where it didn't belong"
33888,Elena, She found Enzo in his cell
33889,Wes," And being clueless to what a starving vampire will do around fresh human bl*od, I'm guessing she got too close"
33890,Wes, Aaron
33891,Stefan, Where's Elena?
33892,Wes, Who's this?
33893,Stefan," We have Aaron, and we're trying to decide how to k*ll him"
33894,Wes," Funny. I have Elena, and I'm wondering how she'll function without her cerebral cortex. Touch him, and you'll never see her again"
33895,Stefan, That threat works both ways
33896,Enzo," Damon and I had been locked in those cells for years, tortured, b*at, humiliated, but we weren't gonna let them break us, no. We decided if we were going to escape we needed to work together. We needed each other"
33897,Stefan, He's not sending her
33898,Enzo," Tragic. Can I continue my story now, please?"
33899,Damon, Doesn't he know we have Aaron?
33900,Stefan, He doesn't care. He's willing to risk it
33901,Aaron, What? Let me talk to him! He'll listen to me
33902,Damon," What part of ""he doesn't care"" are you not registering?"
33903,Enzo," Where were we? Uh, ah, right. I was telling my story, and you were all politely listening. So I'd given Damon all of my bl*od ration so he'd have the strength to escape and save me in the process. Our plan began perfectly, didn't it? I was waiting in the cage for him to release me, waiting for my friend, my cellmate, the only soul with whom I'd connected with in all those years of captivity. Then a fire starts, burns out of control, but Damon just can't get the damn cage open. He looks me in the eye as if he doesn't even recognize me, turns around, saves himself, leaving me to die"
33904,Stefan," Well, you didn't die obviously"
33905,Enzo," No. Unfortunately I lived. I was spared by one of the scientists so I could spend another 50 years on a table being opened and closed. Now that we've all been acquainted, I'm gonna go find something to wet my whistle"
33906,Stefan, You didn't tell me about him
33907,Damon," It was the 1950s. I'm supposed to remember every moment of my life? Do you want to k*ll Aaron, or should I?"
33908,Stefan," This guy was your cellmate for 5 years, you left him to die, he comes back, and you're completely unfazed?"
33909,Damon, Fine. I will
33910,Aaron," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wes gave me a bunch of files on my family history. They're in my dorm, ok? Maybe there's something in there you need, a name, I mean, another lab"
33911,Damon, That's a timely revelation
33912,Aaron," Yeah. Well, you know, he's not gonna help me, so why should I help him?"
33913,Damon," I don't like you, I don't like your family, I don't like you messing with my relationship. If you're lying, I'm gonna take my thumbs, and I'm gonna gouge out your sad little eyes out of your sad little head!"
33914,Enzo,Ah. It's frightening what you can find on campus these days
33915,Stefan," Knock yourself out. We're going with plan ""B"""
33916,Enzo," Damon's not. Damon's staying right here. He knows all my secrets, so he knows how ornery I can get when I don't get my way"
33917,Damon," Call me if you find anything, k*ll him if you don't"
33918,Stefan, Come on
33919,Katherine, You didn't just propose spirit possession with a straight face?
33920,Nadia," You said my grandfather was a Traveler, which means your father was a Traveler. Therefore, you are a Traveler. We just need to find one who can teach you how to do the passenger spell"
33921,Katherine," Hang on. I'm hardly a Traveler, ok? My father banned us from doing Traveler magic. He said it was the devil's work or something dramatic that terrified us, and then I became a vampire and never thought about it again"
33922,Nadia," But it's in your bl*od, which means you have the ability to keep living inside someone else's body. Gregor was a Traveler. He put his spirit inside Matte's body. So that even after his body died he lived on"
33923,Katherine," Yes! He lived on in a busboy. Good idea, Nadia. Let's put my essence in some nobody. Thing is, Stefan actually likes this body"
33924,Nadia, What are you talking about?
33925,Katherine, Stefan and I may have rekindled an old flame last night
33926,Nadia," I see. So when you asked me about forgiveness, you were asking about him, not me?"
33927,Katherine," Look. Maybe I don't want to die a sad, lonely 538-year-old. If I have to bow out, knowing that Stefan still cares might not be the worst way to go"
33928,Nadia," No. You had it right the first time. Go k*ll yourself, see if anyone misses you"
33929,Enzo, What about cricket? That ever become a thing here?
33930,Damon, No
33931,Enzo," Oh, shame. Fun sport. Not that I can play. Took up drawing for a while. Of course I had no pencil, so I'd just prick my finger and paint the cell wall with my bl*od"
33932,Damon, What do you want? You want me to feel guilty? I couldn't save you. Now where's Elena? What's wrong with you?
33933,Enzo, Wes injected me with poison that will stop my heart. I'll desiccate if I don't return for the antidote
33934,Damon," All the more reason to tell me where he is. Look. You get the antidote, I'll save my girlfriend, we'll k*ll Wes together"
33935,Enzo," Did you even think about it after you left, the experiments, the cell, or did you just go out and live your merry life to its fullest?"
33936,Damon," Look at me. If you go back, we go back together. We finish this for good. Come on"
33937,Enzo," You're not gonna see your girl again, Damon, because I want the antidote, and Wes told me not to come back until you were dead. I imagine you just broke your clavicle. Probably a few lumbar and thoracic vertebrae. It's funny what you learn about your body when it's taken apart like a bloody automobile right before your eyes!"
33938,Damon," I'm not gonna fight you, Enzo"
33939,Enzo," What are you gonna do then, run?You're good at that"
33940,Damon, I want to find my girlfriend
33941,Enzo," While you were out running wild, I had one single thought, that I'd have the pleasure of k*ll you"
33942,Damon," Enzo, look at me"
33943,Enzo, Bloody poison!
33944,Damon, Where is she? Where's Elena.Tell me where she is!
33945,Enzo, Or what?! You never see her again? It might be good for you to know what it's like to miss someone for the next 60 years
33946,Damon," Enzo, look at me. Hey! Enzo! Where is she? Where is she? Enzo, hey"
33947,Aaron, All the files of my family history are in here
33948,Stefan," Hurry up. Is this all a lie, huh? If you want me to k*ll you, I will k*ll you. Do not test me"
33949,Aaron, Do it. I'm dead already. Damon's been planning my death since before I was born
33950,Stefan, What are you talking about?
33951,Aaron," Damon left out the best part of the Augustine story, the part after he escaped"
33952,Stefan, Talk
33953,Aaron," It wasn't enough for Damon to k*ll the doctors who tortured him. He had to torture their families and their future families. He spent the last 60 years k*ll every one of my relatives except he's a psychopath. He leaves one alive so that they can continue the family line so that he can destroy future generations of innocent people. So go ahead and do it, k*ll me because I don't want to give Damon the satisfaction, so do it. Do it!"
33954,Stefan," You know, not all of us are like my brother"
33955,Aaron, Stefan? This is everything Wes gave me on Augustine. I saw Elena's last name on a few pages. Maybe it will help
33956,Grayson," Hey. You're not supposed to be down here. Basement's a kid-free zone, remember?"
33957,Elena, I heard someone screaming
33958,Grayson," Oh, it's ok. Everything's fine. In fact, today's a good day, Elena"
33959,Elena, Why?
33960,Grayson," Daddy's gonna save a little girl's life. She's just about the same age as you. Pretty cool, huh? All right. Get out of here. Doctor's orders"
33961,Elena, Ok dad
33962,Wes, Good news. The sample cells mutated. My compound worked
33963,Elena," I don't follow. You kicked me out of bio, remember?"
33964,Wes, You've heard of Pavlov? Conditioned his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell. This compound is like that bell except instead of a ding your body will salivate at the smell of vampire bl*od
33965,Elena," Oh, my God. That's what you did to Jesse. You turned him into some rabid vampire who only wanted to feed on other vampires"
33966,Wes," Jesse was a fantastic case study, but he took too long to condition, and considering the size of the vampire population, a single-dose injection is much more efficient"
33967,Elena," Yeah, but he couldn't stop feeding. He tried to k*ll Damon"
33968,Wes," Exactly. Vampires are now one sh*t away from craving their own kind, and you're about to be patient zero"
33969,Elena," What? No. No, you can't do that to me. You'll turn me into a ripper"
33970,Wes, I know. Subject 83182 prepped for compound injection
33971,Elena, No. Please. You can't do this to me
33972,Wes," You'll be doing the world a favor, Elena. I might not be able to k*ll vampires..."
33973,Elena, No! Let me go!
33974,Wes, But you will
33975,Elena, No
33976,Stefan, Elena
33977,Elena," Stefan! Oh, God. Ohh"
33978,Stefan, Come here. Oh. You're ok. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you
33979,Elena, Get me out of here. Come on. Come on get me out of here
33980,Matt," Look. We're closing, so..."
33981,Nadia," We met on a little patio like this, remember? The twinkling lights, music. That was a fun night"
33982,Matt," Yeah. I'd kind of rather just put us, um, behind us"
33983,Nadia," Fine. Will do, but I need you to hold on to this for me"
33984,Matt, The Travelers' kn*fe? No way. I just got rid of that thing
33985,Nadia," It's not about you. I'm leaving Mystic Falls, and I need to know it's safe"
33986,Matt, Why? and why do people want it?
33987,Nadia," I thought I could convince Katherine to live a little longer. I was wrong, but if she changes her mind, she will need this. That's all you need to know"
33988,Matt," Well, she won't because Katherine cares about Katherine and only Katherine. If she doesn't want to do something, then she won't"
33989,Nadia, I spent 500 years searching for her. I finally find her only to lose her all over again. I don't know if I should hate her for giving up or be at her side when she dies
33990,Matt," Listen, I get the whole crappy parenting thing. My mom kind of sucked. She was selfish, and she drank too much and never really thought about how it would affect me"
33991,Nadia, Then you know what it's like to hold on to the hope that maybe just once she'll do what you want
33992,Matt," If she changes her mind, the kn*fe will be with me"
33993,Damon, Oh. Never mind
33994,Enzo, What did you do now?
33995,Damon," Well, I injected you with a bunch of these that say, ""Antidote,"" and apparently, one of them worked"
33996,Enzo," If this is some attempt to make amends, it's a bit pathetic, mate"
33997,Damon," I don't care about amends, mate. My girlfriend's safe, so technically, I'm not suffering, and it'd really suck if you desiccated in vain... And I'm gonna tell you my side of the story. You asked me if I thought about you after I escaped, and answer is no, and I sure as hell don't feel guilty about leaving you because in order for me to save myself and leave you, I had to shut off my humanity, damn it, so I flipped the switch, and then I felt nothing, no remorse, no regret, no pain"
33998,Enzo," And now what do you feel, remorse, regret, pain? Even if I forgave you, Damon, would that make you less of a horrible person?"
33999,Damon," We're even, Enzo"
34000,Enzo," You were the most important person in my life, and you ruined me, but that's just who you are, that's who you'll always be... A monster"
34001,Elena," It's weird. Even as a kid, there was something about that basement that creeped me out"
34002,Damon, Sure you want to give yourself nightmares reading that thing?
34003,Elena," And I remember my dad talking about this little girl. I think he was talking about my roommate Megan. Look. ""January 1999. Saw Megan King today. Megan is 7 years old. She suffers from a congenital heart defect with a life expectancy of two months. A single injection of vampire bl*od appears to be an effective life-saving solution."" That's why Megan had a picture of my dad on her phone… because he saved her life"
34004,Damon, A hundred pages of horrific torture and you find the one happy passage
34005,Elena," My dad used his research to save people, Damon, children, families"
34006,Damon," Yeah. And dissected vamps along the way. News flash, Elena. You are a vampire. I mean, do you honestly think that he would sit here and see you as anything more?"
34007,Elena, I don't know. He was my dad. I can't not defend him
34008,Damon, No. I know you can't because you do it for me all the time
34009,Elena," I'm not defending you. I'm not defending your decision to k*ll Aaron's entire family, to go out of town and k*ll the aunt while we were still together"
34010,Damon," So why are you still here? I'm bad, Elena, I am bad for you, so why wouldn't you have run away from me as far as humanly possible?"
34011,Elena," Because I love you, Damon, because I chose you, and because I stand by my choice"
34012,Damon," Well, now I'm choosing, and I'm choosing to let you go"
34013,Elena," What? No, Damon"
34014,Damon, I am choosing to not have to think about how you must feel every time some ghost from my past comes into our life. I'm choosing to relieve you of having to defend me for every awful thing I've ever done
34015,Elena," Stop acting like I'm perfect. Damon, I've done horrible things, too. You think I'm gonna stand here and judge you after I find out that you've been tortured for 5 years?"
34016,Damon, Stop defending me! I won't change who I am. I can't... But I refuse to change you
34017,Stefan," Can I come in, or are you gonna freak out and run away again?"
34018,Katherine, I'm getting wrinkles
34019,Stefan, Heh. Katherine Pierce's chickens come home to roost. In the form of wrinkles. It's kind of brilliant
34020,Katherine," What's the opposite of funny? Oh, right. Not funny"
34021,Stefan," Hmm. So what are you, uh, doing in my room?"
34022,Katherine, I want to talk about last night
34023,Stefan, Ok
34024,Katherine, So talk
34025,Stefan," Well, um, it was a long day, we had a moment, and we got swept up in it"
34026,Katherine, Did you memorize that from... A textbook or something?
34027,Stefan," Katherine, what do you expect? You want me just forget everything that you've put me through for the last 147 years?"
34028,Katherine," I'm dying, Stefan"
34029,Stefan," I know you are, and I'm sure that you will figure a way out of it"
34030,Katherine," No. I mean, it's for real this time. Look at me. I'm dying. What does someone have to go through to get a little redemption around here?"
34031,Stefan, 147 years is a long time to forgive in one night
34032,Katherine," One night... An eternity... You'd never look at me the way you look at Elena, would you? Good night, Stefan"
34033,Stefan, Hey. I'm sorry that you're dying
34034,Katherine," Trust me. I am, too"
34035,Aaron, Wes? Wes?
34036,Wes, Aaron?
34037,Aaron," What the hell is this place, huh?"
34038,Wes, It's one of Augustine's research labs
34039,Aaron, Do you really think that you're helping people with this vampire crap?You sold me out! You used my life as a bargaining chip
34040,Wes," Aaron, I'm sorry"
34041,Aaron, I never want to see you again. Get the hell out of my life
34042,Wes, Aaron. Aaron!
34043,Katherine, So do we have a deal? You'll find me a Traveler that will teach me how to do the spell?
34044,Nadia, I guess this means you want to live
34045,Katherine, I'm a survivor. Staying alive is my specialty
34046,Nadia, Mm-hmm. Assuming of course it's on your terms. Clearly Stefan inspired some profound thinking
34047,Katherine, I think Stefan believes that a part of me can still be redeemed
34048,Nadia, And what do you think? Is he right? Hello? Katherine? Katherine?
34049,Tyler, Do you know the reason we're together? Because Klaus granted us permission to be together. I can't live like that.
34050,"Katherine, voice-over", I'm dying of old age.
34051,Doctor, Clear! Give me 200 joules. Charged. Clear!
34052,Nadia, It doesn't make sense. I was just speaking with her. She sounded fine
34053,Stefan," Doctors think it was a, um, heart attack"
34054,Nadia, Trust me. Katherine Pierce is not going to die from a heart attack. We both know my mother. She will fight this
34055,Stefan," She's dying. Every single organ in her body is failing. Vampire bl*od can't save her. I compelled the doctors to let me take her home so she's more comfortable, but she's dying. They don't think she'll survive the rest of the day"
34056,Caroline," Ok. Time to wake up, sleepyhead"
34057,Elena, No! I'm not leaving this bed
34058,Bonnie, Which is why we brought breakfast to you
34059,Elena, What's all this?
34060,Caroline, This is your breakup breakfast!
34061,Elena, My what?
34062,Jeremy, Damon dumped Elena
34063,Matt, Why?
34064,Jeremy, I have no idea
34065,Matt, Who spends two years pining after a girl to dump her?
34066,Damon," I can hear you, dumbass"
34067,Bonnie, So that's it? You're just giving up?
34068,Caroline," As she should! I mean, he did say… and I quote… ""I am a bad person. I am bad for you, and I am choosing to let you go."""
34069,Elena, You memorized my breakup?
34070,Caroline, Of course I did. Drink this
34071,Matt, So you sure it was just a fight?
34072,Elena," I just have to face reality. If Damon makes up his mind about something, it's done"
34073,Caroline, It's Stefan
34074,Elena, Tell him I don't feel like talking
34075,Caroline, She doesn't feel like talking
34076,Stefan," Well, she's gonna want to talk about this"
34077,Damon," Rule number one, think of the worst thing Katherine Pierce has ever done to you. Rule number two, toast to the glory of her impending death. Rule number 3, if you come across something that's worse… which you will… repeat rules one and two. She pretended to be buried in a tomb for 145 years while I waited for her lying ass. Wait. Does that b*at pretending to be Elena and kissing me on the front porch of your old house?"
34078,Jeremy, I don't think so
34079,Damon," I don't think so either. Damn. Quarterback, go"
34080,Matt, Uh...
34081,Damon, Think on that. Little Gilbert
34082,Jeremy," She fed to my Silas, and I died"
34083,Damon, Doozy
34084,Jeremy, Then she made me crash my car into a pole and left me for dead again
34085,Damon, Double doozy. Drink
34086,Matt, My sister's dead because of her
34087,Damon," Yes, she is because I wouldn't have even been in town to turn Vicki into a m*rder vampire if I wasn't trying to get Katherine out of a tomb she wasn't in. Group sh*t"
34088,Elena, Seriously?
34089,Matt," Elena, we were just, uh…"
34090,Elena, I know what you're doing
34091,Elena," You're cut off. If anyone is drinking to Katherine's last days, it's gonna be me. She impersonated me repeatedly... Made Aunt Jenna stab herself in the stomach and cut off Uncle John's fingers"
34092,Jeremy, He might have deserved that
34093,Bonnie, My grams died trying to close a tomb she wasn't in
34094,Caroline, Tyler's werewolf curse got triggered because of her
34095,Elena," Klaus followed her to Mystic Falls, and because of that, we lost Jenna"
34096,Damon, And Alaric
34097,Matt, We're gonna need more booze
34098,Elena, She tried to k*ll me at least twice
34099,Caroline," She did k*ll me, although I'm weirdly better off"
34100,Katherine," They're talking about me, aren't they?"
34101,Stefan, They're reminiscing
34102,Katherine, It's fine. I'm sure I deserve everything that they're saying. Does my hand look wrinkled to you?
34103,Stefan, It looks fine
34104,Katherine," If I start to sag anywhere, you take a kn*fe and you jam it into my carotid artery immediately, ok?"
34105,Stefan, Ok
34106,Katherine, What?
34107,Stefan," You know, even on your death bed, you're vain"
34108,Katherine," Hey. If a girl's got to go, it may as well be glamorous, right? That's definitely an age spot"
34109,Stefan," This is not an age spot, Katherine"
34110,Katherine, You're being too nice to me. Why?
34111,Stefan, You're dying. I think I can muster up a little bit of compassion
34112,Matt, Nadia
34113,Damon, Rumor has it she burnt down the entire city of Atlanta once
34114,Jeremy, That might win
34115,Stefan, All right. Knock it off or take it somewhere else. You guys are being insensitive
34116,Damon," Come on, Stefan. Don't let the sight of a frail, human, Elena look-alike cloud your memories of the manipulative psycho that she is"
34117,Stefan," In 1864, Katherine moved into my home, she compelled me to love her, seduced my brother, fed us full of vampire bl*od, and then started a w*r with the town that got us k*ll"
34118,Damon, Exactly. Bottoms up
34119,Stefan," But centuries before that, she was just an innocent girl who was shunned by her family, so for 500 years, she lied and manipulated and did whatever she had to do survive, and she did. She’s a survivor. So that's the girl that I will drink to today. Cheers"
34120,Damon, Please. One night of hot sex with her and you're brainwashed?
34121,Elena, What?!
34122,Caroline," Oh, my… I forgot to tell you. You were kidnapped and hostaged and… bottle's empty"
34123,Damon," Actually, that's why you never send a busboy to do a man's job"
34124,Damon," Nadia, the devil's spawn. Hey, Caroline. Did you remember to tell Elena that?"
34125,Elena, I think my mind just exploded. Ok. Katherine's upstairs
34126,Nadia," Actually, I'm here to see all of you. I found a way to save my mother, and I need some help"
34127,Damon, Uh-uh. No way. Even my biased brother knows I will kick his ass from here to Kentucky if he helps Katherine Pierce live one more day on this earth. No volunteers
34128,Nadia," I figured as much, which is why I found that old safe your brother spent his summer drowning in and buried it on this property with your friend Matt inside of it. Oh. Without this"
34129,Elena, What?!
34130,Nadia, I figured you two would be my volunteers
34131,Elena, Congratulations on your intuition. We're here. We volunteered. Now tell us where Matt is
34132,Nadia, Matt will be freed once you help me get what I need
34133,Stefan, Which is what exactly?
34134,Nadia, I need a Traveler. Katherine was born into a traveler bloodline. She can make herself be a passenger in someone else's body if a Traveler teaches her how to do it
34135,Elena, Like your boyfriend Gregor hopped a ride in Matt's body until Katherine k*ll him of course. Your mother k*ll your boyfriend. Why are we saving her again?
34136,Stefan," Gregor was gonna k*ll her, and she was protecting herself"
34137,Elena," Oh, please don't defend her, especially now that you've…"
34138,Stefan, Now that I've slept with her. I'm sure you have plenty to say about that
34139,Nadia, We're here
34140,Elena, So we're just supposed to help you let Katherine take over someone's life?
34141,Nadia, Not just anyone's life. Mine. I'm going to make her a passenger in my body
34142,Jeremy, I don't see any freshly dug ground
34143,Bonnie, This property it massive
34144,Caroline," Hello! Is no one gonna comment on the fact that Stefan slept with Katherine? I mean, that's kind of a big deal"
34145,Jeremy, Does it matter? We've all slept with our fair share of bad choices
34146,Bonnie, No offense taken
34147,Jeremy, No. Obviously not you
34148,Caroline, Bonnie Bennett! Wait. Did you two? And you didn't tell me?
34149,Bonnie, I didn't think I was obligated
34150,Caroline," Of course you were obligated. You're my best friend. Oh, my God! Does Elena know that her little brother…"
34151,Bonnie/Jeremy, No!
34152,Caroline," Aw! Scandalous sex! Even better! God, how am I the only person on the planet who's not having scandalous sex?"
34153,Jeremy, Why don't we split up and think about that?
34154,Caroline, Good idea. We'll cover more ground that way
34155,Katherine," No, no! No, mama. No!"
34156,Damon, What a mess
34157,Katherine, Damon?
34158,Damon," Ok. I'll say it. I miss Klaus. I mean, the way this guy used to torture you. Sword in the daddy. Nice touch"
34159,Katherine, Get out of my head
34160,Damon," Remind me how this slaughter went down again. Oh, right. Klaus was gonna k*ll you in a bl*od sacrifice, and you, being you, ran for the hills, only to come back and find your entire family had been massacred. So if I'm adding this up right, your family's entire death was all your fault"
34161,Katherine, No! No! No! No!
34162,Liz," Put the pillow down, Damon"
34163,Damon, Liz
34164,Liz," If you k*ll her, it's m*rder. I mean, I'd have to bring you in, lock you up. There's all that paperwork"
34165,Damon," Every awful thing I've ever done is linked to her. She taught me how to k*ll, how to enjoy it. She ruined me, and I can't take any of that back"
34166,Liz, Look at how much control she still has over you. Prove her wrong
34167,Caroline," Matt! Matt, we're coming for you!"
34168,Klaus," Hello, Caroline"
34169,Caroline, Klaus
34170,Stefan, Not exactly the Ritz
34171,Nadia," Travelers don't have much. They're always on the move, but on the plus side, sometimes their services can be bought. I found one who named the right price"
34172,Woman, You brought them
34173,Nadia," Yes, Mia. Are you ready to make the deal?"
34174,Elena, What's going on?
34175,Stefan, I have the feeling the right price for the deal was us
34176,Nadia," I'm sorry, but they asked for doppelgangers. No idea why"
34177,Elena, Our rings. They're messing with them. We can't go outside
34178,Caroline, Sorry. Matt's buried alive. No time to chat
34179,Klaus, You're not even the least bit curious as to why I'm here?
34180,Caroline," I literally just whooshed at the sight of your face, so no"
34181,Klaus, Damon informed me that Katerina Petrova has taken a tragic turn
34182,Caroline," So you're here to gloat over her corpse to be, to delight in the closure of 500 years of revenge! Great! Now I'm even less interested"
34183,Klaus," Well, then perhaps you'd be more interested in talking about Tyler"
34184,Caroline, Is he… did you…
34185,Klaus," No. I sent him off with little more than a bruised ego. He really does hate me, poor lad. Revenge, it eats at him. I hear you two broke up"
34186,Caroline," Because I made him choose… me or his stupid revenge fantasy, and he chose wrong. I suggest that you learn from his mistakes and let Katherine die in peace. Dying sucks enough learn as it is. No need to rub anyone's nose in it"
34187,Liz, Ok. Here's the sedatives from the hospital. Should help with the pain
34188,Katherine," I don't want them. They make me weak, and when I'm weak, he can get in my head"
34189,Liz, Ok. Suit yourself. They're right here if you want them
34190,Liz, Still looking for Matt? Any word from Elena?
34191,Damon, We're not on a speaking basis
34192,Katherine," Didn't you hear, Sheriff? He was so afraid to dirty her... white dove feathers that he let her little wings fly free, and it was all my fault. Oops"
34193,Damon, That'll shut her up for a while
34194,Katherine, How much further until we reach this Lockwood plantation?
34195,Emily, Won't be long now. We've just entered the town of Mystic Falls
34196,Katherine, Good. What is it now?
34197,Emily, Looks like a gentleman's having some problems with his carriage
34198,Katherine," At this rate, we won't arrive until sundown. What does it matter if…"
34199,Stefan, Thanks for your help. I should be all right
34200,Katherine," Who is that? He's so handsome. What do you say, Emily? Think that gentleman's family would take in a poor orphan girl from Atlanta?"
34201,Damon, What the hell was that?
34202,Katherine," You never heard the real story of how I came to meet your brother? I want to think that this prophecy of the universe bringing the doppelgangers together is absurd, but the moment that I saw Stefan… I can't describe it… the out-of-the-way road, the downed tree, the broken-down carriage, it just… it sounds like fate to me"
34203,Elena, This isn't awkward
34204,Stefan," Guess we probably picked the wrong day to be in a fight, huh?"
34205,Elena," I'm sorry, ok? It's not my place to judge, especially after everything that you've been through. You don't happen to speak Czech, do you?"
34206,Stefan, No
34207,Elena, Ok. Stefan?
34208,Elena, It's ok. I guess he wants doppelganger bl*od
34209,Elena, Should we knock his head off?
34210,Stefan," Depends. If I k*ll him, do the rest of these boards fall down?"
34211,Elena, Right. bl*od it is. Why aren't we healing?
34212,Caroline, Matt! Matt!
34213,Klaus, Would you give me the same choice?
34214,Caroline, What?
34215,Klaus," Were I to abandon my revenge against Katerina, would you offer me the same choice as Tyler?"
34216,Caroline, I don't know what you mean
34217,Klaus," Yes, you do"
34218,Caroline, You… you can't do this to me. You can't just show up and distract me while my friend is in danger
34219,Klaus," You know, while you've been vamping off in all the wrong directions, I heard Matt's distant and desperate screams"
34220,Caroline, Where?
34221,Klaus," Don't worry, luv. I've got it covered. Trust me. He'll be quite happy with his rescuer"
34222,Rebekah," I'm gone not 3 months, and look at the trouble you're in"
34223,Katherine, Just go away. Don't you think that you've made your point?
34224,Jenna, What point? Like this one?
34225,Katherine, Jenna?
34226,Jenna, Remember when you compelled me to stab myself?
34227,Katherine," No, no. No, no, no! Unh!"
34228,Damon, Poor Aunt Jenna. I had to compel her to think that she walked into that kn*fe. She was so confused
34229,Katherine, No. No. No more drugs!
34230,John," Hello, fingers. Good-bye, fingers"
34231,Elijah, Enough!
34232,Katherine, Elijah
34233,Elijah, Katerina
34234,Katherine, You're here
34235,Damon," I'm so sorry. Did you think that that was real? Nope. No one's coming to say good-bye, Katherine, because no one cares"
34236,Nadia, I do
34237,Damon, Come on
34238,Nadia, Let's get on with this
34239,Stefan, Guess it's a good thing I'm not claustrophobic anymore
34240,Elena, That's what Katherine helped you with… Silas aftermath
34241,Stefan, She did
34242,Elena, Can I just hate her anyway?
34243,Stefan, You can
34244,Elena, Thank you
34245,Stefan," But I don't. I know I should, but for some reason, I keep rooting for her to find peace. Katherine's not the only one, you know? Damon keeps pushing you away because he hates himself, who he is, what he's done. Just remember that you never gave up on me, so don't give up on him. Don't let him give up on you either, ok?"
34246,Elena, So that's it? All you needed from us was a bucket of bl*od? Let's get out of here
34247,Stefan, Come on
34248,Mia, Repeat the spell so I know you understand how the passenger works
34249,Katherine, I can't
34250,Nadia," Just say it. Jaryakat a zem. Daryeet acza. Say it, and it's done. Your spirit goes inside my body, Mia will activate you by calling you forth, and you get to live"
34251,Katherine," Can I have a moment with my daughter, please?"
34252,Nadia, I know what you're going to say… We don't have time for this
34253,Katherine," Nadia... Letting my father rip you out of my arms, it was the biggest regret of my life. I should have fought harder to keep you, but I didn't. So I spent the next 500 years making sure that I never made that mistake again. I fought for everything, and in the process, I had a long, full life, and I got to know my beautiful daughter. And you spent the last centuries searching for me. Don't waste another minute on me. It's your turn to live"
34254,Nadia, I can't do this
34255,Katherine, Let me. I've made selfish decisions all my life. Let me do the right thing for once
34256,Nadia," Fine. Then go. Leave me. Drift off into oblivion, but I will not sit by your side and watch you die"
34257,Klaus, So the quarterback has been saved. What now?
34258,Caroline, Don't you have a dying girl to go punish for all of her sins?
34259,Klaus," I do, but I won't for you"
34260,Caroline, So you came all the way to Mystic Falls just to back off when I ask you to?
34261,Klaus," No. I came all the way to Mystic Falls to gloat over a corpse to be, as you so poetically put it, but I will leave minus the gloating in return for one small thing"
34262,Caroline, And what is that?
34263,Klaus, I want your confession
34264,Caroline, My confession? I didn't do anything. Confession about what?
34265,Klaus," Me. As soon as we're done here, I'm gonna walk away, and I'm never coming back. You'll never again have to look me in the eye and cover our connection with hostility and revulsion. You'll never have to loathe the darkest parts of yourself that care for me in spite of all I've done. I will be gone, and you will be free. I just... Want you to be honest with me"
34266,Caroline," I'm in college. I'm building a life for myself. I have plans and a future and things that I want, and none of those things involve you, ok, none of them"
34267,Klaus, I see
34268,Caroline," No, you don't because, yes, I cover our connection with hostility because, yes, I hate myself for the truth, so if you promise to walk away like you said and never come back, then, yes, I will be honest with you. I will be honest with you about what I want"
34269,Klaus," I will walk away, and I'll never come back, I promise"
34270,Stefan, What the hell happened to you?
34271,Damon," In a shocking twist, Katherine's daughter's a psychopath. Whew. She's all yours. I've had fun messing with her mind all day"
34272,Stefan, Damon
34273,Damon," I know, Stefan, I know. It's been a rough couple days. I needed an outlet, ok?"
34274,Stefan, Hi
34275,Katherine, These drugs are... Hardcore
34276,Stefan, Close your eyes. I came to say bye
34277,Katherine, I want to see you
34278,Stefan, You will
34279,Stefan," So this is the memory you came back to? A little dark, no?"
34280,Katherine," Damon already had his fun with this one. This was the worst day of my life. He said it was my fault, that I deserved everything bad that's ever happened to me. He's right. He was right, Stefan I don't deserve to be loved"
34281,Stefan, Open your mind to me. Look at your father
34282,Katherine, He's gone. What are you doing?
34283,Stefan, You deserve to feel peace
34284,Katherine, Mother!
34285,Stefan, You were a 17-year-old girl. Katherine... None of this is your fault
34286,Stefan," Good-bye, Katherine"
34287,Elena, Is she...
34288,Stefan," Not yet. With these drugs, she won't wake up again"
34289,Stefan," You know, I was in a dark place, Damon"
34290,Damon, And Katherine pulled you out of it. Irony abounds
34291,Stefan," You know, whatever is going on with you and Elena, you need to fix it. She's the best thing that ever happened to you"
34292,Damon," What, don't you think I know that? I can't live without her... But when you think about it, I'm no better than Katherine. Elena will be happier without me. What, I'm being selfless? Don't give me that look"
34293,Stefan, I'm not giving you a look
34294,Damon," Katherine fricking Pierce has a selfless moment, I'm not allowed to? Fine. Fine.When I get Elena back and the whole universe freaks out because the fated doppelgangers are torn apart, just remember you… you're the one that pep talked me out of doing the right thing for the universe and all mankind"
34295,Stefan, I will keep that in mind
34296,Damon, You do that
34297,Matt, Hey. Where have you been?
34298,Caroline, In the woods. I got lost. So what are we doing?
34299,Jeremy, We are waiting for Katherine to bite it
34300,Matt," So this anchor thing, does it mean that you'll, like, be able to feel Katherine's death or whatever?"
34301,Bonnie," I think so. I mean, she's human, but she's also a doppelganger and Traveler apparently"
34302,Matt, So who else do you see over there? Anybody I know?
34303,Bonnie," I see lots of people. My grams, the other witches. Vicki. I just don't talk about it, you know, just…"
34304,Vicki, because it's depressing as hell. Tell Matty I love him
34305,Matt, What's happening?
34306,Bonnie, She's here. She said she loves you
34307,Vicki, Tell him that I watch over him and no more knocking around with that blond original chick who almost got him k*ll
34308,Matt, Wait. Wait. What's happening? What am I missing?
34309,Tyler, Me
34310,Caroline, Tyler?
34311,Tyler," Rebekah says to tell you I'm her parting gift. Hey, care"
34312,Caroline, Hi
34313,Stefan, We've really gone through 4 bottles of bourbon today?
34314,Alaric, Can someone tell these idiots to lay off the booze?
34315,Bonnie," Oh, my God"
34316,Jeremy, Alaric?
34317,Damon, Ric's here?
34318,Jeremy, Where the hell have you been? I thought you bailed on us to go find peace or something
34319,Alaric, Do you honestly think I'd leave Damon in charge and never look back?
34320,Damon," He's talking about me, isn't he?"
34321,Jeremy, He says you're a dick
34322,Damon," Cheers, buddy"
34323,Alaric,
34324,Bonnie, Katherine
34325,Damon, Ding-dong. Does that mean the witch is dead?
34326,Katherine, No. It's too soon. I can't!
34327,Elena," Wow. You really don't want to die, do you? I swear I just heard your heart stop"
34328,Katherine, Where am I?
34329,Elena, Still alive... Sadly
34330,Katherine," I thought I was a goner there for a second, but I still have unfinished business"
34331,Elena, So do I. I had this whole speech that I was preparing to give your unconscious body
34332,Katherine," Let me guess. Hate, loathe, screw you, die, bitch, et cetera"
34333,Elena, Yes. Plus one more thing. I forgive you
34334,Katherine, You what?
34335,Elena," I forgive you. You weren't born evil. Your life made you that way. You lost everyone that you cared about way too young, and you didn't have a family that looked after you. Sound familiar?"
34336,Katherine," Is this the... ""We're not so different you and I"" doppelganger speech? Because I'd be happy to skip it"
34337,Elena, I'll save it for the funeral that we probably won't have for you
34338,Katherine, Perfect
34339,Elena, I just wanted to get the forgiveness part out. It's part of me that I... I never want to lose
34340,Katherine," Good for you. Now maybe you can help a girl out and give me one more syringe, and if anyone's gonna plunge a needle in me one last time, may as well be you. Symmetry and all that. Elena... Thank you for your forgiveness"
34341,Elena, You're welcome
34342,Nadia, Hello? Are you there?
34343,Elena/Katherine, I'm here
34344,Nadia, Talk to me. Did it work?
34345,Elena/Katherine, Of course it worked. I'm Katherine Pierce. I survive. I'll see you soon
34346,Katherine, Hi. I'm Elena Gilbert
34347,Elena, Guess who!
34348,Matt, Hmm. I wonder. Elena Gilbert?
34349,Elena, Yep
34350,Matt, You're in a good mood
34351,Elena," Well, it's a good day. We're alive"
34352,Matt," Yes, we are, and we are partying tonight"
34353,Elena," Yes, we are"
34354,Matt, So what did you want to talk to me about?
34355,Elena, Are you still drinking Vervain?
34356,Matt," No. I wear this bracelet in case anyone needs my bl*od, remember?"
34357,Elena, This is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you
34358,Matt, What are you doing? I need that
34359,Elena," Long story short-- I'm Katherine, not Elena"
34360,Matt, Katherine's dead
34361,Elena/Katherine," Not exactly. While you guys were all playing drinking games, toasting to what a horrible person I am, I was plotting a way to passenger myself into Elena's cute, little head"
34362,Matt," Oh, my God"
34363,Elena/Katherine," Anyway, I need a crash course on all things Elena Gilbert. She's in college now, all grown up, and I figured who knows her better than her compellable best friend? So what do you think? How's my dress? It screams safe and predictable. Am I right, or am I right?"
34364,Matt, I'm not doing this
34365,Nadia, Just compel him already
34366,Elena/Katherine," Take the fun right out of it, why don't you? Play along with my secret, Matty pants. Would Elena wear this outfit to a party?"
34367,Matt," No to the dress, yes to the shoes"
34368,Elena/Katherine, Now let's talk honestly about the red thing that's happening in my hair
34369,Matt," So you're dead and, what, hitching a ride in her brain?"
34370,Elena/Katherine, For now until I make it permanent
34371,Matt, Permanent? How?
34372,Elena/Katherine, Hello! The hair. Why did she dye it?
34373,Matt, I don't know. She did it in New York right after she shut her humanity off
34374,Elena/Katherine, But her humanity's back now. Perfect. It's gone. Ok. What's Jeremy's birthday?
34375,Matt, October 13
34376,Elena/Katherine, When's Elena's birthday?
34377,Matt, June 22
34378,Elena/Katherine, What's my address?
34379,Matt," 2104 maple street, but you burnt your house down"
34380,Elena/Katherine," I know, that was a trick question. Good job! Who do I like better… Bonnie or Caroline? Please say Caroline"
34381,Matt, You love them both equally
34382,Elena/Katherine," Well, that's a shocker. Ok. I just have one last question. It's very important because I'm going to need it later. How exactly did Elena Gilbert break up with you?"
34383,Nadia, Mia said she needs your corpse
34384,Katherine/Elena, My corpse? Could travelers be any creepier?
34385,Nadia," Be nice. Without Mia, you wouldn't be alive or inside Elena's body right now"
34386,Katherine/Elena," I know. I'd be dead in my corpse, a corpse that some traveler says that they need. You see how that's creepy?"
34387,Nadia, Do you want to be in control of Elena's body or not?
34388,Katherine/Elena," Look. I get it, ok? We have no idea when Elena's consciousness is gonna pop out. Now you want to tell me what you're doing over there?"
34389,Nadia, Get on the bed. Just in case Elena decides to show up while I'm out getting your body 
34390,Katherine/Elena," So I'm just gonna be stuck in a hotel room, bound to a bed while Damon Salvatore's leaving me voicemails? Remind me again how this is better than being dead"
34391,Nadia," Because once Mia does her spell, Elena will be gone forever, and this body will be yours for good"
34392,Stefan, Where you been?
34393,Damon, Just out
34394,Stefan, Define out
34395,Damon, One who hovers and sticks his nose in other people's business. Oh. I'm sorry. I was defining annoying
34396,Stefan, That's funny
34397,Damon, Katherine's rotting corpse was stinking up the house. I got rid of it
34398,Stefan, Could be a bit of a problem
34399,Damon, Oh? And why is that?
34400,Nadia, Because I'm here for Katherine's body
34401,Damon, You're out of luck. You ain't getting it
34402,Nadia, My mother asked to be buried with her family in Bulgaria
34403,Damon, And nothing gives me greater joy than to deny her dying wish
34404,Stefan," Damon, who cares? Katherine's dead. Just give her the damn body"
34405,Damon," Bitch ruined our lives. Nadia's known her, what, 5 minutes?"
34406,Nadia, Tell me where she is
34407,Damon, The nicest thing that Katherine Pierce will ever do is feeding the maggots that feast on her flesh. Give it up. You're not getting her back
34408,Matt," Have you seen my phone? Ty! Have you seen my phone? I'm late for work, dude"
34409,Tyler," Look at you, captain responsible. Here. Join me for breakfast"
34410,Matt," No. You know, I'm good, seeing it's, uh, 7:42"
34411,Tyler," Aye, aye, Captain"
34412,Matt, Ok. So you gonna tell me what happened in New Orleans?
34413,Tyler," Well, there were witches, gumbo, a few originals. Look. It doesn't matter because it's over, in the past. No more drama. I'm starting fresh"
34414,Matt," Ok, then. We're celebrating. I'm throwing you a welcome back party"
34415,Tyler, Wait. What? No
34416,Matt," Yeah. So clean this place up and invite some people and, uh, shower because you stink"
34417,Caroline, It's open!
34418,Aaron, Are you cleaning the fireplace?
34419,Caroline," Yeah. Well, you know, all those carcinogens. Heh. I'm stress cleaning. I'm stressed, so I'm cleaning. Boy drama. Not that you care"
34420,Aaron," I'm here for Elena, but clearly she's not here. I'll… I'll come back later"
34421,Caroline," Well, I can give her a message"
34422,Aaron," Uh, yeah, can you just tell her that Wes isn't gonna be a problem anymore? I mean, my family's trust came through, and I was able to cut off Augustine's funding"
34423,Caroline, So no more vampire experiments?
34424,Aaron," Yeah, that's over. And can you just tell her that I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for everything?"
34425,Caroline, I will
34426,Enzo, Aaron Whitmore. Just the man I've been looking for
34427,Aaron, Enzo
34428,Stefan, Hey. I need a favor. You know how Damon was trying to be all noble and broke up with Elena?
34429,Caroline, Of course. There was champagne
34430,Stefan," Yeah. Well, I kind of convinced him he was an idiot"
34431,Caroline, You what?!
34432,Stefan," And now he's in a bit of a mood, and something tells me that he's been trying to get ahold of Elena, but she hasn't been returning his phone calls"
34433,Caroline," Look. I would love to help if I thought he was actually good for her, but I don't"
34434,Stefan," Caroline, how would you liked to be judged solely based on who you're attracted to? Come on"
34435,Caroline, Why? Do you know something?
34436,Stefan, Why? Should I know something?
34437,Caroline," I just mean are you sure that this is what you really want, you know, Elena and Damon or Damon and Elena, or… I know that there's a nickname in there somewhere"
34438,Stefan," Listen. I actually think that Elena is good for Damon. She makes him happy, and we all know that when Damon is happy..."
34439,Caroline," He's not out there k*ll people, which I guess is a plus for mankind"
34440,Stefan, Exactly
34441,Caroline," But even if I wanted to help, she's not here. I thought that she was with you"
34442,Stefan, She told me she was staying at Whitmore
34443,Caroline," Ok. That's weird. Well, where the hell is she?"
34444,Katherine/Elena, Does that thing ever shut up?
34445,Elena," Where am I? What's going on? Oh, my God. Katherine"
34446,Nadia," Hello, Elena"
34447,Elena, You! You put Katherine inside of me instead of you
34448,Elena/Katherine, What happened?
34449,Nadia, Elena Gilbert happened
34450,Elena/Katherine, Wonderful. She's fighting. It's only a matter of time before she comes out again. Did you get my body?
34451,Damon," Oh, come on. Katherine is exactly where she's always belonged. I'm not giving the body back. Quit giving me that damn pouty face"
34452,Stefan," I'm not giving you the pouty face. This is my ""you're being a dick"" face. Elena hasn't called you back. It's making you completely miserable"
34453,Damon," Yeah. I'm completely miserable. It's your fault, telling me to get her back"
34454,Stefan," No. You're miserable because you did what you always do. You had a problem, and instead of dealing with it, you cut ties and you ran"
34455,Damon, You're enjoying this a little too much
34456,Caroline," Ok. So Bonnie took Jeremy to go visit her mom, and neither of them have talked to Elena"
34457,Damon, Who invited you? Scram
34458,Stefan, I invited her. Caroline agreed to help you get Elena back
34459,Damon, You? You hate me. You once told me that calling me Satan was an insult to Satan
34460,Caroline, Well...Nobody's perfect
34461,Damon, This is what it's come to? You brought me love advice from prudy Trudy
34462,Caroline, I can be unpredictable and incredibly reckless
34463,Damon, What's going on here? Are you guys baby-sitting me?
34464,Stefan," We're just hanging out, chatting"
34465,Damon," I don't need this, and I don't need your help"
34466,Stefan," Well, I guess you better try Elena again"
34467,Katherine," Ugh. Seriously, I have never met a group of needier people. It's not bad enough that Damon's trying to win me back. I'm also getting ""where are you?"" ""I'm worried about you."" ""Call me."" ""Are you going to Tyler's party?"" It's a wonder that this thing still has a battery"
34468,Nadia, They're getting suspicious
34469,Katherine, Yeah
34470,Nadia, We need to find your body
34471,Katherine," Stefan texted and asked if I was going to Tyler's party. Maybe I do go, convince everyone that Elena is alive and well, and I casually ask him where Damon buried me"
34472,Nadia, No. No way. You said it yourself. It's just a matter of time until Elena shows up again
34473,Katherine, So then come with me. Shove her back in if that happens
34474,Nadia," This is not the right place for you to be, around all her friends"
34475,Katherine, I've impersonated Elena a million times. I can mimic everything about her
34476,Nadia, This is different. You're not impersonating Elena. You are Elena. When is her birthday? What grade did her and Caroline meet? Where did she kiss Stefan for the first time?
34477,Katherine," I'm gonna have to brush up on a few fun facts, and I know exactly who can help us"
34478,Tyler," You know, you still own my house"
34479,Matt," Yeah, legally. It's not like I pay the bills"
34480,Tyler," Yeah, but it means you'll have to invite certain people in tonight, people like Elena, Stefan…"
34481,Matt, Is that your lame way of asking if invited Caroline?
34482,Tyler, Pretty much
34483,Matt," Yeah, she's coming. So when you say you're starting over, you're basically saying you want Caroline back"
34484,Tyler," Just get the cups, ok?"
34485,Matt," Elena, hey"
34486,Katherine/Elena," Hi, Matty!"
34487,Matt, Matty?
34488,Katherine/Elena," Matt. I mean, Matt, I was, um, hoping that you could help me with something"
34489,Katherine/Elena, Guess who!
34490,Matt, Hmm. I wonder
34491,Damon, Enzo
34492,Enzo," Hello, Damon. Ahh. We have a bit of business to attend to"
34493,Damon, Missed a spot
34494,Enzo," Ooh! Oh. I love a good fire. Oh! That's ironic, isn't it, you know, since you left me to burn alive in one?"
34495,Damon," Didn't we already do this? You tried to make me feel guilty, I saved your life, we're even. What's in the bag?"
34496,Enzo," More like who. Ah. Since you and I last spoke, I've done a bit of soul-searching, had a trip to the barber, and did a little research, which revealed to me that you k*ll almost every member of the Whitmore family in the years since your escape, leaving just one alive each time to carry on the family name, producing a whole new generation of v*ctim for you to slaughter exactly as you said you'd do back when you and I were cellmates"
34497,Damon," Well, you know me .I like to keep my promises"
34498,Enzo," And it's occurred to me that perhaps I wrote you off too quickly, that, in fact, the Damon Salvatore I remember is alive and well, and I have a present for him"
34499,Damon, You brought me Aaron Whitmore... Alive
34500,Enzo," He's the last of the Whitmore clan. You remember this Vervain wristwatch? Dr. Whitmore never took it off, even when he was rooting around in our chest cavities. Fitting Aaron should die wearing it, too. So...Do you want to k*ll him, or shall I?"
34501,Katherine/Elena, Matt! Eh!
34502,Matt," Elena, hey. Come in"
34503,Katherine/Elena," Thank you. Well, that wasn't awkward at all"
34504,Matt, Right. Sorry about that
34505,Katherine/Elena, It's ok. Go find some blond to hit on
34506,Matt, All right. I'm gonna go make the rounds. You need anything?
34507,Katherine/Elena," I'm good, thanks"
34508,Stefan," Elena, you're alive"
34509,Katherine/Elena, Of course I'm alive. Wow! Stefan Salvatore is drinking beer out of a cup. Do you want me to show you where Tyler keeps the bourbon?
34510,Stefan, No. I'm trying to stay off the hard stuff. Hey. So... Where have you been? Caroline was about to send out a search party for you
34511,Katherine/Elena," Around, thinking, processing, trying to figure out how to deal with this whole Damon thing"
34512,Stefan," Hmm. You know he made a mistake, right? He wants you back"
34513,Katherine/Elena," Yeah, I know. Hang on. Isn't this a little weird for you?"
34514,Stefan," It's incredibly weird, but, uh, I know my brother, and I know he's a better person with you than without you"
34515,Katherine/Elena, So how are you? How are you dealing with the whole Katherine dying thing?
34516,Stefan, I’m ok
34517,Katherine/Elena," Stefan, you don't have to hide your feelings"
34518,Stefan," No. Honestly, I'm ok. You know, we had a thing, it ended, and she died, and I'm fine"
34519,Katherine/Elena," You knew her for, like, 150 years. You're not even a little heartbroken? I mean, even I feel a little bad. You know, maybe we should give her, like, a funeral or something"
34520,Stefan, A funeral?
34521,Katherine/Elena, Where's she buried? I should at least drop off flowers or something
34522,Stefan, I have no idea. Damon said he put her where she was always meant to be
34523,Katherine/Elena, Classic Damon
34524,Enzo," As much as I've enjoyed your quality bourbon, I feel confident our next drink will taste better with the sound of young Aaron's dying screams ringing in our ears and the knowledge that your final act of revenge will have brought us both closure and a new beginning"
34525,Damon, I'm just curious. Do you ask all of your friends to prove their loyalty by k*ll someone over drinks?
34526,Enzo, His grandfather slit our eyes open with a scalpel. You've taken out everyone else in the Whitmore family. I thought you'd want this
34527,Damon, Would you believe he's a friend of a friend?
34528,Enzo," No, because that would force me to believe that you've gone soft when you and I both know that your very first impulse when I presented him to you was to rip out his throat. Surely my old friend's still in there someplace. End this for both of us"
34529,Damon," Really bad timing, blondie. I'm dealing with a blast from the past"
34530,Caroline, Then deal with it quickly and get your ass over to Tyler's. Elena's here
34531,Enzo," Looks like he's coming round. It's time to make a decision, Damon. Do you want to k*ll him, or shall I?"
34532,Damon, I hate deadlines
34533,Aaron," Well, I didn't see that one coming"
34534,Damon, I can't k*ll you. Long story
34535,Aaron, Because Elena would hate you for it. That's why you can't k*ll me
34536,Damon, Go back to college and pack up your entire life. There's one highway that heads out of town. Take it north till you hit ice. Don't ever come back
34537,Nadia, How domestic of you
34538,Katherine/Elena, Apparently Elena would do this sort of stuff. I'm actually starting to feel sorry for her
34539,Nadia, Did you find out where your body is or not?
34540,Katherine/Elena, Stefan said Damon put me somewhere I was always meant to be
34541,Nadia, A riddle
34542,Katherine/Elena," For 145 years, Damon thought I was in a tomb underneath the old church, and, boy, was he $ disappointed when I wasn't there"
34543,Nadia," Well, let's hope you are this time"
34544,Katherine/Elena, Right
34545,Nadia, Now say your good-byes. We can't have anyone following us
34546,Caroline, There you are! I've been calling and texting
34547,Katherine/Elena," Sorry. My phone died. Um, what did you want to talk about?"
34548,Caroline, I did a bad thing
34549,Katherine/Elena, I'm sure it wasn't that bad
34550,Caroline," You don't even know what it is. Elena, stop. This is really important"
34551,Katherine/Elena, Ok. I'm sorry. Tell me. What happened?
34552,Caroline," What would you say if I told you that when a certain awful person was in town I ran into him in the woods and sort of kissed him? He was there, and he obviously wanted to kiss me, so I thought, ""oh! We'll just make out,"" but then it felt really good to kiss him, so then I kind of totally had sex with him, but I swear I didn't plan to do it, and now I feel terrible"
34553,Katherine/Elena, And the person we're talking about is...
34554,Caroline, Klaus
34555,Katherine/Elena," Oh, wow! That… that… wow! Really?"
34556,Caroline, Would I make something like this up? And that is why I need you to tell me what an awful person I am
34557,Katherine/Elena," Actually, you're one of the least awful people I know. So tell me. How was it, you know, compared to Tyler?"
34558,Caroline, Elena Gilbert!
34559,Katherine/Elena, Caroline Forbes! Come on. Spill the beans
34560,Caroline, I am...
34561,Katherine/Elena," Now that you've slept with Klaus, I mean, how was it?"
34562,Caroline, I am so not answering that
34563,Katherine/Elena," Oh, you so are.Oh, my God"
34564,Mia, Took you long enough
34565,Katherine/Elena, I was pretending to care. It was very time-consuming
34566,Nadia, Let's get it over with
34567,Mia," In order to seal Katherine's spirit inside Elena's body, I'll need some of your bl*od. Then…"
34568,Katherine/Elena, You mutilate my body. Lovely
34569,Mia," Travelers don't have access to traditional magic, so we improvise. Now shut up. I have to concentrate"
34570,Elena," So, um, what's happening now?"
34571,Mia," Katherine, if you want to say good-bye to Elena forever, I need silence"
34572,Nadia, Are you ok?
34573,Elena, Save your daughterly concern. I'm fine
34574,Tyler, Get out
34575,Caroline, Just let me explain
34576,Tyler," No. Let me. Klaus k*ll thousands of people… Elena's aunt, an entire pack of hybrids, my friends. Caroline... He k*ll my mom!"
34577,Caroline," I know, I know. I am so sorry"
34578,Tyler, Just stop. I walked out last time. Now it's your turn. Go
34579,Caroline, No
34580,Tyler," Don't take another step, Caroline"
34581,Caroline, If you would just…
34582,Tyler, I said leave!
34583,Stefan, You're drunk
34584,Tyler, Get your hands off me
34585,Stefan, What's the matter with you?
34586,Tyler," Oh, you don't know? She screwed Klaus. Exactly"
34587,Stefan," You know, drunk or not, she doesn't deserve that"
34588,Nadia, You never told me where you wanted to go
34589,Elena, Where I wanted to go?
34590,Nadia, Once we complete the spell. Where should we start our world tour?
34591,Mia," Let me finish. Just a few more seconds, and then I'm done"
34592,Nadia, Elena
34593,Elena, What was that? I couldn't quite hear you
34594,Damon," Donovan, you in here?"
34595,Nadia, Mia. Mia
34596,Mia, Are you ok?
34597,Nadia, Just finish the spell
34598,Elena," What? No. No, no, no. You've got to be kidding me. No, no, no. Katherine, get out of my head! No! No! Aah! Aah!"
34599,Elena," Damon! Damon, thank God"
34600,Damon, What's wrong?
34601,Mia, It's done
34602,Damon," Elena? Hey. Say something, please"
34603,Katherine/Elena, I've been looking everywhere for you. We need to talk
34604,Damon," Yeah, I want to talk, too. The message thingies on your phone, that's all me in case you deleted them and didn't listen to them"
34605,Katherine/Elena, I listened to every word
34606,Damon," Then you know how bad I screwed up. I wussed out, Elena. I bailed because I was convinced I'd ruin you"
34607,Katherine/Elena," That's not what this is about, Damon"
34608,Damon," No. I know. Just hear me out, just hear me out. You are literally the best person I've ever known, and for me to think that I could change you gives me way too much credit and you not nearly enough. You are the best influence on me. I need you. You are the good, and I need a little good in my life... Because without it, there's an awful lot of darkness"
34609,Katherine/Elena," That's a lot of pressure, Damon"
34610,Damon," I know, Elena"
34611,Katherine/Elena," No. No. It's my turn now. I love that I make you a better person, I love that I make you happy, but I don't want to be the only thing that you live for. I don't want to worry about what's gonna happen every time we get into a fight or if we break up again or who you're gonna take it out on"
34612,Damon, What… what are you talking about?
34613,Katherine/Elena," I know what you did to Katherine, Damon. She was weak and dying, and you still tortured her"
34614,Damon, How is this about Katherine?
34615,Katherine/Elena," It's not, ok? It's about you. It's about you, about the person that I can't change and the person that you really are. That person was right to let me go. I'm sorry, Damon, but it's over. We're over"
34616,Stefan, Damon
34617,Damon," Come on. Deep down, you got to be enjoying this a little bit"
34618,Matt, Hey
34619,Tyler," You know what I realized tonight? This is a big-ass house. I live in a fricking mansion. My parents are dead, the girl I love slept with my nemesis, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life, which… get this… lasts forever... But I got a big-ass house"
34620,Matt," Why don't we get out of it for a while, you know, just go somewhere, be anywhere but here?"
34621,Tyler," Klaus put me through hell in New Orleans, Matt. He crushed me, and just when I thought it was over, that he couldn't destroy anything else or do anything worse..."
34622,Nadia, So that's it? It worked?
34623,Mia," Try not to sound so impressed, but, yes, Katherine Pierce has permanent control of Elena Gilbert's body. Now about that payment we discussed"
34624,Nadia, Ugh. Was that necessary?
34625,Katherine," No, but she was a loose end, and I hate that"
34626,Nadia, She gave me the creeps anyway
34627,Katherine," Cold, manipulative, good hair. You really are my daughter"
34628,Nadia," If that's your way of thanking me, save it for the road"
34629,Katherine," I'm not going anywhere. For the first time in the last 500 years, I'm in the clear. There's no one coming after me. Hell, half the people in this town would probably slit their own throats to protect Elena Gilbert"
34630,Nadia, And what about me?
34631,Katherine," You're a grown woman. You can make your own decisions, but if you want my vote... Stay. Now I'm not saying that I'll ever learn how to be a good mother, but I'll try. I've got all the time in the world to get it right"
34632,Nadia," I've searched for you for centuries. I'm not leaving now, but we both know you want more than just mother-daughter bonding time"
34633,Katherine," You're right. I want it all. I want my daughter, I want immortality, and I want Stefan Salvatore. He's my one true love"
34634,Nadia, Well… I'd hate to be the person standing in your way
34635,Stefan, There you are. I've been looking all over for you
34636,Caroline," Yeah. Well, I couldn't find a rock big enough to crawl under, so... You're my friend. I need you to just give it to me straight. Am I a horrible person?"
34637,Stefan," So that's why you came here, huh? All right. Let me ask you something. When you found out about me and Katherine, what was your first thought?"
34638,Caroline," Honestly, I thought, ""eww”"
34639,Stefan," See? And if you held that against me, you wouldn't be sitting here right now with me, would you?"
34640,Caroline, Or maybe I came here because I know that you see the best in people
34641,Stefan," Ah. All right. Somebody has to say it, so here goes. You ready? Caroline... You are a horrible person, ok? You are… you are thoughtless, you're shallow, you're completely undependable…"
34642,Caroline, Ha ha ha! Hey! Hey. I am--I am vulnerable. Don't be mean
34643,Stefan," You know what? Now that I think about it, I have no idea what Klaus saw in you. What was he thinking?"
34644,Caroline, Ha ha ha! Shut up!
34645,Aaron," Hey. You all right? You all right, man?"
34646,Enzo," Never better. We've been waiting for you. Damon's teaching me a little game. See, he assured me you'd be on this road heading out of town"
34647,Aaron, You said that you were gonna let me go
34648,Damon, I did. I tried
34649,Aaron, Does Elena know that you're here?
34650,Damon, She's the reason I'm here. No. Scratch that. I'm the reason I'm here
34651,Aaron," What do you want, Damon?"
34652,Damon," I want the same thing you want, Aaron… go back in time, fix the past, get someone back I've lost"
34653,Aaron, Everyone that I lost is because of you. You know who m*rder my entire family? You!
34654,Enzo, Justifiably
34655,Damon," Either way, I did it. I tore them apart, I liked the sounds they made because I realized they deserved it like you"
34656,Aaron, Elena was too good for you
34657,Damon," I used to think that. Yeah. That I had to be better to deserve her love and she had to be worse to accept mine. I'd lie in the middle of the road, looking up at the stars, having conversations with people like you, trying to convince myself that k*ll them was a bad instinct and that sparing their lives was the right thing to do"
34658,Aaron, So what'd you do? Did you k*ll them?
34659,Damon," It doesn't matter. The point is I was conflicted. Right now in this very, very moment, I am crystal clear. See, Elena thinks I'm a monster. You know what? She's right"
34660,Enzo, Now that's the Damon Salvatore I remember
34661,Katherine," Dear diary, I love my life. Seriously, becoming Elena Gilbert is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I finally have everything I ever wanted. I'm young, healthy, gorgeous. Everyone loves me, but best of all, I'm a vampire again, so rest in peace, Elena. Thanks for giving me your perfect life, and now that I've corrected the single worst decision you ever made: falling in love with Damon Salvatore… I'm gonna win back the one thing I've always wanted. "
34662,Caroline, So we all agree? No more moping about life's little failures and no more dabbling in the dark arts of boyfriends past. This is a fresh start
34663,Katherine, Couldn't agree more. I happen to love fresh starts
34664,Bonnie," Um, I haven't been moping or dabbling"
34665,Caroline," No one likes a bragger, Bonnie"
34666,Bonnie, Hey. Do you mind if I share… Great. Thanks. Appreciate it
34667,Caroline," Today is the dawning of a new era. This is stage one in our metamorphosis into the land of the brave, the free, and the single"
34668,Katherine, Bonnie's not single
34669,Caroline," Bonnie's best friends are single, which makes her single adjacent. So she can be our wing woman"
34670,Katherine," ""Whitmore's annual bitter ball, a night to celebrate broken hearts, jilted lovers, and bitter singles.""This is our fresh start?"
34671,Caroline," No. This is our purge, our cleanse. This is where we rid ourselves from the baggage better known as our tragic and mortifying first semester"
34672,Katherine, I'll drink to that
34673,Caroline," Bonnie! Bonnie, you in?"
34674,Bonnie, Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like fun
34675,Damon," Hey. Sorry about the mess. I had some company, and things got a little out of hand"
34676,Stefan, You want to tell me what the hell's going on out in the driveway?
34677,Damon, Ah. I let Enzo drive last night. He is a little out of practice. Almost ended up in the damn foyer. Oh. You mean Aaron
34678,Stefan, Yeah
34679,Damon," Yeah. Well, last night, we hunted him down, and I ripped his throat out. Yeah. I just figured it's time to shove the last branch of the Whitmore family tree into the... wood chipper"
34680,Stefan," So Elena breaks up with you, and your first instinct is to go a k*ll spree? Could you be any more predictable?"
34681,Enzo, It was my idea if it makes you feel any better. Enzo. Remember? We met when…
34682,Stefan," When you were trying to tear Damon's head off. Yeah. I remember. So, what, you guys are old pals again, m*rder buddies, is that it?"
34683,Damon," Well, you know how it goes. I mean, I left him for dead, he tried to k*ll me, we worked things out. When you spend 5 years with someone in a dungeon, you have a pretty unbreakable bond"
34684,Enzo," Say, you haven't heard from Dr. Wes Maxfield by any chance? Bloke's next on the Augustine hit list, and he's a slippery little devil"
34685,Stefan," Is that the plan? k*ll off Augustine and then go back to your sadistic, psychotic old self?"
34686,Damon," I happen to like my old sadistic self, Stefan. In fact, I miss that guy. That guy was dumb enough to try and change himself to get a girl. Get another hobby, brother, because I'm not in the mood to be saved."
34687,Enzo, What do you say? Shall we get you a new hobby? Golf... Scrapbooking?
34688,Damon, Scrapbooking
34689,Stefan," Come on, Damon. You're better than this"
34690,Damon," On the contrary, brother. I'm better like this"
34691,Katherine," Hey, Stefan. Um, it's me. I was just, uh, wondering… I mean, I know things are kind of crazy and you're probably busy, but maybe you might want to come to campus and we can get a drink or, I don't know, talk"
34692,Matt, So you're trying to get back with Stefan?
34693,Katherine, I didn't ask you to editorialize. I asked you if that was something that Elena would say
34694,Matt," Yeah, I guess"
34695,Nadia, Walk away and forget this conversation. Are you happy? Can I leave now?
34696,Katherine," No. Stay close. Matt is my Elena Gilbert cheat sheet. Because I didn't know Bonnie's middle name, which is Sheila by the way"
34697,Nadia," You promised we would spend some time together. How long do you expect me to sit around the Mystic Grill like some sad, lonely bar fly?"
34698,Katherine," Oh, please. Don't pretend that baby-sitting Matty blue eyes is some sort of hardship. I mean, didn't you lure him into your bed in Prague?"
34699,Nadia," I didn't lure him, and I wasn't compelling him to forget everything. He's not a puppet"
34700,Katherine, Ah. Ok. I get it. You like him. That's adorable
34701,Nadia, Ok. I'm hanging up now
34702,Wes, Hello. How are you holding up?
34703,Man, What's going on? Who are you?
34704,Wes," My name is Dr. Wes Maxfield, and you're Joey, right? I saw your name stitched on your work shirt when I grabbed you. Apologies, but I never managed to make proper acquaintance of the janitorial staff before the hospital lost its funding. It's depressing, isn't it? The economy is no friend to medicine"
34705,Joey, What do you want from me? I don't have any money
34706,Wes," Ironically, Joey, neither do I"
34707,Joey, What did you do to me? Why am I so hungry?
34708,Wes," Well, in simple terms, I turned you into a vampire. Now I'm gonna condition you to feed on other vampires instead of humans"
34709,Joey, What? You're what?
34710,Wes, Would you believe that I've already done it once? Now all I have to do is replicate it. Research is just money and time. I've got time. I'll find money
34711,Woman, Perhaps I can help you with that
34712,Wes, Who the hell are you?
34713,Woman, I'm judging your crappy lab
34714,Wes, Still didn't catch your name
34715,Woman," Sloan, and I'm here to help you, so you can lose the arrogance. I'm here to offer you new funding for your research"
34716,Wes, What do you know about my research?
34717,Sloan," I've been tracking your Augustine experiments for months. So in return for money and protection, I have some bl*od I want you to analyze"
34718,Wes," Sorry, but I'm done getting into bed with mysterious benefactors, and I don't need your protection"
34719,Sloan, I beg to differ
34720,Wes, This is Aaron's bag. Where'd you get this?
34721,Sloan," I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Aaron Whitmore's car was found abandoned in the middle of the road last night"
34722,Wes, No…
34723,Sloan, No one has seen or heard from him
34724,Wes," He's dead, isn't he?"
34725,Sloan," My guess is, yes, he's dead, and more to the point, you're next"
34726,Enzo," So once we've finished off this Augustine mess, what do you say we do a road trip? I was thinking South America, Cape Horn. Sailed past but never stopped over"
34727,Damon, I'm not thinking that far ahead
34728,Damon," Rise and shine, Diane. How's our favorite head of Whitmore Security?"
34729,Enzo," Oh, that's ironic, isn't it, you know, since we broke in and kidnapped you from your office"
34730,Diane," Let me go, please. I have two kids"
34731,Enzo," A mother. Ah. Interesting. Well, then you can imagine how heartbreaking it would be to learn that your child committed su1c1de, especially when said child was actually m*rder by a vampire, a m*rder covered up by you"
34732,Diane, I didn't do any such thing
34733,Damon," Now, Diane, tell the truth. Did you cover up a vampire attack on campus by forging a su1c1de note or two?"
34734,Diane, Yes
34735,Enzo, Ah. Looks like the Vervain is officially out of her system
34736,Damon, Now I want you to tell me exactly where I can find Dr. Wes Maxfield
34737,Diane, I have no idea. I haven't heard from him in days
34738,Damon," Well, that's a shame, Diane, because that makes you a dead end"
34739,Enzo," Well, technically. Now she's a dead end"
34740,Damon, On to the next
34741,Stefan, I see Damon's got you on shallow grave duty
34742,Enzo, Be a mate. Grab a shovel
34743,Stefan, I'll pass. Buried enough skeletons out here
34744,Enzo, I'm sensing a metaphor
34745,Stefan," I think you need to find yourself a new best friend. Damon's in a bad place right now, and you're not really making things better. I know you just got out of captivity and you're looking to blow off a boatload of steam, which is fine. Just...do me a favor. Leave my brother out of it"
34746,Enzo, He mentioned you were a bit of a do-gooder
34747,Stefan, You know what makes somebody walk a straight line? When they have no choice but to be the balance for somebody who's about to fall off the edge
34748,Enzo," Ah, but it's so much more fun when you can just commit to the leap. You're welcome to join in on the fun. Looks like you could use it. Good man"
34749,Stefan," Why don't you be a mate, huh? Get in that car, start driving, don't look back"
34750,Enzo," You think that hurts? I'm curious, Stefan. What do you think you can possibly do to me that hasn't been done a hundred times before? Go on. Give it your best sh*t"
34751,Stefan," What I do to you, Enzo, will be final. Got it? Be sure I never see you again"
34752,Katherine, Good! You're back! I need your help. Diamond or dangler?
34753,Caroline, Since when does Elena Gilbert accessorize?
34754,Katherine, Since she's being conned to go to the bitter ball with her best friend Susie Sunshine
34755,Caroline, Look. You're not fooling anyone. I know that you're faking it
34756,Katherine, Faking? I'm what?
34757,Caroline," Please. It is so obvious. I appreciate it, I do, but you know I'm on edge because of the whole Tyler-Klaus thing, so you are pretending that breaking up with Damon was no big deal"
34758,Katherine," Caroline Forbes, how do you always see right through me?"
34759,Caroline," Look, Elena. You don't have to pretend with me, and if you don't want to go tonight, it's all good. I can be bitter, party of one"
34760,Katherine, Do you think Stefan would want to come?
34761,Katherine, I was… just about to call you
34762,Stefan," Hey. Listen. I need to talk to you, but I didn't want to do it over the phone"
34763,Katherine, What's wrong?
34764,Stefan, Let's just say it involves Enzo
34765,Katherine," Oh. Enzo. Uh...Ok. Then maybe we should meet in person. Actually, Caroline's dragging me to this Whitmore thing for lonely hearts. I think you should come"
34766,Stefan," Yeah. No, thanks. I already did the college thing. Twice actually"
34767,Katherine," Please. If it's bad, then I'll owe you a fun time"
34768,Tyler, Give me whatever will obliterate the memory of Caroline
34769,Matt, I thought you said you weren't drinking anymore
34770,Tyler, No. I said I wasn't drinking alone today
34771,Tyler, She's new
34772,Matt," Whatever you're thinking, unthink it. That's Katherine's daughter, and the psycho doesn't fall far from the tree"
34773,Nadia," I can hear you, you know?"
34774,Matt, You locked me in a safe and buried me alive
34775,Nadia," I'm sorry, but I was trying to save my mother's life, and I failed, so if you don't mind, I'd like to sit here and grieve in peace"
34776,Tyler, You want a sh*t? I want a sh*t. Let's do shots
34777,Matt, What?
34778,Tyler," Well, you heard her. She's sorry, her mom's dead. Let's do shots"
34779,Matt, It's your funeral
34780,Tyler," My mom was so afraid I'd flunk the eighth grade and embarrass her, she actually wrote an entire English paper for me"
34781,Nadia," Oh! Oh. My mother was so desperate for companionship, she compelled an entire town to be her friend"
34782,Matt, My mom hooked up with you
34783,Nadia," Oh, my God. Seriously?"
34784,Matt/Tyler, Afraid so
34785,Nadia," Drink, both of you"
34786,Tyler, Wow! Kind of forgot about that one. I have to pee
34787,Nadia, Hybrids pee?
34788,Matt, There's got to be a fire hydrant joke in there somewhere
34789,Tyler, Hilarious. Pour another round
34790,Nadia, Who's Enzo?
34791,Matt, I don't know. I've never met him
34792,Nadia, But you've heard of him
34793,Matt, He's Damon's buddy from Augustine. They were cellmates for 5 years. I think he's free or something
34794,Nadia, Thank you. Forget everything I've said since Tyler left
34795,Jeremy," So we're going to a dance, but we can't show up together because you can't bring a date?"
34796,Bonnie, Told you it was weird
34797,Jeremy, Better idea. Let's get another hotel room instead
34798,Bonnie, Caroline would k*ll me
34799,Jeremy," Bonnie, we're happy. Can't we just act like it?"
34800,Bonnie, You know what? You're right. I am happy
34801,Damon, It's like driving past a car crash except you want to look away
34802,Bonnie, What are you doing here?
34803,Damon," I tutor some kids in calculus. You know, I like giving back, be a good role model. Kidding! I'm here to kidnap your boyfriend"
34804,Jeremy, You're not funny. Let's get out of here
34805,Damon," You're not going anywhere, buddy"
34806,Bonnie, Let go of him
34807,Damon," Or what? You'll glare me to death?You don't have your little magic wand to back you up anymore, bon-bon"
34808,Jeremy, Hey. leave her alone
34809,Damon," Relax. I'm here for you, not her, you idiot. Keep up. Anyway, I have this hit list, and I can't find my last target, so basically, I need a witch"
34810,Bonnie," Ok. Well, you just said it. I can't do magic anymore, so go away"
34811,Damon, Grams ran occult studies. I'm sure we could throw a rock and hit a witch around here. So listen. Take this… this is Wes' bl*od. My buddy Enzo kept this as a souvenir. Now this should jump-start a locator spell. Ticktock
34812,Jeremy, Are you deaf? She is not helping you. You're not gonna hurt me. Elena would…
34813,Damon," Elena would what? Hurt me, dump me? Been there, done that, wrote the country song"
34814,Bonnie, k*ll you. She would k*ll you
34815,Damon, Cool. And then me and her all her doppelgangers could start a baseball team on the other side
34816,Enzo, What have I missed? She denied your request yet? Can we get on to the fun bit?
34817,Bonnie, Who the hell are you?
34818,Enzo, The one who gets people to do things they don't want to do
34819,Bonnie, Stop! Stop! Ok. Fine. I'll help!
34820,Katherine, Dead corsage?
34821,Caroline, Thank you
34822,Katherine, Hey! You made it
34823,Stefan, I did. So who thinks up these things?
34824,Katherine," Lonely single people. Come on. See? As promised, fun"
34825,Stefan, You seem good
34826,Katherine, I got the same reaction from Caroline like I'm not allowed to smile or something
34827,Stefan, Did I say that?
34828,Katherine," No, but I see your look"
34829,Stefan," Oh, I have a look?"
34830,Katherine, Yeah. That look. I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me. I'm great actually. I'm the only non-bitter person at this bitter ball
34831,Stefan," Hmm. Elena, listen. I need to talk to you about something. Damon… he got himself into some bad stuff"
34832,Katherine," Yeah. Well, it's what Damon does. If he gets the tiniest bit hurt, he lashes out. He doesn't think, he doesn't try… He just acts, and for the longest time, I tried to fix him. I'd try to change him, but I think he ended up changing me, and I'm not sure that I like the person that I've become. I mean, do you?"
34833,Stefan, Do I what?
34834,Katherine," Do you like who I am, or do you miss who I was?"
34835,Stefan," Elena, I…"
34836,Katherine, let's change the subject. What did you want to tell me? What did Enzo and Damon do now?
34837,Stefan, You know what? Could we talk about it later? Is that ok?
34838,Katherine, It's fine by me
34839,Stefan, Ok
34840,Caroline, Hey
34841,Stefan, Hey
34842,Caroline, Do you mind if I borrow her for a minute? She promised that she'd join me at the shredding station
34843,Stefan," Sure. Yeah, no. She's all yours"
34844,Caroline, Thanks!
34845,Katherine, Shredding station?
34846,Matt, Nadia's not compelling me
34847,Tyler, Really? Where the hell's your Vervain?
34848,Matt, Right here
34849,Tyler, You see? She swiped it and probably compelled you not to notice
34850,Matt, Why would Nadia be compelling me?
34851,Tyler, I have no idea. Is there any Vervain here?
34852,Matt, Yeah. Sheriff Forbes makes me put it in the coffee
34853,Tyler, Drink some now
34854,Caroline, Did you bring anything to shred?
34855,Katherine, No because I didn't realize people still printed photos. Ok. Do you feel cleansed?
34856,Caroline, Almost
34857,Katherine, Tyler drew you a horse?
34858,Caroline, No. Klaus did
34859,Katherine, Wow. Clean sweep
34860,Caroline, Yes. I am making a decision. These relationships are over. Over.I'm not going to change my mind just because I'm feeling bored or nostalgic or lonely
34861,Katherine, Wait. Are you doing that thing where you're talking about yourself but really you're talking about me?
34862,Caroline," I'm just saying that you've been through a lot lately, and your emotions are all over the place. So are Stefan's. I think that making yourself so available could maybe be confusing things"
34863,Katherine, Do you think that I'm leading him on?
34864,Caroline, No. I didn't say that. I just… I…ugh. Just forget it. Just… just forget everything I said
34865,Katherine, Ok
34866,Damon," Makes me so happy I'm not 19 and stupid. All right, Bonnie.Where's your little witch friend?"
34867,Bonnie," Liv Parker. She's in one of my classes, and she's not my friend. I looked her up, found out she works events catering. This is a total sh*t in the dark"
34868,Damon," Well, I'm feeling lucky"
34869,Caroline, Come on. Come be bitter with me
34870,Stefan," Oh, no, no, no. You are the second person that I didn't come here to dance with"
34871,Caroline, Ok. Then what are you not telling Elena?
34872,Stefan," Way to eavesdrop, Caroline"
34873,Caroline, You came to a dance of your own free will. Something is up
34874,Stefan, Ok. Fine. Damon fell off the deep end
34875,Caroline," Uh, what do you mean exactly by deep end?"
34876,Stefan," For starters, he k*ll Elena's friend Aaron"
34877,Caroline, He… what?
34878,Stefan," Yeah, and I came here to tell her, but we were dancing, and she seemed so happy, and I just couldn't"
34879,Caroline, You think if you tell her what he did that she'll give up on him forever?
34880,Stefan," Yeah. I know she will, and I don't think I'll be able to pull Damon back from that. I mean, I've seen Damon at his worst, Caroline, and I actually think he enjoys the way it makes him feel. It's like the more pain he can cause; the more reasons there are for people to hate him. He wants to confirm everyone's lowest expectations of him, and I just honestly don't know how to fight that side of him"
34881,Damon," Why all the dramatics, brother?"
34882,Stefan, What are you doing here? 
34883,Caroline," Bonnie, what's going on?"
34884,Damon," Oh, don't worry. I'm not her date. We're not gonna break any bitter ball rules"
34885,Stefan, How about you just answer the damn question?
34886,Damon," Well, Bonnie is gonna find me a witch to do a locator spell on the elusive Dr. Wes Maxfield. She's gonna find him, I'm gonna k*ll him. Bon-bon, should I tell them?"
34887,Bonnie," Enzo has Jeremy. If I don't get a witch to find Wes by midnight, he'll k*ll him"
34888,Katherine," If Jeremy Gilbert's life was hanging by a thread, could I credibly just let him die?Because his death would be really convenient for me"
34889,Nadia, Are you seriously making a pros and cons list?
34890,Katherine, Are there any cons? Because I've only listed pros
34891,Nadia, Katherine!
34892,Katherine, I'm just saying his death would earn me a lot of tenderness and sympathy from Stefan
34893,Nadia," If Jeremy is in danger, Elena would do everything in her power to save his life. You know that"
34894,Katherine," But Stefan is here. We were dancing. It was good, and I think he was even flirting with me, which is very naughty, even for him"
34895,Nadia," Listen. If you don't start acting like you care, they will figure out you're not Elena"
34896,Katherine," So if I happen to know exactly where he is, I'm supposed to go and put my life in danger to save that little rug rat's life?"
34897,Nadia, Do you know where he is?
34898,Katherine, He's at that hideous Whitmore house. I recognize it from the picture. Apparently I'm the only one who's been to a Whitmore tea party
34899,Nadia, Save him now!
34900,Katherine," Ok. Fine, but in the meantime, I'm gonna need you to find out from Matt if Caroline has feelings for Stefan because she's really starting to grate. I need to know what I'm up against"
34901,Matt, Who keeps calling you?
34902,Nadia, Does Caroline have feelings for Stefan?
34903,Matt, Caroline? I have no idea
34904,Nadia, Think. Has Elena ever been worried Caroline might steal Stefan away? Have they ever fought about him?
34905,Matt, Not that I know of
34906,Nadia, So you think Elena can win Stefan back?
34907,Matt, Why are you asking me about Elena?
34908,Nadia, Forget we had this conversation
34909,Tyler, So was I right?
34910,Matt," Ty, you're not gonna believe what I'm about to tell you"
34911,Nadia, You're not going to tell him anything
34912,Stefan, You ok?
34913,Katherine," I just can't lose Jeremy again. Stefan, please. Help me save him"
34914,Liv, This room's off limits
34915,Bonnie," Look. Under normal circumstances, I'd probably try to warm up to you, be your friend or something, but I'm kind of under a time crunch, and I need your help"
34916,Liv, Am I supposed to know you?
34917,Bonnie," We're in sociology together. I'm Bonnie. My grams Sheila Bennett used to teach here, occult studies"
34918,Liv," Never heard of it or her, so..."
34919,Bonnie, I know you're a witch. I saw you spin that pen this morning
34920,Liv, I have no idea what you're talking about
34921,Bonnie," You don't have to be scared. I used to be one, too"
34922,Liv, Yeah. No. Try the campus coven club or something
34923,Bonnie, I really need your help
34924,Liv," Even if I wanted to help, I couldn't. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just some freak, ok? Now leave me alone"
34925,Liv," Oh, my God! What the hell are you?"
34926,Caroline, You're gonna help my friend. Do I need to say it slower?
34927,Liv," Vampires are real. Ok. That makes sense. Actually, that makes no sense"
34928,Bonnie," Concentrate. Forget about the vampires. Focus on tapping into your power, listen to the sound of your heart b*at, the sound of your lungs filling with air"
34929,Damon, How long's this gonna take?
34930,Caroline, For a newbie witch to learn a complicated spell under massive stress? I have no idea. Bonnie?
34931,Bonnie," Repeat after me. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem"
34932,Liv, Wait. What?
34933,Bonnie, Just relax. Now keep your eyes closed and use the bl*od to find Wes
34934,Liv, I have no idea what he looks like
34935,Bonnie, You don't have to
34936,Damon, That a good sign?
34937,Liv, I can't do this
34938,Bonnie, Just concentrate. Try again
34939,Liv," I can't do this. Don't you get it? I've done horrible things. I've set buildings on fire, I've hurt people. I can't control any of it"
34940,Damon, Witchy hotline. How my I help you? Damon speaking
34941,Enzo, What's taking so long?
34942,Damon, They seem to have lost motivation. Maybe you can inspire them
34943,Enzo, Heh. With pleasure. Let them know Jeremy will be dead very soon
34944,Damon, Thank you
34945,Bonnie," What are you doing? Damon, call him back right now and you tell him to stop. Damon, call him back!"
34946,Damon," Just so you know, cooperation’s not optional"
34947,Enzo, Damon tells me your sweetheart hasn't come through on your behalf
34948,Jeremy, What are you gonna do? I'm sure k*ll me would really inspire her
34949,Enzo," Heh. You know, you're right. She'll think I'm just some cliché m*rder. I really like to make a good impression, you know?"
34950,Jeremy, You don't have to do this
34951,Enzo," You see, that's the thing about threats. If there's no follow-through, no one takes you seriously. Sorry to make this about me. See? Wasn't so bad"
34952,Bonnie," I've done bad things, too, ok? I've broken windows; I've set more fires than I can count"
34953,Liv, Is that supposed to make me feel better?
34954,Bonnie, I'm saying I learned how to control it. I can teach you the same thing. This is Jeremy
34955,Liv, He's cute
34956,Bonnie," Yeah, he is, and his life is literally in your hands"
34957,Liv," Ok. But if I go all Carrie and burn the school down, it's on you"
34958,Bonnie, Ok
34959,Katherine," Jeremy! Damn it, Jeremy!"
34960,Stefan, You should have left when I told you to
34961,Enzo, Did I give the impression I was taking orders from you? My bad
34962,Katherine," Come on! Come on! Wake up, Jeremy"
34963,Katherine," Ugh. Thank God. Stefan, help me!"
34964,Enzo, You missed all the fun
34965,Damon, Spell worked. Wes is in Richmond
34966,Enzo, Brilliant. I'll drive
34967,Stefan, Damon... Don't bother coming back
34968,Damon, I wasn't planning on it
34969,Tyler, What happened? Where's Nadia?
34970,Matt, Sorry. Slight misunderstanding
34971,Tyler, She snapped my neck. What the hell kind of misunderstanding is that?
34972,Matt, You were right. She was compelling me but only because she wanted to talk about Katherine and she knew I was pissed at her. I guess they didn't really settle their mother-daughter issues before she died
34973,Tyler, She wanted to talk about Katherine?
34974,Matt," Yeah, but she knew that you would go after her if you knew she was frying my mind. I guess she's got that whole stone-cold survival thing going. Like mother, like daughter"
34975,Tyler, A little friendly advice. Stay the hell away from her
34976,Matt, Yep. I plan on it
34977,Tyler, You call me if she gives you any more hassle
34978,Matt, I took care of it
34979,Nadia," If he follows us, I'll k*ll you both"
34980,Matt," I said I took care of it. Earlier on the phone, you weren't talking to Elena. You were talking to someone who needed information"
34981,Nadia, Do yourself a favor and stop asking questions
34982,Matt," Your boyfriend once planted himself inside my brain. That's how you were planning on saving Katherine. She didn't die, did she? She jumped inside Elena"
34983,Nadia, The only thing easier than breaking your neck is taking off your magic life ring. Do you understand?
34984,Matt, Yeah. What are you gonna do with me?
34985,Nadia," I haven't decided yet. First, we need to get the Vervain out of your system, and then, we'll see"
34986,Enzo," So what do you say? Paper, scissors, stone for who gets to give Dr. Frankenstein his fatal blow"
34987,Damon, Nah. He's all yours
34988,Enzo, Now don't tell me you're having second thoughts about leaving home
34989,Damon, I was there for Elena. We're done. No reason to go back
34990,Enzo, What about your brother?
34991,Damon," You saw his face. I know that look. He's done with me, too"
34992,Damon, And you are?
34993,Wes, My backup
34994,Damon, You got to be kidding me
34995,Enzo, What is this? Agh! More witches?
34996,Damon, Close. Travelers
34997,Wes," Good luck making new friends, Damon"
34998,Stefan, You ok?
34999,Katherine," Oh. Um, you know, actually, would you mind? I think I still have a splinter in my back"
35000,Stefan, Yeah. Sure. Yeah. There it is. Try not to move
35001,Katherine," Sorry. I think I know what you wanted to tell me tonight, Stefan"
35002,Stefan, Got it
35003,Katherine," Damon k*ll Aaron, didn't he? You walked right through the threshold at the Whitmore house. You couldn't have done that if the owner hadn't been dead. Aaron was the owner"
35004,Stefan, Yeah. I… I should have told you. Sorry
35005,Katherine," Why didn't you? I thought that we... Maybe I don't deserve anything from you, but I thought we could be honest with each other no matter what"
35006,Stefan, You want me to be honest?
35007,Katherine, Yes
35008,Stefan," All right. Truth is, ever since the first time I noticed you falling for my brother, I have been waiting for him to screw something up so badly that you would hate him, so I've been waiting and watching him do all these horrible things, and then every single time I think that he's gone too far, he's there for you, sometimes in ways better than I ever was. So the truth is after a while, I just stopped waiting for him to fail because I liked the person that he had become... And I don't want to lose that person"
35009,Katherine," He threatened my brother. Stefan, I can't go back to that"
35010,Stefan, I know
35011,Katherine," But if you want to save him from himself, then I'll help you but not for myself and not for him. For you"
35012,Enzo, What… what'd he stick you with?
35013,Damon, I don't know
35014,Enzo, Come here
35015,Damon," I can tell you, if he stuck me with that cannibal vampire poison, we might have a little problem"
35016,Enzo, What kind of problem?
35017,Damon, Wes has this sick little scheme to destroy vampires by making them feed on each other. You hear that?
35018,Joey, Can you get me out of here? I don't want to be here. I need to get out. Thanks. I owe you. What's happening to you?
35019,Damon, I'm gonna go ahead and say karma. Karma's happening to me
35020,Enzo," Damon? Damon, stop! Ok, I can see how this might be a problem"
35021,Enzo, You think the fella loved milking cows?
35022,Damon," Probably. Then she became one, so he drank himself into oblivion, she cheated with the pastor"
35023,Enzo, Hey. Just because you lost your true love doesn't mean you have to dump on others
35024,Damon," There's no love in there. Look at that picture. It's old, and the milkmaid's nowhere to be found. It's just pathetic old farmer John"
35025,Enzo, Manners. It's impolite to speak ill of our hosts
35026,Damon, Doubt he'll mind
35027,Enzo," Somebody's cranky. It's been almost 8 hours since you last fed, so I suppose that's about right"
35028,Damon, You're timing me?
35029,Enzo, You feed on vampires now. I am a vampire. The only way to assure my safety is to know how long you can last before your next fix
35030,Damon, Or you can just leave
35031,Enzo," I don't abandon my friends, Damon. Besides, if you hadn't come with me to k*ll Dr. Wes, he wouldn't have stuck you with that nasty virus"
35032,Enzo, Ah! Just in time. Hello!
35033,Man, What did you do? What's happening?
35034,Enzo," Uh, you died, but luckily, you had my bl*od in your system, so when you drink this,you'll feel much better. There you are"
35035,Damon, Good boy
35036,Man, What was that?
35037,Enzo, That was bl*od. You're a vampire. Congratulations
35038,Man, I'm a what?
35039,Enzo," I know. It's overwhelming, and Damon will explain more in a bit,but before he does, settle a bet. Your wife. Where is she?"
35040,Man, Wait. I drink bl*od now?
35041,Enzo," Again, we'll explain everything. Where's your wife?"
35042,Man, She's gone. She left me years ago
35043,Damon, Pastor? Pastor?
35044,Man, Pharmacist
35045,Damon," Yes. I will take that as a win for me, not for you"
35046,Enzo," Oh, stop trying to scare me, Damon. I'm not leaving you. I'm the only friend you have left"
35047,Stefan, Roman Empire
35048,Katherine, 76 A.D. sacked by the Goths
35049,Stefan, Han Dynasty
35050,Katherine, 220 A.D
35051,Stefan, Holy Roman Empire
35052,Katherine," Not really an empire, but 1648"
35053,Stefan, There goes your perfect score
35054,Katherine, What? No. That was right
35055,Stefan," No, no, no. The book says 1806"
35056,Katherine," Heh. Ok. Well, 1806 may technically be right, but it was the Peace of Westphalia that truly ended the empire. Trust me. I may have done a paper on the Holy Roman Empire in high school"
35057,Stefan," Well, if you want to pass the test, I suggest you write down exactly what's in your textbook.Oh. Caroline's here. I asked the sheriff to help me track down Damon"
35058,Caroline, You were right. He's off the rails. This is from my mom
35059,Stefan, Let me guess… missing persons and animal attacks
35060,Caroline," Check and check. There's something else. All the v*ctim were found inside their homes without their head, and there skin was desiccated"
35061,Stefan, Damon's feeding on vampires. I shouldn't have let him go
35062,Caroline, No! Uh-uh. No! You are not turning Damon's roosting chickens into a Stefan Salvatore guilt trip. No one could have stopped him from going after Wes the other night
35063,Stefan, Guess Wes must have injected him with whatever he was gonna give Elena that makes vampires feed on vampires
35064,Caroline," Good news, bad news. Bad news is that when this happened to Jesse we had to k*ll him, but the good news is... I'm sorry. Usually there's some good news"
35065,Stefan, I have to find him
35066,Katherine," Well, I can come with you"
35067,Caroline," Elena, hey! I didn't know that you were here"
35068,Katherine," Well, Stefan has been helping me study"
35069,Caroline, Oh. Stefan who doesn't go to college
35070,Katherine, Stefan who's an expert in history
35071,Caroline," Uh-huh. Um... It's Tyler. I haven't really spoken to him since, the, um, incident"
35072,Stefan, The incident? You mean the time where he almost k*ll you?
35073,Caroline, Hey
35074,Tyler," Hey, have you talked to Matt?"
35075,Caroline, No. Why?
35076,Tyler," Because it turns out Nadia's been compelling him to forget things. Matt said he was gonna avoid her, but now I haven't heard from him"
35077,Caroline, Do you think that he's in trouble?
35078,Tyler," He hasn't been home or at work, and his cell phone goes straight to voicemail"
35079,Caroline," Ok. Well, I'll come right over and…"
35080,Tyler, No. That's not why I called
35081,Caroline," No. I know, but I think that we can figure this out together. I'll see you soon"
35082,Katherine, Maybe I should come with you
35083,Caroline," No. No. You deal with Damon. We can handle this. Besides, it's time that we move into the next phase of our post-breakup, pre-friendship relationship timeline"
35084,Katherine," Ok. I'm gonna stay out that one. I'm gonna get some clothes, and you'll pick me up at my dorm?"
35085,Stefan, Sure
35086,Stefan," Bad news is Tyler hates you, but the good news is...hmm"
35087,Caroline, It'll be fine. We both have weird ex...friend situations
35088,Stefan, We? There's nothing weird going on between Elena and me
35089,Caroline," Come on, Stefan! First she tells you that she's gonna fight to get Damon back,and then she rebreaks up with him, and now she's here with you, her ex, studying?"
35090,Stefan, She's here with her friend studying without the implied quotes
35091,Caroline," Look. I'm just saying that Elena and Damon's breakup is messy,and you are not messy.You're stable and sane and…"
35092,Stefan," and I'm about to spend 12 hours in a car with her alone, so whatever she's feeling I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out"
35093,Katherine, What's going on with Matt?
35094,Nadia, Nothing
35095,Katherine, Really? Because goldilocks and the big bad wolf are meeting to powwow about him as we speak
35096,Nadia, Fine. Matt found out about you
35097,Katherine, He what?!
35098,Nadia, Tyler gave him Vervain
35099,Katherine, k*ll him
35100,Nadia, Katherine!
35101,Katherine, k*ll him now
35102,Nadia," He doesn't need to die. The Vervain will be out of his system soon, and I've kept him out of sight for two days, so he hasn't told anyone"
35103,Katherine," So you two have just been tucked away, canoodling?"
35104,Nadia, I don't even know what that means
35105,Katherine," We all love Matt Donovan. Otherwise, he would have been dead a long time ago, but when it comes to keeping my new doppelganger body a secret, nobody is that important. I am going out of town with Stefan because he wants to find Damon"
35106,Nadia, I thought you wanted Damon out of the picture
35107,Katherine," Meh. I do, but I saw an opportunity to be alone with Stefan for a few days, and, well, I took it"
35108,Nadia," And what happens when you get too close, too comfortable? What happens when you slip up? Will you k*ll your precious Stefan, too?"
35109,Katherine," Using my own words against me. Now that's a Petrova specialty. Take care of the Matt issue before I get back into town, or I'll have to do it myself"
35110,Matt, It'll be fine. I just need to convince my friends that I'm ok. I'll keep your secret. No one has to die
35111,Nadia, Relax. I'm not going to syrup you to death. What's canoodling?
35112,Enzo, I didn't realize you liked to play with dolls
35113,Damon," Well, my brother likes to make a big show, set them up, put their heads back on, pretend like it didn't happen. I, on the other hand, don't give a crap"
35114,Enzo," Well, we've got 8 hours till you need to feed again. I wonder, what's New York like these days"
35115,Damon, Crowded
35116,Enzo," Perfect. Let's go. Oh, what is that?"
35117,Damon, It's the obnoxious theme song of the Travelers
35118,Wes," As a man of science, I always considered magic a cheat. Turns out I cheat. How's the appetite?"
35119,Damon, Funny you should ask. I was just craving a blond
35120,Wes," You're my patient zero, Damon. I couldn't let you ride off into the sunset without running a few tests"
35121,Enzo, A few tests
35122,Wes," Well, one test. Now that you're trapped with only one source of food, how long can you go before you feed on your best friend?"
35123,Katherine, You ever think about getting a new car?
35124,Stefan, What are you talking about? This car's a classic
35125,Katherine," Yeah, and so is, uh, Wright brothers' plane, but you don't see people still flying around in that thing"
35126,Stefan," You know, uh... I appreciate you being here, but you didn't have to come"
35127,Katherine, I told you I'm doing this for you because you're still holding on to the hope that maybe this is the time that Damon can be saved
35128,Stefan," And you don't think he can? Look. I know that he crossed a line with Jeremy, but, you know, he's crossed many lines before"
35129,Katherine," You mean, when he actually k*ll Jeremy? Yes, I recall"
35130,Stefan, I'm just saying you've never really closed him off like this before
35131,Katherine," I mean, obviously, I still care about Damon. I guess I got my hopes up too many times I want off the emotional roller coaster that is Damon's redemption. You know, it's just… it's dizzying. Are you hungry? Because I'm starving"
35132,Stefan," Um, sure. What do you want?"
35133,Katherine, Whatever you're having but with a lot more salt and maybe covered in chocolate
35134,Stefan, Coming right up
35135,Enzo," Give it up, mate. Those Travelers sealed this whole place up tight"
35136,Damon, The spell can't last forever
35137,Enzo," Doesn't need to. Wes only needs it to last 8 hours, remember? Then he can come back inside and autopsy my mangled corpse"
35138,Damon, You're pretty Zen about all this
35139,Enzo, Did you forget everything I taught you in that cell? Calmer heads will always prevail
35140,Damon, Always the solider
35141,Enzo," But you do have people we can call, like your brother or your ex, who can in turn find Wes and threaten him or maim him or anything that doesn't involve your fangs on my neck"
35142,Damon, My brother told me to leave and not come back. I'm not calling him
35143,Enzo, So my life is not worth your pride?
35144,Damon, They won't come
35145,Enzo," Or they will. Then you might hurt them. Don't want to risk, do you? Me on the other hand..."
35146,Damon, I'm not gonna feed on you
35147,Enzo, I'll find another way
35148,Caroline, Thank you. Mmm. That's good coffee. Although I usually take mine with a little more awkward silence
35149,Tyler," Nice try, but you don't take anything with silence"
35150,Caroline, So Matt.He's missing?
35151,Tyler," I don't know if he's missing. He just hasn't been home in two days, and he's not answering his phone"
35152,Caroline, Matt?
35153,Matt, Caroline! What are you doing here?
35154,Caroline,
35155,Nadia, Did I give you my sunglasses? Oh. Hello. I thought you said they wouldn't be home
35156,Caroline, Ok. Rewind. Start over. This whole time you've been with Nadia?
35157,Matt," It's a long story. Nadia, come on in"
35158,Stefan, Hey. Can you hold this for a second?
35159,Katherine, Yeah
35160,Stefan, Careful. It has grease on it
35161,Katherine," Oh, ok"
35162,Stefan," I have no idea how this hose ripped out, but we're not gonna be able to go anywhere until I get a new one. I guess I'll see if that mechanic has a spare. You weren't careful at all?"
35163,Katherine, What? What? Ohh! I love this shirt
35164,Stefan, You loved that shirt
35165,Katherine, Great. Awesome that's just awesome
35166,Stefan, Now there's grease all over your face
35167,Katherine," Well, you've got all that engine stuff on you, and I clearly have to change. I saw a hotel, like, a couple streets down that way. Do you think we should get a room so that we can shower while we're waiting for the car?"
35168,Stefan," No. I should probably stay here in case they finish early, but you can go"
35169,Katherine," Give them your phone number. I assume that your phone does receive incoming calls, right? Or is it from the Han Dynasty just like your car?"
35170,Stefan, That's funny
35171,Katherine, Will you grab my bag?
35172,Stefan, Sure. Be right there
35173,Matt," I was on my way out of town, and then there she was, sitting on the front steps, waiting for me"
35174,Nadia," Subtlety's not my strong suit. I felt bad about compelling him and bad about snapping your neck. Again, subtlety"
35175,Tyler, So why haven't you been answering your phone?
35176,Matt," Uh, I lost it the first night"
35177,Caroline, First night where?
35178,Nadia," Atlantic City.I'd never been, neither had Matt"
35179,Matt," 1 drink led to 3 and to 5 and then, uh... The rest is kind of a blur"
35180,Caroline," Yeah, because she's compelling you!"
35181,Matt," Caroline, I'm wearing Vervain. She's not compelling me"
35182,Caroline, Where have you been the last two days?
35183,Matt, I told you. She's not compelling me. We're having fun
35184,Caroline, Oh. Fun! Just like the time she buried you alive! Whoo! Pop open the champagne!
35185,Nadia, I thought you said she'd be cool with us hanging out
35186,Caroline, And what the hell is that supposed to mean?
35187,Nadia," It means you've done nothing but judge Matt since he walked through that door when everyone here knows you're not exactly winning friends with your romantic choices. Isn't that right, Tyler?"
35188,Tyler, I don't want to be a part of this
35189,Caroline, She's just trying to get under our skin to distract us
35190,Tyler, From what? This is Matt we're talking about. Did you forget that time he went to Europe with Rebekah after she ran his truck off the road?
35191,Caroline, You're not seriously buying all this?
35192,Tyler, Hell of a lot easier to buy than other things that have happened
35193,Stefan," So what did you do, bring your entire closet?"
35194,Katherine," Well, I didn't know how long we'd be gone, and let's be honest. Damon's spirals require a little more than an overnight bag"
35195,Stefan," We'll get him back. He's, uh… he's hurt, but he's not a lost cause"
35196,Katherine, What makes you think that?
35197,Stefan, Because I know what he's going through
35198,Katherine, What do you mean?
35199,Stefan," You don't know what it's like being in love with you. You know, when you and I were together, every single atom in my body told me that it was the right thing, that we were the perfect fit, and that kind of love, it can change your whole life, and then when somebody who made you feel that way suddenly stops, the vacuum is just..."
35200,Katherine, I get it. They built a whole prophecy around it
35201,Stefan," He's not handling it right, but he's not gone"
35202,Katherine, You need a refill
35203,Stefan, I should go wash up
35204,Enzo," Towing chains. Farmer's best friend and in about an hour, mine. Take a seat"
35205,Damon, They're not gonna let us out of here until I k*ll you... Or you k*ll me
35206,Enzo, Don't be dramatic. We'll work something out
35207,Damon," There's no cure, Enzo, not for this"
35208,Enzo," You've given it all of two days. That's what you do, isn't it? There's a problem, you run. You did it to me, you did it to your girl"
35209,Damon," Because when I stay, I destroy things"
35210,Enzo, We're not all as fragile as you think we are
35211,Damon, What the hell are you doing?
35212,Enzo, Calling for backup
35213,Damon, I thought I told you not call them
35214,Enzo, And I told you your pride isn't worth either of our lives
35215,Katherine," Oh, my God. Damon?"
35216,Enzo," Hello, Stefan. How wonderful to hear your beautiful feminine voice"
35217,Katherine, Enzo. What the hell do you want?
35218,Enzo, I'm in a spot of trouble actually
35219,Katherine, Where's Damon?
35220,Enzo," Oh, he's here, salivating, about to chomp into my neck and feed until my head pops off in a grotesque but slightly comical fashion"
35221,Katherine, Wes infected him?
35222,Enzo, You know about the virus. Good. We could use a hand. Wes enlisted some of those singing witches and trapped us in the house
35223,Damon, Do not come here!
35224,Enzo," He doesn't want to risk feeding on you. That's sweet really, but you'll be fine. Besides if he does feed on you, I have orders to k*ll him"
35225,Katherine," Ok. Um, text me the address to my phone, and we'll be there as soon as we can"
35226,Enzo," Fine. And, uh, ticktock. I managed to restrain him, but you know how persistent Damon can be when he wants something"
35227,Katherine, We'll be there soon
35228,Stefan, You say something?
35229,Katherine, No
35230,Enzo," It'll be all right, mate. They'll come, and we'll sort something out"
35231,Damon," Or they'll come, and I'll feed on them"
35232,Enzo," Those are also options. As long as I live, I'm good. Joking. Kind of"
35233,Enzo," If you were aiming for my heart, you missed"
35234,Wes, Don't worry. I wasn't. Chains were a good idea. Now I can see exactly how strong he becomes when enraged. Conclusion… very strong
35235,Enzo," Boy, do I miss that indestructible Augustine cage right about now. Damon, stop! Damon, stop! Stop! Please, Damon, stop!Damon, stop! Stop, please! Damon! Aah! Aah! What did you do to him?"
35236,Wes," My friends here raised the acidity of your bl*od. There must be some witchy explanation for it, but Damon's basically drinking hydrochloric acid. I suggest you leave before the spell wears off"
35237,Enzo, And go where… with you?
35238,Wes, There's one more thing I need from you. Then I'll let you go for good. The other option is to stay in here with your cannibal friend and see how long you last
35239,Damon," Go, Enzo!I tried to k*ll you. I'll do it again. Go, Enzo!"
35240,Stefan, Car's done
35241,Katherine," I'll be right there. Hey, um... Would mind grabbing me my shirt? It's the… the green one right on top"
35242,Stefan," Yeah, sure"
35243,Katherine, Thanks
35244,Stefan," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is... This wrong. We, uh... You and Damon just split up"
35245,Katherine," You don't have to, um… you're right. I'm… I'm sorry. I was just in the moment. I shouldn't have"
35246,Stefan," Yeah. We have a long night ahead of us, so maybe we should…"
35247,Katherine," Yeah. Um, you know what? Why don't you go, um, settle up the bill, and I'll… I'll finish packing?"
35248,Katherine," Who do you think Stefan loves more, Damon or Elena?"
35249,Nadia, Why are you calling me?
35250,Katherine," Damon has been infected by the ripper virus, and I know exactly where he is, so if I can get Damon to attack me, the only way to save me would be for Stefan to k*ll him"
35251,Nadia," You're going to make Stefan k*ll his brother?Dark, even for you"
35252,Katherine, Thank you. So how goes it with Matty blue eyes? Dead yet?
35253,Nadia, Still working on it. Good luck with your plan to win Stefan's love
35254,Matt, So...I'm curious. We spent a few days together now
35255,Nadia, Canoodling?
35256,Matt," Canoodling. Exactly. It seems like you went through all this trouble to save your mom, but she only seems interested in Stefan"
35257,Nadia, That's Katherine. I didn't expect mother-daughter boozy brunches
35258,Matt," Yeah, but you did expect something"
35259,Nadia, Are you going to play a card or what?
35260,Matt," Look. I've been where you are. My mom used to disappear for weeks at a time and then show up one day out of the blue like nothing happened. Before you knew it, I'd be at the stove, making her a grilled cheese"
35261,Nadia, This isn't like that
35262,Matt," Isn't it? She decides when you're worth it on her watch, but guess what: You're never gonna be as interesting as the next guy she wants to sleep with"
35263,Nadia," Matt, you'd say anything to help Elena. I'm not an idiot"
35264,Matt, You are if you think that Katherine's gonna choose you… because she's not
35265,Nadia," Do you know why you found yourself making all those sandwiches? Because the second your mom walked back into your life, you forgot all those horrible things that she did because at the end of the day, she's still your mom,and you love her. Give me your wrist. The Vervain is gone. Our fun is over"
35266,Matt, Wait. Since I'm gonna forget this anyway...
35267,Nadia, What was that for?
35268,Matt," Thank you.If I'm gonna be threatened and held against my will, I could think of worse scenarios"
35269,Nadia, What the hell?
35270,Matt, What'd you expect? Elena's my best friend. I'll always protect her
35271,Nadia, It just sucks. You were the only decent person in this town
35272,Matt," And I still am, and so are you .You could have k*ll me this morning, and you didn't. You're not like her, and you know it"
35273,Nadia," Forget everything you're not supposed to know. We partied, we slept together, then I left. Good-bye"
35274,Caroline, Going somewhere?
35275,Nadia," Actually, I am, and you're in my way"
35276,Caroline," Matt, are you ok?"
35277,Matt, Yeah. Why? What's going on in here?
35278,Caroline, You texted me from Nadia's phone. So you compelled him again
35279,Nadia, And they say blonds are dumb
35280,Caroline, What are you doing to him? Tell me!
35281,Matt," Nadia, stop!"
35282,Nadia," You may not remember, Matt, but this is your fault. Trust me"
35283,Tyler, Young hybrid b*at old vampire every time!
35284,Matt, Wait a second! Does anyone want to tell me how this is my fault?
35285,Damon," Elena. Don’t. I said don't!You come in here, you ain't coming out"
35286,Stefan, What exactly happened here?
35287,Damon," I wanted revenge, got stuck with the vampire virus, almost k*ll my last friend. Typical Damon"
35288,Katherine," Enzo texted me the address here. Damon, we're here to help you"
35289,Damon, You can't help me. I feed on vampires now. You're both vampires. Do yourselves a favor and leave
35290,Stefan," Well, that's not gonna happen"
35291,Damon, Stay back!
35292,Stefan," I'm not afraid of you, Damon"
35293,Katherine, Neither am I
35294,Damon, You better get out. What the hell is wrong with you?
35295,Katherine," I'm proving to you that you're not a lost cause, Damon"
35296,Damon, Elena…
35297,Katherine," See? Damon, you can resist this. You can do it. Why? Because you love me, and that love is stronger than any craving"
35298,Damon," Get away from me, Elena"
35299,Stefan," Elena, he's gonna k*ll you"
35300,Katherine," No. No. He's not going to. He's not going to. You can do this, Damon. Fight it. There you go. Turn around. There you go"
35301,Stefan," Damon, stop! Damon, let go of her, let go of her!"
35302,Katherine, Stefan!
35303,Stefan, Let go!
35304,Katherine, No! He's going... to k*ll me!
35305,Stefan," Here, Damon. Look over here. You smell that? Feed on me, not her. That's good. That's good. Feed on me"
35306,Caroline," Well, the only thing Matt remembers is that they slept together. Well... so…"
35307,Tyler," Care, I never said sorry. I was pissed, but..."
35308,Caroline," No excuses, ok? Look. We can get past this together. Ok? I just want us to be good again, you know?"
35309,Tyler, I said I was sorry.I didn't say I was past it
35310,Caroline," Of course. Obviously. I mean, Rome wasn't built in a day"
35311,Tyler," How evolved do you think I am?You slept with Klaus. You slept with the guy that k*ll my mom. What's a fair amount of time for me to get past that? A week, a month? Tell me. What sounds right to you?"
35312,Caroline, Ok. You made your point
35313,Tyler," Look. I'm not trying to be a dick, but the idea of us being good, it's not gonna happen"
35314,Caroline, Understood
35315,Damon," I know you can't help yourself, but if you bring home a rabid animal, you're gonna get bit"
35316,Stefan, Never should have told you to leave
35317,Damon," I'm gonna k*ll you, Stefan. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but at some point I'm gonna rip open your throat, and you're gonna die"
35318,Stefan," Oh, come on, Damon. You think I'm afraid of a ripper? Who do you think invented the word? You know that feeling you get when you're around vampire bl*od, that burning in your veins? I feel that on a daily basis, and there's a way to control it"
35319,Damon, And let me guess… it'd bring you no greater pleasure than to teach me
35320,Stefan," No. It's a good guess, but right now, I'm gonna go get you a little bit more Vervain, and then I'm gonna have a drink, and I'm gonna let you think about what a royal pain in the ass you've been lately. You're my brother.I'm not gonna give up on you. I never will"
35321,Damon, She has
35322,Stefan, You talking about Elena?
35323,Damon, Mm-hmm
35324,Stefan, She practically got herself k*ll to prove a point today
35325,Damon," You remember the vampire ripper Jesse? When he attacked me, Elena had to k*ll him, but if there was the slightest chance that there was another way to stop him, she would have taken it"
35326,Stefan," Yeah, so?"
35327,Damon," She knew it would be impossible for me to resist her bl*od, and then she just kicked you a stake and essentially told you to k*ll me"
35328,Stefan, So what are you saying? You saying that Elena wanted me to k*ll you?
35329,Damon," You got another excuse, hmm? That's what I thought"
35330,Katherine, I could use a steak
35331,Nadia, You're chipper. That must mean Damon is dead
35332,Katherine," Not quite. In fact, he continues to be the bane of my existence, but... Stefan and I had a moment. Heh. Don't worry. I'll keep the details to myself, but it definitely reaffirmed his feelings for Elena, i.e. me. Heh"
35333,Nadia," So, uh, it's only a matter of time. Sounds like you're going to get everything you want"
35334,Katherine, Of course I will. Assuming that you took care of the Matt situation
35335,Nadia, Your secret is safe
35336,Katherine," Perfect. So I'm in a really good mood right now, which means I don't really feel like worrying whatever's making you mopey"
35337,Nadia, You won't have to worry about me for much longer
35338,Katherine, What's that supposed to mean?
35339,Nadia, Tyler Lockwood bit me
35340,Stefan, Hey. When'd you get here?
35341,Caroline," Eh, about 1 ½ of these ago. You were right. I brought this on myself. I knew the Klaus thing was gonna come with consequences. Guess now I just have to deal with it and learn from my mistakes"
35342,Stefan, Glad I could help. So did you find Matt?
35343,Caroline," Yes, and Tyler was right. Nadia's been compelling him to forget things"
35344,Stefan, What do you mean? What kind of things?
35345,Caroline," Who knows? He tried to message me, but Nadia stopped him. ""Help. K"" was all I got"
35346,Stefan, Huh
35347,Caroline, So you and Elena? What's the verdict?
35348,Stefan," Um, well, the verdict is she's acting strange. She kissed me"
35349,Caroline, Excuse me?
35350,Stefan," Yeah. My car broke down, so we got a hotel room so she could shower…"
35351,Caroline," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys got a hotel room with a shower?"
35352,Stefan," Yeah, but it wasn't like that. I mean, I stopped it obviously. I couldn't do it to Damon"
35353,Caroline," Yeah, but she could? I just... I don't get it. She knows that this would destroy him. What is she doing?"
35354,Stefan," That's what I mean. It's like she's given up on Damon, and he thinks that she was trying to get me to k*ll him tonight"
35355,Caroline, But she would never want him dead
35356,Stefan," Unless... Matt texted you, ""help. K,"" before Nadia stopped him. ""K,"" as in Katherine, and when Katherine was dying, Nadia figured out a way to put Katherine's spirit inside Nadia's body"
35357,Caroline," Yeah, but that didn't happen because Katherine had a change of heart. No. No. You don't think that… it's impossible that she'd be… we would have noticed. It's Elena. We know her… Oh, my God"
35358,Nadia," Good evening, sir. If I could trouble you for a moment. I'm looking for someone. Her name is Katerina Petrova. She was last seen outside of London in 1492. She's on the run. I need to find her. I need to ask her why she abandoned me"
35359,Katherine, Nadia?
35360,Nadia, Please. I need to know
35361,Katherine," Nadia, I'm right here. I'm right here"
35362,Nadia, Uhh. I was dreaming how I searched for you from village to village
35363,Katherine, I know. I heard you. You said that I abandoned you. You were ripped from my arms as a baby. It's completely different
35364,Nadia, Not for a child without a mother
35365,Katherine," You know, all this guilt is really taking all the fun out of this mother-daughter outing. I'm sorry Tyler bit you, but you're not going to die"
35366,Nadia, Did you ask Klaus for his bl*od?
35367,Katherine," Oh, my, you really are delirious. Nadia, he would love nothing more than to watch my daughter die"
35368,Nadia, And you don't want to risk being outed
35369,Katherine," No, I don't. So, that's why I called him"
35370,Wes, Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maxfield
35371,Katherine," And luckily for us, he'll love nothing more than to study your bl*od"
35372,Wes, Werewolf venom isn't easy to come by
35373,Nadia, Get away from me
35374,Katherine," It’s ok. Nadia, it's ok"
35375,Wes," Listen to your mother. The venom in your bl*od is a toxin with basic chemical properties. Once I study its make-up, I can... Create the antidote"
35376,Katherine," It's ok. Come on, come on, honey. There you go"
35377,Nadia," If I'd known I just had to die to drag your attention from Stefan, I would have tried it a long time ago"
35378,Katherine, If you're trying to make me feel guilty... It's almost working
35379,Nadia, I'm just glad you're here now
35380,Katherine," Me, too. I'm going to be a better mother, starting right now. I promise you... I'm going to save your life"
35381,Damon, she's brilliant
35382,Stefan," We haven't noticed that Katherine's been inhabiting Elena's body for weeks, and that's all you have to say?"
35383,Damon, Yep
35384,Stefan," And you realize that it was Katherine who broke up with you, it wasn't Elena"
35385,Damon, Mm-hmm
35386,Stefan," Right. So, your little m*rder spree with Enzo where you k*ll Aaron, you nearly k*ll Jeremy, tried to k*ll Wes but you got infected with that ripper virus... That was all you reacting to Katherine"
35387,Damon," I'm trying to figure out why you decided to tell a starving, bloodthirsty, vampire-feeding ripper that his Nemesis is still walking around alive and well while I am stuck in this cell and can't do anything about it"
35388,Stefan, I have it under control
35389,Damon, I'd love to hear this
35390,Matt, Hang on here. Katherine's still alive? How is that even possible?
35391,Caroline," Remember that time Nadia's ex Gregor hitched a ride in your head? Ok, well, it's kind of the same thing. Katherine is a passenger in Elena, except it's worse because none of us seemed to notice"
35392,Tyler, She was at my house. How did none of us figure it out?
35393,Caroline," Because it's Katherine, and she's smart, and conniving and sneaky and... We're the worst friends ever"
35394,Jeremy, This makes no sense. She saved my life. She gave me CPR when Enzo tried to k*ll me. Katherine would never do that
35395,Bonnie," That's what made her so believable. She played Elena to a t. If she let you die, her cover was blown"
35396,Caroline, I was sleeping 3 feet away from her. She picked out my bitter ball dress. And I let her use my toothpaste
35397,Stefan," Yeah, well, did she lure you into a hotel room to make out with you?"
35398,Tyler, She's the reason I found out about you and Klaus
35399,Caroline," Of course. Oh, my God"
35400,Tyler," So, how do we k*ll the bitch?"
35401,Stefan," Well, passengers can be expelled from the host. Saw it happen with Matt. Gregor died and Matt lived. All we have to do is stab her with a traveler kn*fe"
35402,Matt, I still have the kn*fe that Nadia gave me
35403,Stefan, Perfect. Go get it
35404,Caroline," Hold on, guys, this is Katherine that we're talking about. She's gonna see a sneak attack coming from a mile away. We gotta get her to come to us. Get her guard down. Corner her"
35405,Tyler, Fat chance you'll be seeing her today. I'm pretty sure I bit Nadia
35406,Matt, What do you mean you bit her?
35407,Tyler, I mean she was attacking Caroline and I might've nipped her a little
35408,Matt, And you're just mentioning this now?
35409,Caroline," Hey, guys, focus. Tyler's right. Katherine is not going to leave Nadia's side unless not leaving compromises her identity"
35410,Matt, Which means?
35411,Caroline, We gotta invite her to something that Elena can't say no to
35412,Bonnie, A surprise party? Seriously? I wanted a spa day.You try feeling the death of every supernatural creature who passes through you on their way to the other side
35413,Jeremy," I'm not saying you don't deserve it. Besides, your birthday isn't until next week"
35414,Caroline, That's what makes it a surprise
35415,Katherine," Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would want a big party for her birthday"
35416,Caroline," Of course she does. So, when can you get over to Stefan's to help us set up?"
35417,Katherine, I can't
35418,Caroline, You can't?
35419,Katherine," I would love to, but I just... I can't. Um... I'm making arrangements for Aaron Whitmore's funeral. The only reason Damon k*ll him was because we broke up, so, I kind of feel like I owe it to Aaron. You understand, right?"
35420,Caroline," Of course. No, that's really nice of you"
35421,Nadia," Elena, you're so popular today"
35422,Katherine," Hey, Bonnie"
35423,Bonnie, Hey. How's it going?
35424,Katherine, You sound tired
35425,Bonnie, Yeah. I had to pull an all-nighter for my sociology exam and then woke up to a coven of dead Russian witches passing through me on the way to the other side. Sorry. Self-pity. So not cute
35426,Katherine," No, I totally get it. You're the anchor now. That must be... exhausting"
35427,Bonnie," Do you want to maybe meet up for a coffee or something? It's just been one of those days, you know?"
35428,Katherine," Yeah. Well, ha! This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm actually at the day spa right now buying you a gift certificate for your birthday. It was supposed to be a surprise but, well, surprise!"
35429,Bonnie, You read my mind. That's so you
35430,Katherine," Hey, look, I'll check in with you later"
35431,Bonnie, Ok
35432,Katherine, Why are they being so clingy today?
35433,Damon, What are you doing?
35434,Stefan, There you go. Drink
35435,Damon, I need more
35436,Stefan, Too bad
35437,Damon, That was nothing
35438,Stefan," That's exactly 4 ounces. When you were out k*ll vampires,you said one vampire kept you good for 8 hours. So, our friend Caroline did a little bit of math..."
35439,Damon, Caroline?
35440,Stefan," Relax. She had a calculator. So, 4 ounces 3 times a day should be just enough to help manage the hunger"
35441,Damon, You mean manage me
35442,Stefan, So you don't rip anyone's head off. We'll deal with your crisis once we get Elena back
35443,Damon," I'll deal with my own crisis. Listen, you just let me out of here. I'll find Wes, I'll get the antidote"
35444,Stefan," And then what, huh? You skip town? Leave it to me to tell Elena everything you did after you thought she broke up with you?"
35445,Damon," Who are you calling there, buddy?"
35446,Stefan, Katherine's been making a lot of excuses and I have a feeling she won't be able to say no to me
35447,Stefan, It's your phone. Elena is calling. Answer it
35448,Damon, Elena. Hey
35449,Katherine, Hey. Um... how are you?
35450,Damon," Well, you know. Strung up, hungry. Same old, same old"
35451,Katherine," Now that the dust has settled, I was hoping that, I don't know, maybe we can talk about what happened at the farmhouse. Can I see you?"
35452,Damon, Ok. Sure. Why don't you just come to the house and we'll talk about it here?
35453,Katherine, Perfect. I'll see you soon
35454,Damon, Ok. Bye
35455,Katherine, Damon knows that he tried to k*ll me less than 24 hours ago. There isn't a single vampire-craving bone in his body that would risk putting his precious Elena back in that kind of danger again
35456,Nadia, And yet he's desperate to see her. Just like her other friends
35457,Katherine, They know
35458,Stefan, Doesn't make any sense.She's dodged everyone's attempt to try to get her over here. Now she voluntarily wants to come over?
35459,Damon, Unless...
35460,Stefan, Unless?
35461,Damon, She was testing me. She knows
35462,Nadia, Money for information. I was told you saw Katerina Petrova k*ll a man in cold bl*od outside the court of Versailles. I want to know if that's true
35463,Nadia, She's been on the run for... 228 years
35464,Katherine, You passed out in the car. I didn't want to wake you
35465,Nadia, Huh. Perfect. I can make my peace with the universe
35466,Katherine, Don't talk like that. I brought you here so that I could hide you till Wes finds a way to heal you
35467,Nadia, You should leave now. While you can. There's no point in trying to save me
35468,Katherine," I didn't raise you to be a quitter. And I promise... As soon as you get better, we're leaving. Together"
35469,Caroline," Of course. The farther she gets, the worse our chances are of ever seeing Elena again. It's bad enough that we didn't recognize Katherine. We also just blew our only advantage"
35470,Damon, Nothing a little locator spell can't fix
35471,Liv, Let me guess. Matter of life and death?
35472,Bonnie," Kind of. Yeah, um, do you remember that locator spell we did the other night?"
35473,Liv," Sure. We ended up saving him. You're welcome, by the way"
35474,Bonnie, Now we need you to find his sister
35475,Liv, Why? She ran away from home?
35476,Bonnie, No. She's been possessed by her evil doppelganger
35477,Liv, Ok...
35478,Bonnie, Liv. Will you help us?
35479,Liv, I can be convinced
35480,Damon, Need bl*od
35481,Tyler, You just had your lunch 30 minutes ago
35482,Damon, Or you could give me a couple sips of that hybrid juice. I can be on my way and I'll take up my ripper situation with Wes
35483,Tyler, Not gonna happen
35484,Damon, Can I ask you a question without you getting all wolf man on me?
35485,Tyler, Do I have a choice?
35486,Damon, Why are you still here?
35487,Tyler, I'm a hybrid and you need a baby-sitter
35488,Damon," Oh, no, I mean here here, in Mystic Falls here. Your family's all dead and I don't see you getting a job at the Grill. Yet I don't see you in a Whitmore hoodie, either. Something tells me that there's a little masochistic voice inside your head that's trying to convince you that you and Caroline still have a fighting chance in hell"
35489,Tyler, I think you have enough problems without having to worry about me
35490,Damon, You're probably right. One small difference between you and me... You want to hear it?
35491,Tyler, Not especially
35492,Damon," You see, even after all the terrible things I do, Elena still chose me.Because she's fighting for me. Caroline, on the other hand, chose the nuclear option. You know that big, red button that just nukes your entire relationship once and for all? Well, sleeping with the guy that k*ll your mom was kind of her way of slamming her hand down"
35493,Tyler," You think Elena will still want you back after this? It's over, Damon. Fix yourself and run. Far away"
35494,Damon, I plan on it. How's New Orleans this time of year?
35495,Tyler," You really think Elena's gonna forgive you? Look at you. You k*ll her friend. You almost k*ll her brother. You nearly k*ll her. You're a joke, Damon"
35496,Damon, Says the guy pining after the girl who slept with Klaus
35497,Tyler, You don't know anything about me
35498,Damon, I know how to get you in this cell
35499,Caroline," Hey, ready for a changing of the guard... Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Tyler?"
35500,Tyler, I'm ok
35501,Caroline, He fed on you?
35502,Tyler, I said I'm fine
35503,Caroline, Why would you come in here?
35504,Tyler, Why do you think? Damon knew exactly how to piss me off
35505,Stefan, What the hell happened?
35506,Tyler, I think Damon went to go find Wes
35507,Liv," Elena's necklace. Candle. Map. Give me your hand. You're Elena's brother. That makes you bl*od. So, hand it over"
35508,Bonnie," Actually, he's her cousin. It's a long story"
35509,Liv, Whatever. Close enough
35510,Bonnie, That's not... That's not how I taught you
35511,Liv," Relax, Mr. Miyagi. I'm feeling my way through it, ok? Now, what do I say, again? Does Elena look anything like you?"
35512,Jeremy," Uh, same color hair"
35513,Liv, What about her eyes? Are they as pretty as yours?
35514,Bonnie, Is this really necessary?
35515,Liv, I'm sorry. I'm searching for his sister/cousin's doppelganger in my mind. I'll take all the help I can get. Does your sister spend a lot of time in church?
35516,Nadia, Are you leaving?
35517,Katherine, I'm going to check on Wes. He's taking too long
35518,Nadia, Be careful. They're all out looking for you
35519,Katherine, That's never stopped me before
35520,Wes, Hello?
35521,Damon," What's up, doc?"
35522,Wes, How did you find me?
35523,Damon," I called my friend Enzo and asked him about the little adventure he had with you. Gotta say, long way off the tenure track, huh? Huh. I take it the Augustine society hit a bit of a rough streak"
35524,Wes," There is no Augustine society, Damon. It's just me"
35525,Damon," Well, then I guess you're my guy. You see, I have this long road ahead of me to win my ex-girlfriend back. But I don't have a chance in hell if I'm lusting over her bl*od. Follow?"
35526,Wes," Even if I did cure you of this virus, what difference does it make? So you stop feeding on your friends and go back to feeding on innocent people. Is that really gonna impress Elena Gilbert?"
35527,Damon, Look at me. You did this to me
35528,Wes, I didn't do this to you. You are this. I simply held up the mirror
35529,Damon, Now it's my turn to play doctor
35530,Nadia, That was fun
35531,Matt, You think?
35532,Nadia, You must really trust Rebekah. Watch this.I'm going to steal her earrings... And you're not going to say anything. See? You're hanging out with an original vampire and you're not even on vervain. Trust
35533,Matt, You know she's an original?
35534,Nadia, I recognized her on the dance floor. I was hoping she'd know something about her brother Klaus' favorite vampire: Katherine Pierce. Maybe you heard of her?
35535,Matt," Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of her. I know her. Why do you care?"
35536,Nadia," Because she is my mother, and I'd very much like to meet her. I'm going to take your ring. Now I have a reason to see you again"
35537,Katherine," Wes? What the hell is taking so I... No. No. Please, no. No"
35538,Katherine," Nadia, I'm coming back to the church right now"
35539,Stefan, She's not at the church anymore. She's with me at home
35540,Katherine," Stefan, why do you have Nadia's phone?"
35541,Stefan," She doesn't have much time left, Katherine"
35542,Katherine, I don't know what you're talking about
35543,Stefan, I know that it's you and I know that you care about Nadia. That's why I brought her here
35544,Katherine, Prove it. Put her on the phone
35545,Nadia, Katherine? Run
35546,Stefan," You can always run, Katherine. It's what you do best. Or you can come home and see your daughter one last time before she dies. It's your choice"
35547,Matt, Your hands are like ice
35548,Nadia, Gregor
35549,Matt," No, it's Matt. I'm not..."
35550,Nadia," Gregor, I'm sorry I betrayed you. I did it for my mother. I did everything for her"
35551,Matt, I know you did
35552,Nadia, Forgive me?
35553,Matt," Yes. I forgive you. Hey, hey. Shh. It's ok. It's ok. Shh"
35554,Nadia, I... I don't want to die. I don't want to die
35555,Nadia, What's gonna happen when I die?
35556,Bonnie, I'll take your hand... And you'll go to the other side. Just like that
35557,Nadia, Will it hurt?
35558,Bonnie, You won't feel any pain
35559,Katherine, I'm here to see my daughter. Nadia
35560,Nadia, You came back for me
35561,Katherine, I won't leave you again
35562,Nadia, Did you find a way to save me?
35563,Katherine, Klaus' bl*od would've saved you... If I'd asked for it
35564,Nadia, You would have outed yourself
35565,Katherine, But you would've been alive. And now it's too late
35566,Nadia, My mother's name is Katherine. I'm looking for her
35567,Katherine," You found me. Nadia, I'm right here"
35568,Nadia, She's a liar. And a m*rder. She manipulates. She betrays. She will do anything to survive
35569,Katherine," Nadia. No, I'm... I'm right here. Nadia, look at me. Look at me. I'm here. I'm right here"
35570,Nadia, I'm looking for my mother
35571,Katherine," This is not what your life should've been. 500 years searching for a mother who ended up... being me. Let me show you what your life should've been. What your perfect day would have been like. You and I had a little cottage. It was an ordinary summer day. You'd been playing outside.So, you were tired and it was time for bed. You told me about the fort that you'd built. Out in the woods by the river. And so I asked if I could visit. And you said when the sun came up in the morning, and I said... Good night, Nadia. Sleep well. Your mother loves you"
35572,Katherine, So. This is it
35573,Damon," Hello, Katherine. You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?"
35574,Katherine," Ok. So. Who's got the kn*fe? Which one of you is gonna get to k*ll the elusive Katherine Pierce once and for all? What? Suddenly everyone's speechless? When I was on my deathbed, you all had plenty to say. Is it you, Tyler? Because I triggered the werewolf curse? Gave you an identity and made you matter?"
35575,Tyler, You've done nothing for me
35576,Katherine," Oh, please, Tyler. If I hadn't walked into your life, you'd just be a wasted nobody with a boozy mom and a temper problem"
35577,Caroline, Don't. Don't
35578,Katherine, And you. I'm not worried about you offing me. Because we both know I made you better by making you a vampire
35579,Caroline," Good-bye, Katherine"
35580,Katherine," Bye-bye, Caroline"
35581,Katherine," Ooh. The one girl here who actually appreciates how beautiful you are. You wouldn't stab me in the heart, Matty blue? No, I don't think so. You will definitely go down as the best night I never had. Oh well"
35582,Matt, Oh well
35583,Katherine," Well, little Gilbert, it was nice to have a brother for a second there. When you weren't being so damn annoying!"
35584,Katherine," Bon Bon, no need for good-byes. I'll see you on the flip side"
35585,Katherine," Damon. Oh, how you'd love nothing more than to drive that blade right through me"
35586,Damon," We've already done this, Kitty Kat. I've said all I needed to say"
35587,Katherine," I know, but I never got to say what I needed to say to you. I'm sorry. You blame me for who you are. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I turned you. I'm sorry that you didn't get to die as a forgotten nobody on a bloody battlefield, and your father didn't get to live another day to be disgraced by you. Damon, I'm sorry that I gave your life purpose. Passion. Drive. Desire. I'm sorry that you are who you are because I'm the one that taught you how to love"
35588,Damon," I'll see you in hell, Katherine"
35589,Katherine," Stefan. You know, I always wondered what it would be like to be loved by you. You've got to admit, that one fleeting moment... Your feelings were real.This truly has been the role of a lifetime. Stefan, I love you. I've always loved you"
35590,Katherine, Uhh. I guess this is how... Our love story ends
35591,Jeremy, Stefan said we should bury her in the woods
35592,Matt, Screw that. She deserves better
35593,Jeremy, You need some help?
35594,Matt, No. I got this
35595,Damon, Why is she not waking up?
35596,Stefan," When Gregor left Matt's body, it took him a while to wake up, too. Which gives us a little bit of time to talk about what the hell you did"
35597,Damon," Relax. Thanks to Tyler's friendly donation, I'll be fine for a couple hours"
35598,Stefan," A few hours, huh? And then what? What's the plan?"
35599,Damon, Tell her everything I did. Let the chips crash and burn where they may
35600,Stefan, Optimistic
35601,Damon, I don't want to be another Katherine Pierce. Katherine spent her whole life running from her problems only to die here. All alone
35602,Caroline, Is it wrong that I feel...
35603,Tyler, Victorious?
35604,Caroline," Sad. I know that Katherine is a horrible person, but..."
35605,Tyler, But you see the good in people
35606,Caroline, You mean Klaus. Because I saw the good in Klaus
35607,Tyler, Your words. Not mine
35608,Caroline, Your hybrid bite just k*ll someone and no one even batted an eye. I sleep with the wrong guy weeks ago and I don't hear the end of it. How is that fair?
35609,Tyler," I don't know, Care. Maybe people just expect more from you"
35610,Caroline," Why? Because being good comes so easy to me? Well, guess what, Tyler? It doesn't. I am a vampire. I have the same impulses as you.So, I'm allowed to make some mistakes along the way. Yes, I slept with Klaus... But after you walked away from me. That was my choice and I am living with it and I don't need to be hearing about it every 5 seconds. So, just get over it or get out of my life, but... I'm done feeling guilty"
35611,Bonnie," This is for you, dad. I want you to know how much I miss you"
35612,Katherine," You've got to be kidding me, right? Something tells me I'm about 5 centuries delayed on the whole believing in a higher power thing"
35613,Bonnie," Well, you're here. That means it worked. You're dead"
35614,Katherine," True. Then again, your friends didn't really give me much of a choice in the matter. Using my only daughter against me? Harsh. I suppose I could've spent the next 500 years running, but for what? My daughter was dying. Stefan would never love me. I was back to having nothing. Elena wins again"
35615,Bonnie,Let's get this over with
35616,Katherine, I'm really starting to get sick of Elena getting everything that I want
35617,Bonnie, What is that supposed to mean?
35618,Katherine, Wes had no intention of helping Nadia
35619,Stefan," You can always run, Katherine. It's your choice"
35620,Wes, A good day. I've managed to extract the werewolf venom from Nadia Petrova's bl*od. The addition of the venom will make the ripper virus even more lethal to vampires
35621,Katherine, He was just using her as a case study in his project to wipe out vampires off the face of the earth
35622,Bonnie, Why are you telling me this?
35623,Damon, Hey. Elena?
35624,Katherine," I've said it before and I'll say it again. Elena had the life I always wanted. Heh. Well, until now"
35625,Bonnie," Katherine, what did you do?"
35626,Katherine," Stefan thought he gave me a choice: Run or die. But that's not really much of a choice, is it? After all, Nadia was the only person in this world who really loved me.And I wasn't about to let my daughter die alone. But Katherine Pierce wasn't about to go gentle, either"
35627,Elena, Hi
35628,Damon, Are you... you?
35629,Elena," Yeah. Yeah, it's me. I'm here"
35630,Katherine," I left Elena with a little bit of a parting gift. If I can't have Stefan, then no one can. Ok. Now I'm ready.Nothing's happening. What's wrong?"
35631,Bonnie, I don't know. This has never happened before
35632,Katherine," Bonnie, what are you doing? Let me pass through. Why won't you let me pass through?"
35633,Bonnie, I don't know. I don't control it
35634,Katherine, What?
35635,Bonnie, It's not up to me
35636,Katherine, Then who is it up to? Bonnie!
35637,Bonnie," I can't help you, Katherine"
35638,Katherine," What... no, no no! Nooooo!"
35639,Bonnie, What is she doing?
35640,Caroline," Having fun, obviously"
35641,Matt," It's about time, too. Take it off!"
35642,Caroline, Matt!
35643,Elena," Jeremy, come on. To friends"
35644,Everyone, To friends!
35645,Elena, Am I seriously that easy to impersonate or do you guys not know me at all?
35646,Jeremy," Elena, what's going on?"
35647,Elena, When have I ever danced on a bar half-naked? Do you think that I would come to a college bar with my underage brother and do Tequila shots?
35648,Matt," Elena, what are you talking about?"
35649,Elena," I'm not Elena, Matt. I'm Katherine. It's not me. You guys know me. I wouldn't do that. Guys, Katherine has taken over my body. This isn't me"
35650,Elena, Hello? Hello?
35651,Stefan, Hey. You're awake
35652,Elena, Stefan. What are you doing here? Where is everyone?
35653,Stefan, Everyone's gone. The whole school cleared out for spring break. You've been in and out since you first woke up
35654,Elena," Oh. Ok, yeah, that makes sense. I thought I was going crazy. What's going on? What…?"
35655,Stefan, We had to seal you into the building. We have a lot of catching up to do
35656,Elena," The last thing I remember, I was running through the woods, and my head felt like it was being attacked by Katherine's whole life. Then I saw Damon, I threw my arms around him, and...Then nothing"
35657,Stefan," Yeah, that was about 3 weeks ago"
35658,Elena," 3 weeks ago? Wow. 3 weeks, huh? And yet, it took just one second for Katherine to infect me with some virus that makes me want to k*ll all my friends"
35659,Stefan," Well, you know Katherine. She's not about to go out without a grand finale"
35660,Elena, Do you really think this whole lockdown is necessary? I mean… I feel fine
35661,Stefan," Look, we shouldn't take any chances. If Damon taught us anything, it's that the virus makes you want to attack at the mere scent of vampire bl*od"
35662,Elena, How did you...
35663,Stefan, Liv
35664,Elena, Liv?
35665,Stefan," She's a new witch. Bonnie's been teaching her some spells. Look, I know that this is a lot to process, but just know that Caroline is out looking for an antidote, and in the meantime, we've figured out a way to ration bl*od to keep you satiated. We're gonna figure this out, ok?"
35666,Elena, I need to talk to Damon
35667,Damon, Hilarious. Give me the damn cup. Wipe that smile off your face
35668,Jeremy," Hey, you're lucky I'm even helping you, considering the last thing you did for me was to tell Enzo to strangle me to death"
35669,Damon, Quit crying. You're still around
35670,Matt," Yeah, more than we can say for Aaron Whitmore. Weren't he and Elena tight?"
35671,Jeremy, Yep
35672,Matt, Does she know Damon k*ll him?
35673,Jeremy, I don't know. Does she?
35674,Damon," No, she doesn't, because I'm gonna be the one to tell her. And if either one of you clowns b*at me to it, I'll rip your tongue out"
35675,Damon, Don't even think about it
35676,Jeremy, Damon's phone
35677,Elena, Jer?
35678,Jeremy, Elena. Hey. How you feeling?
35679,Elena, Confused but good. I miss you
35680,Jeremy, Same here
35681,Damon," I k*ll you once before, Gilbert. I'll k*ll you again"
35682,Jeremy, Someone wants to speak to you
35683,Damon," Hey, you"
35684,Elena, Hey you
35685,Damon," So, eat anyone yet?"
35686,Elena," Nope. So far, I am symptom-free. Although Stefan still has me on the ""Damon diet"" just in case"
35687,Damon," Oh, yeah, it sucks. Oof. You're gonna be craving carbs constantly. But hey, you know what? There's a plus side.You get to keep your girlish figure"
35688,Elena, I'm calling you on a pay phone
35689,Damon," Well, how retro of you. Does that mean you've memorized my phone number?"
35690,Elena," Maybe. Katherine put a pass code on my cell, so, I can't use it"
35691,Damon," Ah, that would explain all those crazy Instagram pics you've been uploading lately"
35692,Elena, What?!
35693,Damon," Kidding, kidding"
35694,Elena," Damon, that's not funny. I don't know what I've been doing for the last 3 weeks"
35695,Damon," I know. I'm sorry. Well, what do you want to know? I'll tell you"
35696,Elena, How did she do it?
35697,Damon, How did she do what?
35698,Elena, Break your heart
35699,Damon, Oh. That. I don't know.It's not like it's been playing on a loop in my head over and over again so I barely remember
35700,Elena," I'm so sorry. I really am. I mean the last thing I remember, I was running into your arms and I felt so safe"
35701,Damon," Well, it was all downhill from there"
35702,Elena, I wanted to fight for you. I still do
35703,Damon," Oh, Elena, the second we're cured of this and we don't want to rip each other's heads off, I am going to hunt you down and give you the most mind-blowing night of your life"
35704,Elena, I think I could schedule you in. One question: How exactly do we cure this?
35705,Wes, I've managed to extract the werewolf venom from Nadia Petrova's bl*od. The addition of the venom will make the ripper virus even more lethal to vampires
35706,Caroline," Oh, my God"
35707,Enzo," So, werewolves are real. I was told that was just like, you know, a joke. I'm Enzo"
35708,Caroline, The Enzo?
35709,Enzo," No, the other one"
35710,Caroline," All right, other Enzo, I don't know what it is you're doing here, but I don't want any part of it"
35711,Enzo, I'm here for the same reason you are. I want this vampire-feeding virus out of our lives
35712,Caroline, Why? You want your k*ll buddy back? k*ll innocent people not as much fun when you're alone?
35713,Enzo," Right. Damon mentioned you get a little judgy. Then again, he also said you had a thing for accents"
35714,Caroline, Just stay out of it. We don't need any more problems
35715,Enzo, Then you're not the least bit impressed that I have the antidote?
35716,Damon, Can we talk about the irony of Katherine Pierce sitting through a college lecture?
35717,Elena," Oh, no, I'm flunking, aren't I?"
35718,Damon," No way. If anything, there's some sucker probably compelled to spend his entire spring break doing your homework"
35719,Elena," Yeah, you're probably right. Let's add that to the list of things I need to fix, starting with Aaron"
35720,Damon, Aaron? What the hell does he have to do with anything?
35721,Elena, I haven't seen or talked to him since he found out that I was a vampire and thought I wanted to k*ll him
35722,Damon," Well, uh...you probably won't find him"
35723,Elena, Why?
35724,Damon, No reason
35725,Stefan, Elena
35726,Elena," Uh, Stefan just got here. He bought me a new cell phone. I'm gonna call you right back, ok?"
35727,Stefan, You ok?
35728,Elena," Uh, not feeling so good all of a sudden"
35729,Stefan, It's because you're starving
35730,Elena, Yeah
35731,Stefan," Here, I got you 4 ounces of my bl*od. You won't be scaling any buildings, but it'll curb the cravings"
35732,Elena, Thank you. Ahh. I need more
35733,Stefan, I'm sorry
35734,Elena," I feel fine, Stefan. I just… I just need a little more"
35735,Stefan," You're not fine, Elena"
35736,Elena, Trust me. I just… I can handle this
35737,Stefan, Think so?
35738,Elena, Yeah
35739,Stefan," You're not fine, Elena"
35740,Elena," She's turning me into a monster. I'm a ripper, aren't I?"
35741,Stefan," You'll feed until you k*ll, yeah"
35742,Elena," I hate her. No, you know what? I hate myself. Because I was dumb enough to sit next to her while she was dying and actually forgive her"
35743,Stefan, Hey
35744,Elena, Please tell me that's some good news
35745,Caroline, Bad news. It's not the same virus
35746,Stefan, What is it?
35747,Caroline," Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of his virus. When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her bl*od and then he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her bl*od and put it into the virus"
35748,Stefan," Hey, what do you mean werewolf venom? That means it's fatal"
35749,Elena," Oh, my God"
35750,Caroline, Hello? You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining? There's an antidote. It just requires you to come meet me. I'll text you the address
35751,Stefan, Or you can just bring it over here
35752,Caroline," No, you have to go there, and don't ask me why because I can't tell you"
35753,Stefan," Caroline, that doesn't make any sense. Just tell me exactly…"
35754,Caroline," If I could tell you, don't you think I would be there right now to help Elena?I'll text you the address"
35755,Stefan, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on
35756,Caroline," The Travelers don't want anyone to know what they're up to. And by anyone I mean newbie emo witch types with bad attitudes. Just get there fast, ok? (They hang up) "
35757,Stefan, I’ll see you soon
35758,Elena, Stefan?
35759,Stefan, Yeah?
35760,Elena, Why did she stay?
35761,Stefan, What do you mean?
35762,Elena, Katherine. Why didn't she run like she normally does?Why did she stay?
35763,Stefan, Oh. You know Katherine. Staying alive wasn't enough. She...She wanted it all
35764,Elena, You mean you. She wanted you. Did we ever…?
35765,Stefan," Actually, we... We kissed"
35766,Elena," Oh, ok. Um... And then...?"
35767,Stefan, And then I pulled away. Then I put it together. She wasn't you. I gotta go
35768,Liv," I mean, you gotta admit, it was pretty rad. I locked a vampire in her dorm with an invisible seal. I mean, how many newbie witches have that on their resume?"
35769,Bonnie," If they do, they don't brag about it as loudly"
35770,Liv," Come on. This place is dead. Like serious spring break-hiatus. Besides, you're not even a little proud of me?"
35771,Bonnie," Ok, hot sh*t. Set it on fire"
35772,Liv, What?
35773,Bonnie, Simple fire spell
35774,Liv, Ok
35775,Liv, That's weird
35776,Bonnie, Guess your resume still needs a little padding
35777,Aaron," Hey, it's Aaron. Leave me a message, or don't. Whatever"
35778,Elena," Hey, Aaron, it's Elena. I… ahem. I hope that you're off on some private island somewhere enjoying your spring break. Look, a lot has happened... And I'd really like to talk about it. If you're still willing to talk to me. So, call me back, ok? All right. Bye"
35779,Katherine, Dear diary. I love my life. Seriously. Becoming Elena Gilbert is the best thing that has ever happened to me
35780,Elena," Oh, my God"
35781,Katherine," Spent the day on the road with Stefan, although the highlight was our little pit stop at the hotel. I had to wash up after ""accidentally"" getting grease on my shirt"
35782,Katherine," Oh, well. I didn't like this shirt anyway"
35783,Stefan," Ahh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Warning the next time?"
35784,Katherine, It's nothing you haven't seen before
35785,Stefan, I know. I'm just saying there's a bathroom less than 10 feet away
35786,Katherine," You know, that's what I like about you, Stefan. Always a gentleman. You don't have to turn away, you know. There's nothing stopping us. We're both single now. And we're alone"
35787,Elena," Stefan, it's not me. It's Katherine, Stefan. She's seducing you. Stop"
35788,Stefan, What are you doing?
35789,Elena," This isn't me, Stefan.Can't you tell? After everything we've been through… I wouldn't lead you on like that"
35790,Elena, Damon?
35791,Damon," Stefan, Stefan, Stefan. ""I have grease on my shirt. I need to wash up""? Come on, man, that's the oldest trick in the book"
35792,Stefan, It's not like you saw through her
35793,Damon, I wasn't the one making out with her
35794,Elena," Stop it, ok? Both of you. This is what she wants. Even dead, she is ruining our lives"
35795,Stefan," Oh, you think this is bad? You have no idea, do you?"
35796,Elena," About what? About what, Stefan?"
35797,Elena, What the hell is happening to me?
35798,Stefan, He'll tell her
35799,Caroline, When?
35800,Stefan," ""Hey, Elena, I k*ll Aaron."" It's not exactly casual conversation"
35801,Caroline, k*ll someone in cold bl*od isn't casual but Damon managed that just fine
35802,Enzo, Or I can just tell her. Considering I was lying in the road when he stopped his car
35803,Stefan," So, what's in this for you? Aside from getting Damon to undo every positive decision he's ever made?"
35804,Enzo," Is it such an anomaly for Damon to have a friend? Well, if so, consider me honored"
35805,Caroline," Ok, we're here. Where is the antidote?"
35806,Stefan, Who are you?
35807,Sloan," I'm Sloan, and you met some of the Travelers when they were taking a bucket of your bl*od"
35808,Stefan," Oh, yeah. How could I forget? So, you have the antidote to this ripper virus, correct?"
35809,Sloan," We do, thanks to Enzo"
35810,Enzo," I was trapped in that bloody farm house with Damon. Set to have my head torn off when out of nowhere Wes, with the help of the Travelers, saved my life. On the condition I owed him one"
35811,Caroline, What does that have to do with us?
35812,Enzo," He was running low on vampires, and he needed one to continue his work, so I let him experiment on me. Among other things, it allowed him to make an antidote."
35813,Stefan, Fine. When will it be done?
35814,Sloan, First we have to find something
35815,Stefan, Ok. What do you need?
35816,Sloan, Another one of you
35817,Damon, What do you mean werewolf venom?
35818,Elena," I mean, I'm deteriorating. Slowly. I seem to be hallucinating all my worst fears. So, that's been fun"
35819,Damon, I should come over there
35820,Elena," You can't. We would tear each other apart, remember? Besides, I… I look gross"
35821,Damon," Oh, yeah, well, never mind. Would be awful"
35822,Elena, Distract me
35823,Damon, All right. What are you wearing?
35824,Elena," Damon, come on. Tell me. What else have I missed?"
35825,Damon," Ok, ok, ok, let's see. Um...It's been unseasonably cold. Jeremy bought a bunch of new X-Box games that are ridiculously loud and obnoxious. Tyler had a party. It was lame. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Did you hear the gossip?"
35826,Elena, What gossip?
35827,Damon, Caroline and an original hybrid sittin' in a tree
35828,Elena, No!
35829,Damon, Yep
35830,Elena," Are you serious? Caroline and Klaus? Wait, does Tyler know about this?"
35831,Damon," Yup, and guess who told him"
35832,Elena, Katherine? Katherine is such a bitch
35833,Damon, That she is
35834,Elena, Sorry
35835,Damon, You ok?
35836,Elena, Um...I just don't understand why Stefan's off at some mystery location. Why don't we hunt down Wes and force him to make us an antidote?
35837,Damon, That's easier said than done. Wes is dead
35838,Elena, What?
35839,Damon, I k*ll him. Please don't act like he didn't deserve it
35840,Elena," What about Aaron, Damon? He didn't deserve that. Wes was pretty much the closest thing that Aaron had to a family"
35841,Damon," Soup's on. The highlight of my day.I will check on you later, ok?"
35842,Elena," Yeah. Yeah, ok"
35843,Stefan, What do you mean there is another one of me out there?
35844,Enzo," Ever stop to think there might be another doppelganger roaming around? Clearly, you don't know your Traveler lore"
35845,Caroline," I'm sorry, and you do?"
35846,Enzo," Having stuck with them for the past few weeks, I've picked up a few things. Like how the last remaining pair of doppelgangers are special"
35847,Caroline, Special how?
35848,Sloan, None of your business
35849,Enzo," You'll have to excuse Sloan. She's under a bit of stress. The leader of the Travelers… Marcus, was it?"
35850,Sloan, Markos
35851,Enzo," Markos. See, he wants the bl*od from the last remaining pair of doppelgangers, i.e., you and Elena"
35852,Caroline, Why?
35853,Enzo," Apparently, it's special"
35854,Stefan, Special how?
35855,Enzo," Don't think I didn't ask. As we've witnessed, the Travelers are very secretive. But what we do know is that until the last doppelganger's out of the picture, your bl*od, when mixed with Elena's, doesn't do squat"
35856,Stefan," So, what, you do a locator spell to find this guy and then you k*ll him?"
35857,Sloan, It's more of a linking spell
35858,Stefan," Last time a witch linked me to my doppelganger, she fried my brain and I lost my memory"
35859,Sloan, Then we better be careful
35860,Elena, Aaron?
35861,Aaron, Hey there
35862,Elena, I thought you were on spring break
35863,Aaron, Are you ok?
35864,Elena," I'm sick. It's a long story. Look, I really wanted to talk to you about everything, because the last couple weeks, I haven't been myself. Literally. Katherine Pierce has been inside my body and…"
35865,Aaron," Ooh. That would explain a lot, actually"
35866,Elena, Why? Did I do something?
35867,Elena, Why is none of your stuff here?
35868,Aaron, Because I'm not actually here
35869,Elena," What do you mean?Are you another hallucination? Are you dead? Did I do this to you? Aaron, tell me that I didn't k*ll you. Did I k*ll you?Tell me that I didn't k*ll you. Please. Please"
35870,Boy," Elena. Elena. Wow, Elena Gilbert.Get up you lush. I see someone started her spring break early"
35871,Elena, How did you get in here? I thought the door was closed
35872,Boy," David dumped my ass… at senor frog's, of all horrifying places. He thought I was cheating on him. So, I took the first flight out of Cancun and here I am"
35873,Elena, Do I know you?
35874,Luke," I'm Luke. We met at the Bitter Ball?You're very drunk. All right, let me shower off this airplane stench and we can drown our sorrows in rum runners"
35875,Elena, That doesn't sound like a good idea
35876,Luke," Do not tell me you and Stefan hooked up while I was gone? Whoa, are you ok?"
35877,Elena, I'm just so thirsty
35878,Luke," Ok. We'll get you some water, all right?"
35879,Elena, Don't touch me
35880,Luke, You need help
35881,Elena," No, what I need is to feed"
35882,Elena, Don't move. I need vampire bl*od
35883,Luke, What are you doing?
35884,Elena, I need to turn you. I'm sorry. What is that? What… what is it?
35885,Luke," Uh, my paranoid boyfriend thought they were hickies but it obviously is some kind of disgusting rash or something"
35886,Elena," Or your friend ""Elena"" was feeding on you. Listen to me. Forget this conversation. Go find Bonnie Bennett. Tell her to come here and bring the witch. I need to get out of here right now. Go! Run!"
35887,Elena," I don't know what's happening to me, Damon"
35888,Damon," I know. Look, you're sick. So, just try to relax"
35889,Elena," I feel like no one's telling me the truth, Damon. I can't tell what's real anymore"
35890,Damon, Stefan will be there really soon
35891,Elena," I did it, didn't I? I k*ll him"
35892,Damon, What?
35893,Elena, Aaron. That's what you're so afraid to tell me. Aaron. I k*ll him
35894,Damon," Listen, Elena, I will tell you everything, but right now is not the time"
35895,Elena," Now is not the time, Damon? I'm dying. I almost turned a student today that Katherine apparently befriended just so that I could feed on him. When would a good time be, huh?"
35896,Damon," Listen, Elena, whoa, whoa. Calm down. Listen to my voice. You will get through this. I will help you"
35897,Elena," No. No, no, no, no… you're lying. You're lying!"
35898,Damon," Elena, calm down, please"
35899,Elena, Why is everyone lying to me? You're lying to me. Why is everyone lying to me? Why is everyone lying to me?
35900,Damon," Donovan! Donovan, get your ass in here!"
35901,Matt, Chill. I'm right here. What?
35902,Damon, Phone's dead. Charge it for me
35903,Matt, Too much sexting with Elena?
35904,Damon, How about you never say that again
35905,Matt," Damon, stop. Jeremy!"
35906,Jeremy, Whoa! What the hell?
35907,Damon, I need to see your sister. Undo my chains or I'll k*ll him
35908,Jeremy, I can't. You'll k*ll her
35909,Damon," She's gonna hurt herself, Jeremy. She's totally unraveling"
35910,Matt," Don't do it, Jeremy"
35911,Damon," Don't be an idiot, Jeremy. Trust me. She needs me. I would never hurt her, Jeremy"
35912,Caroline," Look, I know there's a lot of them, but between you, me, and Enzo, I bet we can take them"
35913,Stefan, Did you really just say that?
35914,Caroline, Sorry. I'm desperate
35915,Stefan, It'll be fine
35916,Caroline," Yeah, until you lose your memory again"
35917,Stefan," Well, if I lose my memory, then I won't remember I had anything to worry about in the first place. V"
35918,Caroline, Who volunteers themselves for witchy electric shock therapy?
35919,Stefan," Me, and I would do it for you, too. Look, let's just say that they do fry my brain…"
35920,Caroline, I'll k*ll them
35921,Stefan," Right, and then you'll spiral out of control about k*ll them. And then, do me a favor. Remind me, we were friends"
35922,Sloan, That's for you. Sit
35923,Stefan, Where are the antidotes?
35924,Sloan, You'll get it when we're done
35925,Stefan," No, you'll hand them over right now. I'm here. I'm doing everything you want me to"
35926,Enzo," I'll take them. I'll make sure the appropriate parties get them. If you don't trust me, you're welcome to join, goldilocks"
35927,Caroline," No, I want to stay with Stefan"
35928,Enzo, Very well. Best of luck
35929,Caroline," Wait, you said that you weren't gonna hurt him"
35930,Sloan," No, I said I'd try not to hurt him. We need his bl*od for the spell"
35931,Stefan, Wait a second. Tessa didn't need my bl*od when she linked me to Silas
35932,Sloan, Good for her. We do
35933,Bonnie," Elena, what are you doing?"
35934,Elena, I'm cleansing myself of anything that Katherine touched. Toothbrush. My clothes. My sheets
35935,Bonnie," Elena, stop. You're not yourself"
35936,Elena," That's ironic, because I wasn't myself for weeks, and yet nobody noticed"
35937,Lexi, She's losing it
35938,Elena," Are you Liv? I'm sorry if we've met before, but I'm really gonna need you to drop this seal and let me out right now"
35939,Bonnie, It's too dangerous for you to be out in public when you're sick
35940,Elena," You think that's dangerous, Bonnie? If you don't drop this seal right now, I will k*ll you"
35941,Bonnie," Elena, stop. This is the virus. It's in your head. Katherine wanted to destroy you, and it's working. You have to fight it"
35942,Elena," Oh, my God. You're right. You're right, Bonnie. You're right. I can't… I'm letting her win. I'm letting her win. I can't let her win. I'm not gonna let her win"
35943,Bonnie," Uhh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
35944,Elena," You will die if I don't give you my bl*od to heal you, so, you're gonna have to drop the seal. Otherwise, you're gonna bleed to death. So, hurry. It's your choice"
35945,Caroline, Why is this taking so long?
35946,Sloan, Just a little deeper. I see him. He's in a city
35947,Stefan, He's in Atlanta
35948,Caroline, Good. That's great. You found him
35949,Sloan, Keep going. Push harder
35950,Caroline, You said that you know where he is. What are you doing?
35951,Sloan, I'm not done. The link is strong enough. We need more information
35952,Caroline, You're pushing him too hard! He's gonna lose everything. Stop!
35953,Sloan, We need the doppelganger dead. Louder!
35954,Sloan," If you hurt me, they'll k*ll you"
35955,Caroline, Tell them to stop. There's a way we can all get what we want
35956,Aaron, Elena?
35957,Elena," Oh, my God. Aaron? Are you alive?"
35958,Aaron, You don't look so hot
35959,Elena," No. No, I'm good. I'm good now. I'm good now. I thought… I thought I k*ll you. I didn't k*ll you. You're right here. Oh! You're still alive"
35960,Damon, It's me. It's Damon. Hey. You're hallucinating. Here. Drink this. It's Stefan's bl*od. Drink this
35961,Elena, She won. Katherine won
35962,Damon, Don't say that
35963,Elena," Look at me, Damon. Look at me. Look at me. The plague of Katherine Pierce lives on. She's turning me into something that I'm not. Look at me. I'm a monster. Liv, the witch, I almost k*ll her. And my friends, I mean, I want to k*ll my friends. I think… I think if I k*ll my friends…"
35964,Damon, Come here. It's ok
35965,Elena," No, it's not ok! It's not ok, Damon. I k*ll Aaron Whitmore"
35966,Damon, No...No
35967,Elena, He keeps...following me everywhere. I'm hallucinating that Aaron's around here
35968,Damon," Elena, look at me. Hey, look at me. You did not k*ll Aaron Whitmore. I did"
35969,Elena, What? Why? W… was it because of the virus? Did you need to turn him?
35970,Damon," It was before I was infected. Listen, if you want specifics, it was the night that I thought that you broke up with me, Elena. I k*ll him to convince myself that you were right. That I was the type of person who could k*ll in cold bl*od, and I was never gonna change. That's why. I need you to say something"
35971,Elena, Why is Enzo here?
35972,Enzo," Sorry to interrupt, but I have the antidote. Although from the looks of it, you'd both rather be dead"
35973,Caroline, Hi
35974,Stefan, Rebekah. Hi
35975,Caroline," Oh, my God"
35976,Stefan, I'm kidding
35977,Caroline, It was funnier the first time
35978,Stefan, Did it work?
35979,Enzo," Engine's running, blondie. Appreciate the call. Let's go do this thing"
35980,Stefan, Did I miss something?
35981,Caroline," Sloan was gonna fry your brain in order to k*ll your other you. I wasn't about to let that happen, so, I may have volunteered to help Enzo deal with it"
35982,Stefan," You mean...k*ll him. Caroline, I can't let you…"
35983,Caroline," They only want one alive, remember? It's you or him"
35984,Stefan," All right, fine, well, I'm coming with you"
35985,Enzo," No, mate, you aren't. They need to use you to keep track of him. Tick-tock, gorgeous. Time is of the essence"
35986,Caroline," I'll be fine, Stefan. Besides, you'd do the same for me, right?"
35987,Stefan, I don't trust him
35988,Caroline," Don't worry. I don't, either. I'll be safe. I promise"
35989,Liv, Guess we should donate my shirt to Elena's fire cleanse
35990,Bonnie, I'm so sorry about all this
35991,Liv," Hey, I survived my first vampire attack. I mean, it's just one more thing to add to the resume"
35992,Bonnie," Look, if you don't want any part of this, I get it. Magic isn't for everyone. I won't be offended"
35993,Liv, No. I want this. And I want you to teach me
35994,Bonnie, Good. Then I'll see you tomorrow bright and early for some levitation
35995,Liv, Awesome. Catch you tomorrow
35996,Luke, Show off
35997,Liv," Luke, what the hell? I was about to take my shirt off"
35998,Luke," Relax. I'm gay and your brother, so technically, you're the least attractive person in the world to me. Are you ok? I'm sorry I had to drag you into this, but Elena thought she was compelling me and I couldn't give up the ruse"
35999,Liv," I'm fine. After Elena gutted me, she gave me some of her bl*od"
36000,Luke, And how is our precious anchor to the other side?
36001,Liv, I'm letting her think she's teaching me magic. It's kind of cute
36002,Luke," Until she realizes her friends are in jeopardy. Then, not so cute"
36003,Elena, No
36004,Damon, She speaks. churning around in that beautiful head of yours?
36005,Elena, You should have noticed
36006,Damon, What?
36007,Elena, That I was Katherine. That Katherine was me. You should have been the one that noticed
36008,Damon, You don't think I know that?
36009,Elena," If only you'd seen through her, Damon... There would be no vampire virus. Aaron would still be alive…"
36010,Damon, Katherine didn't do this. I did. I thought you broke my heart so I ripped open Aaron's neck. That is how much control you have over me
36011,Elena, And I'm still here. That's how much control you have over me
36012,Damon," Listen to us. This is toxic. We are in a toxic relationship, Elena. I just k*ll your friend and you find someone else to blame"
36013,Elena," You want me to blame you? Easy. Done. You screwed up, Damon. Again"
36014,Damon, Thank you!
36015,Elena, You put me in a position where I have to defend you. Again. Where I have to bend my morals. Again. Where I have to go against every single thing that I believe in. Again! Because I love you
36016,Damon, Then stop loving me
36017,Elena, I can't!
36018,Damon," Well, that's the problem. We don't work!"
36019,Elena, I know
36020,Damon, Then we agree. This has to end
36021,Elena, It just did It's over. We're over
36022,Doppelganger," What's your name, huh? My name's Tom. You're gonna be all right"
36023,Sloan, His name is Tom Avery. I heard that much
36024,Tom, Pneumothorax. I need a 10-guage needle now
36025,Doctor, We'll take it from here
36026,Tom," If you don't do it now, she's not gonna make it to the operating table"
36027,Sloan," Come on, Stefan. I need your help with the link. Tell me what you see. Tell me where to find your doppelganger"
36028,Doctor," You're a piece of work, Avery. They must have broke the mold when they made you"
36029,Stefan, Atlanta Metropolitan Hospital
36030,Sloan, Good. Now your friends can go k*ll him
36031,Damon," Morning, sunshine"
36032,Elena, Oh. Um... Did I wake you?
36033,Damon, No. I've been up for 3 hours
36034,Elena, Really? Because you didn't say a word
36035,Damon, Neither did you
36036,Elena," Well… ahem… that's because I didn't really have much to say.Nothing's changed. We're still bad for each other, and we are still broken up. Last night was a mistake"
36037,Damon, Maybe we should keep making mistakes. Big ones
36038,Elena," Seriously, Damon, put some clothes on or at least get out of my way. I need to go"
36039,Damon, Your loss. I make one hell of a naked breakfast
36040,Enzo, Atlanta assassination squad. How may we be of service?
36041,Sloan, I take it you haven't located the doppelganger yet
36042,Enzo," You told us to find a nameless paramedic at the scene of a car accident in a city full of freeways, fried green tomatoes, and terrible drivers. It's not exactly as easy as it sounds"
36043,Sloan," Which is why I'm calling. The doppelganger's name is Tom Avery, and I just saw him deliver a patient to Atlanta Metro Hospital"
36044,Caroline, She saw him? She did the vision thing again? We had a deal. I find Stefan's last living doppelganger…
36045,Sloan, Tom
36046,Caroline," Tom. I take care of Tom, and in return, you stop using Stefan to psychically b*mb him because every time you link the two, you are frying Stefan's brain"
36047,Sloan," I don't give a damn about his brain. It's his bl*od that matters, and until Stefan and Elena are the last two doppelgangers on earth, their bl*od is useless to me, so you better believe that I will give Stefan a back-alley lobotomy if you fail to k*ll Tom Avery"
36048,Caroline," Well, I don't fail at things, so do it again and I'll k*ll you, too"
36049,Enzo," ""I'll k*ll you, too."" You're like a perky blond angel of death. Almost had me convinced"
36050,Tyler, Breakfast of champions
36051,Matt, Let me guess. This is about Elena
36052,Damon," You know, that is so incredibly insightful, Donovan. You are really street smart from working behind that bar for… what is it… 3 years now?"
36053,Tyler, At least he's not looking for answers at the bottom of a glass
36054,Damon, Tyler Lockwood's now a life coach despite running his own life into the ground. Perfect
36055,Matt," If you wanted advice, why didn't you just talk to Stefan?"
36056,Damon, Because it's difficult to explain to your brother that you just broke up with the former love of his life and then broke the bed 
36057,Tyler, Who TMI
36058,Damon," Besides, I've got you two idiots, Mystic Falls' amateur therapists"
36059,Matt, I'm only listening to you because I'm getting paid
36060,Damon," Less and less by the second. Anyway, Stefan's not an option. He's off doing some research project with Caroline. Don't worry, wolf boy. I'm sure they're just friends"
36061,Liv," Bottle of gin, and let me see you break the seal. What can I say? I got issues"
36062,Damon," Whoa! Pull up a chair, girl. Tell the professionals your problems. Just talk slow and use small words"
36063,Liv," Thanks, but never, ever. Bye"
36064,Damon," Well boys, I hate to cut the session short but unlike you, I have other places to be today. Don't worry. I will be back because I have some deep, dark childhood trauma that I'm just itching to talk about"
36065,Guidance Counselor," As the guidance counselor, you'll first meet with me individually, and then you'll have an open house with your child's teachers"
36066,Elena," Hey, Bon"
36067,Bonnie, Hey. I got your text.What's the friend emergency?
36068,Elena, Damon and I broke up.It's final
36069,Bonnie," Oh, my God. When did it happen?"
36070,Elena, Last night
36071,Bonnie, But you didn't come home last night
36072,Elena," Uh, that's because I slept with him"
36073,Bonnie, Oh
36074,Elena, Post breakup
36075,Bonnie, Ohh
36076,Elena, Was that irresponsible?
36077,Bonnie, Probably. Does Jeremy know that you and Damon definitely maybe broke up?
36078,Elena, No. He wasn't at the house last night thankfully
36079,Bonnie," Well, that's weird. I mean, he didn't mention anything to me. If he wasn't at home, where was he?"
36080,Elena," I don't know. That doesn't really help with the whole irresponsible thing, does it? Bonnie?"
36081,Bonnie, Sorry. Katherine's cute BFF just showed up
36082,Elena, I think his name is Luke
36083,Bonnie, I have an idea. Since you and Damon are officially over...
36084,Elena," Nice try, but, um, I'm pretty sure Damon is more of his type"
36085,Bonnie," They'd be cute, too"
36086,Elena," Ha! Oh, look, Bonnie. I have to go. Thanks for listening"
36087,Elena," Hey, Mrs. Douglas"
36088,Mrs. Douglas," Elena, it's good to see you"
36089,Elena," You, too"
36090,Mrs. Douglas, Although you're not on the list as Jeremy's primary contact
36091,Elena, Then who is?
36092,Damon, Damon Salvatore. Present. Pardon me
36093,Caroline, Thanks
36094,Caroline," So the receptionist doesn't know Tom personally, but I compelled her to call someone who does"
36095,Enzo, Ok. I give up. I can't tell if you're avoiding the mission or me
36096,Caroline," Well, why can't it be both?"
36097,Enzo, Because I've earned some company after hand-delivering the antidote that kept Damon and Elena from consuming each other literally
36098,Caroline, That doesn't mean I trust you. I still don't understand why you're even here
36099,Enzo," Damon's trying to be a good boy these days, which means I'm in need of a new m*rder buddy. I'm joking. I joke. British humor. Ah. Modern women, all bosoms, no mystery, present company excluded"
36100,Caroline, Dear God! Please don't tell me that I'm the real reason that you're here
36101,Enzo," Why not? From what Damon tells me, I am your type… well-traveled, charming accent, dodgy morals"
36102,Caroline," Arrogant, tactless, completely unable to take a hint"
36103,Enzo," Precisely. I have to be honest, you remind me of someone I once knew. She worked for the Augustine’s"
36104,Caroline, Which means she tortured you. I can definitely relate to that
36105,Enzo, Maggie was only there to observe my behavior in captivity. I quite liked her actually
36106,Caroline, Let me guess. She made you want to be a better man
36107,Enzo, Not at all. She just reminded me that I was good all along
36108,Doctor, You were asking about Tom Avery?
36109,Caroline," Yes. We need to see him as soon as possible. It's, uh… it's a matter of life and death"
36110,Doctor," I wish I could help. Tom Avery was a pain in my ass, but he was also the best paramedic I ever met"
36111,Enzo," What do you mean ""was""?"
36112,Doctor, He disappeared 4 months ago
36113,Stefan, We moved. Why?
36114,Sloan, They don't call us Travelers for our mileage points
36115,Stefan, I know this place. We're right outside of Mystic Falls
36116,Sloan," Believe me, I'd rather be at the beach right now, but this is where we're supposed to meet our fearless leader"
36117,Stefan," Markos, right? You said he wants our bl*od. Why?"
36118,Sloan, I hope you're calling to tell me the doppelganger's dead
36119,Caroline, Your stupid doppelvisions gave us bad information. Put Stefan on the phone
36120,Stefan," Caroline, what happened?"
36121,Caroline," Tom has been missing from the hospital for months. Is there any other things that you noticed in your visions, any small details that could maybe help us out?"
36122,Stefan," No. I… I can't remember anything. After the spell happened, it's like I blacked out"
36123,Sloan," The link connects us to the doppelganger's mind. If we're seeing old memories, that means we have to go deeper"
36124,Caroline," No, no, no. If he's blacking out, that means that the link is destroying his memories. Stefan? Stefan. Stefan, are you still with me? Stefan, I'm still here.Listen to my voice. Can you hear me? I'm right here, ok? Just hold on"
36125,Woman, Excuse me? Hi. Are you Tom Avery?
36126,Tom," The one and only.What can I do for you, miss, uh…"
36127,Woman," Hazel, and you already did it actually. It's my friend Trish.The doctor said you saved her life last night."
36128,Tom," Eh, I was just doing my job"
36129,Hazel," Can I buy you dinner to thank you, I mean? Oh, God. I am so bad at this"
36130,Tom, How's 7:00?
36131,Hazel," Perfect. You can pick me up at 6643 Peachtree Drive, hopefully not in an ambulance"
36132,Caroline," Can you hear me? Just say something, please"
36133,Stefan," Caroline, I'm here. 6643 Peachtree Drive. It was a red-haired woman, and her name's Hazel"
36134,Caroline, Ok. Thank you. I won't let you down
36135,Stefan," Caroline, he's a good person. Don't do it"
36136,Sloan, Clock's ticking
36137,Damon, Clock's busted. What am I paying my PTA dues for? I am gonna file a complaint
36138,Elena, Is that why you're here?
36139,Damon, You left me in charge of Jeremy when you went off to Whitmore. I've had this on my calendar for months
36140,Elena, Really? So no other reason?
36141,Damon," Why? Is there something else you want to talk about? Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you're not still tingly from this morning"
36142,Elena," Can we just focus on Jeremy, please?"
36143,Damon," Right. Ok. Well, speaking of hypotheticals, if Jeremy was running around with another girl, would you want to know about it?"
36144,Elena, What are you talking about? What girl?
36145,Damon, Bonnie's little witch trainee Liv. I saw her and Jeremy sharing a top-shelf bottle of inhibition k*ll at the grill this morning
36146,Elena, Jeremy wouldn't do that to Bonnie
36147,Damon," Again. Need I remind you, he once had an affair with a ghost? And the only thing that was missing was a sappy love song and a pottery wheel"
36148,Elena, He learned his lesson. Jeremy's not a cheater
36149,Mrs. Douglas," Ok. Sorry to keep you waiting. Bad news first.Jeremy's missed 11 days of school. He started 3 fights, and he's been caught cheating in math class twice"
36150,Damon," Cheating? That's so not like him.Go on, please"
36151,Mrs. Douglas, I'm sorry. You are Elena's…
36152,Damon," Ex-boyfriend…ex, right?"
36153,Elena, Can we not talk about this right now?
36154,Mrs. Douglas," Actually, it's relevant. Most problems in school are rooted in problems at home. Jeremy's in desperate need of a stable living situation. People who care about giving him that more than their own needs…"
36155,Damon, I think he's in desperate need of a less judgy counselor
36156,Elena," We do care, we really do. We'll... We'll do better"
36157,Mrs. Douglas, I hope so for Jeremy's sake
36158,Enzo, It's a miracle we found the place. Every other street in this blasted city is Peachtree
36159,Caroline," These look old. Like, 4 months old"
36160,Enzo," 70 years in a cage, think I'd have learned to pick a lock by now"
36161,Caroline, Red hair. That's her. She's a witch. And she must own the house
36162,Enzo, Not for long
36163,Caroline, Why did you do that? She was our only lead
36164,Enzo," Exactly, and I am a m*rder vampire. Surprise!"
36165,Bonnie, Hey. Hey. Can I help you?
36166,Luke, Oh. Huh?
36167,Bonnie, You just keep looking over there. I thought maybe you wanted to say something
36168,Luke," Oh, no. No. I'm just studying unless you're an expert in wave mechanics"
36169,Bonnie, Mmm. Science isn't really my thing
36170,Hazel," You're the anchor. If I'm here, that means I'm dead. Tell him I failed. Tell him I was trying to hide the doppelganger with magic, but they found us"
36171,Bonnie, What are you talking about? Who are you?
36172,Hazel, Hazel. He'll know the rest
36173,Luke," Oh. Hey, hey, hey. Are you ok?"
36174,Bonnie, She said she knew you. How did she know you?
36175,Luke, Who?
36176,Bonnie, Someone named Hazel. She had a message for you
36177,Jeremy, What the hell is a silencing spell?
36178,Liv, Just a little bit of magic. It keeps nosey hybrid types from snooping
36179,Tyler, So what's up with those two?
36180,Matt," Cliff notes… Liv goes to Whitmore, she's a new witch,and Bonnie's teaching her magic"
36181,Tyler," You left out the part about her being hot. Like, weird hot"
36182,Matt," You're the one with, you know, vamp ears. What are they talking about?"
36183,Tyler, I have no idea. I can't hear anything
36184,Liv, You're here because you're a hunter. That means that you can't be mind-controlled by Travelers. That officially makes you the only person in this room that I can trust
36185,Jeremy, Ok. So trust me. Tell me what's going on
36186,Liv, There's a rumor going around in witch circles. The Travelers are up to something big
36187,Jeremy, I thought Travelers were witches
36188,Liv," Not quite. They're more like the ugly stepsister. Travelers have a grudge against anyone that draws their magic from nature, something about witches cursing the land to turn it against them. Now they're on the move. Next stop… here"
36189,Jeremy, Mystic Falls? Why?
36190,Liv," Your sister. Turns out Elena's friends are right. The world actually does revolve around her, so if you want to keep her safe, you're gonna have to help me figure out what the Travelers are up to"
36191,Jeremy, Is everything ok?
36192,Liv, It will be
36193,Jeremy," Wait. You lay all this on me, and now you're just leaving?"
36194,Liv, You were plan A. Plans change
36195,Tyler," It's rude to leave Jeremy hanging, even for a newbie witch"
36196,Liv," Motus! Not a newbie witch, FYI"
36197,Elena, Just because Jeremy's a bad student doesn't meant that he's cheating on Bonnie
36198,Damon," You're making excuses for someone you love. That's what you do. The worst the behavior, the more you try and defend"
36199,Elena, And you keep trying to make this about us
36200,Damon," Yeah, because you keep trying to make it about anything else"
36201,Elena," You know what? Fine. But don't pretend that you came here for Jeremy. If you want to talk about last night, talk"
36202,Damon," Here's the thing, Elena. I don't know what to say or do or think. All I know is that right now I want to rip your clothes off right here in the middle of this hall and throw you in one of these classrooms and kiss every square inch of your body while a bunch of people that drive minivans listen, wishing they were us. That's probably a bad idea, right?"
36203,Elena, Right
36204,Damon, Right
36205,Elena, See you in class
36206,Enzo," She was in a bloody trance, unable to answer questions. I don't see why you're mad. I'm only doing what's necessary to save your friend because you won't"
36207,Caroline, You don't think that I'm up for this?
36208,Enzo, This being the cold-blooded m*rder of an innocent man? You can hardly say the word. How do you expect to actually do it?
36209,Caroline," I'm sorry. Is this all supposed to be easy? You barely know me, so let me reintroduce myself. Hi. My name is Caroline Forbes, and I am a good vampire, and I don't just go around k*ll people"
36210,Enzo," You've got me all wrong, Caroline Forbes. I'm not judging you. I'm preparing you. I've seen soldiers, men trained to k*ll, look their enemy in the eye and freeze up on the battlefield, a hesitation that usually cost them their lives"
36211,Caroline," Well, last time I checked, this isn't w*r, and I'm not a soldier, but Stefan is one of the best people that I know, and when it comes to saving his life, yes, I will do just about anything… What's that sound?"
36212,Enzo, The tell-tale heart
36213,Enzo, Why would a witch go to such lengths to keep a man alive and off the grid for 4 months?
36214,Caroline," 4 months ago, Silas died, the original Stefan-ganger"
36215,Enzo," He's a dead ringer all right, or rather, soon to be dead"
36216,Caroline, Tom? Tom? Tom Avery?
36217,Enzo," Caroline, let me do this. Just walk away now, go upstairs…"
36218,Caroline," No, no. I'm the one who made the deal. This is on me no matter what"
36219,Enzo, Or maybe you just can't stand the thought of putting Stefan's life in anyone's hands but your own
36220,Tom, What's happening? Who are you people?
36221,Enzo," We're angels, mate, come to deliver you to the sweet hereafter"
36222,Caroline, Calm down. You can trust me
36223,Enzo, Bonding with him will only make it harder on you
36224,Caroline," Let me do this my way. I'm your friend, and you mean the world to me. Do you trust me?"
36225,Tom, Of course
36226,Caroline," Good. Now I promise, you won't feel a thing"
36227,Tom, What's going on?
36228,Caroline, I'm getting you out of here
36229,Bonnie, So you're Liv's twin brother and a witch? Anything else I should know?
36230,Luke," Look. Please don't be mad at Liv, ok? My family's kind of messed up"
36231,Bonnie, I'm not mad. I'm creeped out. Why have you been watching me all day? We're not done
36232,Bonnie, Hey Jer
36233,Jeremy, Is Elena with you? I think she's in trouble
36234,Bonnie," No. She's at your school today, remember?What's going on?"
36235,Jeremy, Liv is up to something. She said Elena is important to the Travelers
36236,Bonnie, Liv? Since when do you two talk?
36237,Jeremy," Look. I'll tell you everything later, but I got to go find Elena"
36238,Damon, Lucky us. First ones here
36239,Elena, Shut up
36240,Damon, You ok?
36241,Elena, Shh. I said no talking
36242,Damon," Elena. Elena. Hey, Elena. Elena. Elena. Earth to Elena"
36243,Teacher," I tell my students chemistry is about attraction and reaction. Sometimes, it's beautiful"
36244,Damon, Hey. You're missing an incredibly boring presentation
36245,Elena, I need some air
36246,Teacher," It's the more destructive reactions that your students are the most interested in, and that's the meaning of applied science"
36247,Liv, Elena Gilbert. Just the girl I'm looking for
36248,Elena, Liv? Hey. What are you doing here? Is this about Jeremy?
36249,Liv," No. This is about you.Sorry about this. My coven did everything in its power to protect you, but you're just too dangerous now"
36250,Elena, I don't know what you're talking about
36251,Liv, And you never will
36252,Elena, Oh god
36253,Damon," Little tip. If you're gonna show up to k*ll someone, don't waste time feeling bad about it"
36254,Tom," You know, Hazel seemed nice, so, you know; I figured why not have dinner? So I showered, I picked her up, and that was it. That was the last thing I remember for 4 months"
36255,Caroline," She kidnapped you that night, locked you up ever since and hid you away from anyone that knew magic"
36256,Tom," Oh. Like you said, she was a real witch"
36257,Caroline, Yeah
36258,Tom, I don't know why I'm telling you my whole life story
36259,Caroline, It's because I compelled you to and to stay calm and to not worry
36260,Tom, Hmm. Why do you want to know so much about me?
36261,Caroline," I just want to make sure that you're a good guy, no skeletons in the closet, that sort of thing"
36262,Tom, And?
36263,Caroline, And… You are just about one of the nicest people I have ever met
36264,Tom," Well, likewise because I do remember you saving my life, so if there's anything that I can do to repay you, let me know"
36265,Caroline," Uh, what I need from you isn't something I can take"
36266,Tom, I don't understand
36267,Caroline," Well, you don't have to. You just remind me of someone who's really important to me"
36268,Tom," Well, he's one hell of a lucky guy"
36269,Caroline," Heh. Yeah. So are you because after this, you're gonna get on the train, ride until you find a place that you like, meet a pretty girl, settle down, and be happy for the rest of your long, long life. Just go easy on the carbs. They're a k*ll"
36270,Elena, Enough!
36271,Damon," Hardly. She was two seconds away from k*ll you. I want to know why, so I am gonna rip this nasty rag out of your mouth. If I hear so much as one syllable of hocus-pocus, one of us is gonna break your neck. Spoiler alert… it's gonna be me. Talk. All right"
36272,Elena," Damon, stop!"
36273,Damon," You do not to get to tell me what to do anymore. We broke up, remember?"
36274,Elena, This is exactly why we broke up. Please tell me you understand that
36275,Liv," Oh, my God. Just k*ll me already"
36276,Damon," Tempting, but not until you talk"
36277,Liv," She's the last female doppelganger. After tonight, there might only be one male doppelganger, and if that happens, the Travelers will come for you, Elena, to use you. The witches can't let that happen"
36278,Damon," If it's between you or this psychopath, Elena, you know what I have to do"
36279,Elena," And if you do, then what? Am I supposed to hate you or resent you or forgive you?"
36280,Damon," Well, that's your choice. The only way you're gonna get to make it is if you are alive. Please tell me you understand that"
36281,Jeremy," Are you freaking kidding me? You want to k*ll Liv, you're gonna have to k*ll me, too"
36282,Luke, Who are you?
36283,Matt, Friends of Jeremy and Elena
36284,Tyler, Even Damon sometimes
36285,Matt," Oh, and don't forget Bonnie. She's the one who told us you might be here"
36286,Luke," Well, bl*od's thicker than water, and my sister's in there, so…"
36287,Tyler, Yeah. She showed us that trick before
36288,Jeremy," What are you waiting for, Damon? Go on. Wouldn't be the first time you k*ll me"
36289,Elena, Jeremy
36290,Damon," She tried to stake your sister, you idiot. She's gonna do it again"
36291,Jeremy," No, she won't. She is gonna help keep Elena safe. I will make sure of that"
36292,Damon, How? You can't even get a passing grade in penmanship
36293,Jeremy," Trust me, I won't let anyone hurt you"
36294,Elena," Jer, after all the things that you've been pulling at school, how could I trust you?You haven't exactly been making good decisions, ok?"
36295,Jeremy," How do you expect me to care about school when this is my life? How I mean, take a look around. It's not like I can bring my teachers a note saying, ""Hey. Sorry I missed class today. We were under a doppelganger invasion."" But I know what I'm doing. Please.Liv knows more about the Travelers than she's letting on"
36296,Elena," Let's go, Damon"
36297,Damon, You can't be serious
36298,Elena," I trust him, ok, and right now, I really need you to trust me"
36299,Liv, Where the hell were you?
36300,Luke, Look. We wouldn't even be here if you would have just k*ll Elena
36301,Liv, I was almost turned into an ashtray or whatever crap they make in wood shop. Thanks for the brotherly concern.
36302,Jeremy," So here's plan C. You're gonna protect Elena, and I'm gonna help you stop the Travelers"
36303,Luke, You realize this is an epic conflict of interest?
36304,Liv," Maybe not. Jeremy's got hunter k*ll, and he's not afraid to take a stand. If the Travelers are coming for his sister or making a move on Mystic Falls or both, he's gonna see it coming before we do. So what's the catch?"
36305,Jeremy, I'm gonna need some help
36306,Luke, More townies. No
36307,Jeremy, They're part of the deal. Take it or leave it
36308,Tom, I don't think I've ever eaten so much in my life
36309,Caroline, Yeah. I don't think anyone has
36310,Enzo, Then I suppose it was a fitting last supper
36311,Caroline, No! Why the hell did you do that?
36312,Enzo, Because you're not the only one who cut a deal to save someone's life. That old flame I mentioned… Maggie… the Travelers claim they know where to find her
36313,Caroline," Yeah. Well, if she's anything like me, then she just lost all respect for you"
36314,Enzo," Then I'll earn her forgiveness in time because unlike you, Caroline, I'm willing to do whatever it takes for the people I love. The Travelers moved to some junkyard just outside Mystic Falls. Feel free to tell Stefan you're the one who saved his life"
36315,Damon, Penny for your thoughts
36316,Elena, I'm thinking Mrs. Douglas is right
36317,Damon, The guidance counselor? What the hell does she know about the crap that we're dealing with?
36318,Elena," She spelled it out for us, Damon. It's not that we're bad for each other. We're bad for Jeremy"
36319,Damon," Jeremy's whole life is bad for Jeremy. You want to fix Jeremy, put him on a plane, get him out of town. We did what he wanted, remember? Against my better judgment, I might add"
36320,Damon," Man of the hour.Where you going, little Gilbert?"
36321,Jeremy, Matt and Tyler said I could stay at their place for a while
36322,Elena," What? No, Jer. You don't have to do that"
36323,Damon, Put the bags down. We'll talk about this in the morning
36324,Jeremy," No, we won't.I should have moved out a long time ago"
36325,Elena," Jeremy, I know things have been a little crazy lately…"
36326,Jeremy," You know that they're always gonna be crazy, and I need to figure out how to deal with crazy on my own. Right now, this is what's best for me, for all of us. I'm not asking for permission"
36327,Elena," Ok. I'll… I'll call every day, and I'll make sure to stay more involved"
36328,Caroline, Stefan? Hey
36329,Stefan, Hey. Are you…?
36330,Caroline," A big, fat failure? Yep, but on the bright side, I'm also exhausted and very cranky"
36331,Stefan, It's good to see you anyway. So you want to tell me what happened?
36332,Caroline," I just did. I failed. I couldn't k*ll him, Stefan, not even to save you"
36333,Stefan," You do realize that you're feeling guilty for not being able to k*ll somebody, right?"
36334,Caroline, No. I'm feeling guilty because you're still being held prisoner
36335,Stefan," Come on, Caroline. They were never gonna let me out. I'm too important to them"
36336,Caroline," Well, you're even more important now. Enzo k*ll Tom"
36337,Stefan," Yet another reason to hate Enzo, I guess"
36338,Caroline," God. I should have seen it coming, that whole flirty ""Oh, I'm so charming because I want to distract you"" thing. I practically invented that. What do we now?"
36339,Stefan, We go to sleep
36340,Caroline, What? That's heroic
36341,Stefan," Well, the hero part of my brain needs to recharge after, you know, being tortured all day while you were out flirting with yet another British man"
36342,Caroline, shut up. That's very funny
36343,Stefan," We gather our strength, wait for an opportunity, get the hell out of here together"
36344,Caroline," You knew.That's why you let me go because you knew the whole time, didn't you?"
36345,Stefan, I knew what?
36346,Caroline, That I couldn't do it
36347,Stefan," Not that you couldn't do it, that you wouldn't do it"
36348,Caroline, How?
36349,Stefan, Because that's what makes you you
36350,Damon, Something tells me you're not packing for our honeymoon
36351,Elena, I'm going back to campus
36352,Damon," You realize that you leaving doesn't solve anything, right? I mean, especially now that Jeremy's free and clear of our horrible influence"
36353,Elena, It's not about Jeremy. It's about us. It's not just that we're bad for each other. It's that when we're together we do bad things for each other. I can't live like that
36354,Damon, I'll drive you to Whitmore
36355,Elena," If you do that, then I'm gonna spend the entire car ride thinking about your hand next to mine, and even though I'll try, I won't be able to stop myself from taking it or from letting you kiss me, and we're never gonna get to where we need to go. We'll just end up back here where we started. That's why I need you to let me go. No, Damon"
36356,Damon, Travel safe
36357,Bonnie," Hey, Jer. Um, I haven't heard back. I have a million questions, so I miss you, and I'm a little confused, that's all. Call me?"
36358,Caroline, What the hell is that?
36359,Stefan, Those buckets… they're drinking my bl*od and Elena's
36360,Caroline," Oh, my God"
36361,Stefan, This is it. Here. Take my hand
36362,Stefan, Did you lose something?
36363,Elena," Uh, yes. It's a particularly mortifying page from my journal"
36364,Stefan," Ah. You, uh, censor your journal? Pretty sure that's against journal rules"
36365,Elena," And I'm pretty sure that you're not the journal police. Trust me, it's really bad"
36366,Stefan, I'm officially intrigued
36367,Elena, And I'm officially not kidding. Thank you.I'm Elena
36368,Stefan, I’m Stefan
36369,Caroline, You ok?
36370,Elena, Yeah. I just… I just had a really crazy dream
36371,Enzo," So you broke up. That I get. Then you slept together. Not smart, but again, I get it. Now here's where it gets a bit hazy for me. You went to a parent-teacher conference?"
36372,Damon, Jeremy was having some trouble at school
36373,Enzo," Right. Then the kicker. You offer to drive her back to campus, and she says she can't be around you. I mean, I'm just confused even thinking about it. Can't imagine how you feel"
36374,Damon, I'm fine. We're just taking some time apart
36375,Enzo," Yeah, of course. A friends phase, where you, her friend, watch as she moves on with her life, finds a new boyfriend, perhaps a nice gentleman from a fraternity… Chance or Brock"
36376,Damon, Does your mysteriously missing girlfriend know how insufferable you are? Maybe that's why you haven't found her. She doesn't want to be found!
36377,Enzo," I haven't found her because the Travelers, i.e. my only lead, decided to play a fun game of spontaneous combustion before giving me what they promised"
36378,Damon, Right. Now you're here annoying me
36379,Enzo," We could always go k*ll people, but I suppose that's what got you into this problem in the first place"
36380,Caroline," Well, I guess my mom's not here yet. I'm gonna get us some coffees"
36381,Elena, Sure
36382,Stefan, Here you go
36383,Elena, I'm gonna need these. I'm so clumsy
36384,Stefan," So, uh, you hated the movie, huh?"
36385,Elena, No. I didn't hate it. I just wasn't exactly paying attention either. So do you want to dinner some…
36386,Stefan," We should, uh, do this again sometime. Yeah"
36387,Elena, Sure
36388,Stefan, Good
36389,Elena," Sorry. That's my dad, waiting up for me. It's so embarrassing"
36390,Stefan, I'm really looking forward to dinner
36391,Elena," Me, too"
36392,Stefan, Good night
36393,Caroline, My mom's 5 minutes away.Elena?Hello? Elena!
36394,Elena, How did I get here?I was just standing at the doorway
36395,Caroline," Uh, you walked.Hang on. Did you just have one of those dreams like, right here?"
36396,Elena," It didn't feel like a dream, ok? It felt like it was real, like I was just there"
36397,Caroline, That's weird
36398,Elena," Caroline, if you bite your tongue any harder, you'll bleed. Say it"
36399,Caroline," It's Psych 101. Actually, it's whatever comes before 101. You told Damon that you couldn't see him anymore, and now you're having dreams about Stefan?"
36400,Elena," It's not just about Stefan, ok? My parents were still alive. It was like a different life"
36401,Caroline," Stefan, hey"
36402,Stefan, Hey
36403,Caroline, Is everything ok?
36404,Stefan," Well, you know how sometimes you feel crazy and you call me and I tell you that you're not crazy?"
36405,Caroline, Even though most of the time I am
36406,Stefan," Well, I need you to tell me that I'm not crazy"
36407,Caroline," Uh, no promises"
36408,Stefan," I was walking to my car, and I nearly got plowed over in the middle of the street because I was having some vision of Elena"
36409,Caroline," I take that back. Actually, you're not crazy at all. Something's going on"
36410,Jeremy, Hey. It's Jeremy. Leave a message
36411,Bonnie," Hey, Jeremy. It's me Bonnie Bennett, your girlfriend, just in case you need reminding, which I'm happy to keep doing until you call me back. So call me"
36412,Bonnie," Hey, grams"
36413,Sheila, I heard the Travelers did a number on you last night
36414,Bonnie," Did you read that in the other side newsletter? Grams, you don't look right"
36415,Sheila," Something's wrong over here, Bonnie. Some of the witches think that the Travelers tried to overwhelm you so that someone could get through"
36416,Bonnie, As in come back?
36417,Sheila," Whoever it is, he's hiding from us, and now this place is…"
36418,Bonnie, That wasn't creepy. What's going on over here?
36419,Sheila," I don't know, but whatever the Travelers did and whoever managed to get through, it's got the witches scared"
36420,Liv," The Travelers are here, and our goal is to get rid of them, but before I put my faith in the 3 Stooges, I need to make sure that none of you are harboring a passenger"
36421,Matt, So you want us to stab ourselves?
36422,Liv, This kn*fe is the only thing that will get rid of them
36423,Matt," Again, you want us to stab ourselves?"
36424,Jeremy, Just do it so we can get on with this
36425,Matt, Says the hunter with the Traveler-proof head
36426,Tyler, I'll do it
36427,Matt," And the hybrid, who heals"
36428,Tyler," Dude, you have a magic ring that brings you back from the dead. Quit bitching"
36429,Liv," Shoulder. Shouldn't hurt too much. Not too deep. I can help if you... So much testosterone, so few brain cells"
36430,Jeremy, Ok. So we're all in the clear. Want to tell us exactly what we're doing here?
36431,Liv," Easy. You just have to do that about a hundred more times, only to other people. Look. The truth is that my coven has been tracking the Travelers for thousands of years. They're always on the move, but there have been a few times in history when they have stopped to gather. Freaky part is that no one's ever noticed because one by one they've taken over towns by putting passengers inside the townsfolk. We think they're doing the same thing in Mystic Falls"
36432,Enzo," Care to lose again, or shall we move on to step two of Elenaless Damon?"
36433,Damon," You know, bringing up her name defeats the purpose of me trying to forget about her"
36434,Enzo, Bring up whose name? Elena
36435,Damon, Whatever
36436,Damon, Speak of the devil
36437,Caroline, Hey. Have you heard from my mom?
36438,Matt, No. Why?
36439,Caroline," Well, she was supposed to meet me here, and now she's not texting me back. If you see her, will you just let her know that something came up?"
36440,Matt," Yeah, of course"
36441,Caroline, Ok. Thanks
36442,Damon," Damon one, temptation zero"
36443,Enzo," Temptation one, Enzo…"
36444,Enzo," Hello, gorgeous"
36445,Caroline, Can you tell Damon that there's something going on with Elena and Stefan?
36446,Damon, What?
36447,Caroline," Well, you know how we all laughed off the notion that the universe is drawing Stefan and Elena together?"
36448,Damon, Yeah
36449,Caroline," Well, that's happening"
36450,Damon, What's happening?
36451,Caroline, Now that Stefan's doppelhim…
36452,Damon, Tom?
36453,Caroline," Tom, yes.Now that Tom is dead, Stefan and Elena are the last pair of doppelgangers, which might explain why Stefan and Elena are suddenly having vision-type situations of each other"
36454,Damon, Wait. What kind of visions?
36455,Enzo, You know what she's not telling you. Somebody's having sex dreams
36456,Elena, They're not sex dreams!
36457,Caroline, Yeah. They're more like romance dreams
36458,Damon, I don't need to know that. Where's Stefan?
36459,Caroline, He went to the Traveler camp to see if anyone's still there that can tell him what's going on
36460,Enzo," Yeah, good luck with that"
36461,Caroline," Well, it's our only lead. Look. All we know is that Tom is dead, the Travelers just committed a mass su1c1de, and now Stefan and Elena, who are clearly not together anymore, are having intense visions of each other"
36462,Damon," Find a witch, get her over here. Let's figure out what the hell's going on"
36463,Jeremy, Bonnie
36464,Bonnie," Surprise. Actually not really. I left you a voicemail, and I texted"
36465,Jeremy," Yeah, I know, I know. Sorry. I, um… I've just been busy moving and stuff"
36466,Bonnie," Right. All your stuff. Anyway, I need your help. I think something's going on on the other side"
36467,Jeremy, What do you mean?
36468,Bonnie," My grams says the witches are worried someone got out,and I thought since you could see ghosts…"
36469,Liv," Jeremy, come on. Back to work"
36470,Bonnie, Liv's here? Are you kidding me?
36471,Liv, It's not what it looks like. Jeremy hired me to help him with math
36472,Bonnie, Right. Was that before or after you lied to my face and tried to k*ll his sister? Tell me what's going on
36473,Jeremy," I can't. I'm sorry. We have this handled. I just… I need you to trust me, ok?"
36474,Jeremy, I told you I didn't want to keep any secrets
36475,Liv," Nothing personal, Jer, but sneaking up on the Travelers requires them not to know that we're doing it. I already broke my rule once for Matt and Tyler. I'm not doing it again"
36476,Tyler, Where are you now?
36477,Matt," Checking on the sheriff, but she's not here.I know it's probably nothing, but if I were gonna take over a town…"
36478,Tyler, You'd start at the top. Don't do anything stupid before I get there
36479,Matt," I can't do anything until you bring the Traveler kn*fe, so hurry up"
36480,Liz, Traveler kn*fe?
36481,Matt," Sheriff, hey"
36482,Liz, Who you talking to?
36483,Matt," Uh, Caroline. She said you missed lunch, so I told her I'd check up on you"
36484,Liz, You mentioned a Traveler kn*fe
36485,Matt, Did I? Maybe you misheard
36486,Liz, I didn't
36487,Bonnie, Matt? What are you doing here?
36488,Matt," I'm dead, Bon,but the sheriff's in trouble"
36489,Bonnie, What?
36490,Matt," Just tell Jeremy. He'll know what I mean. I'm sorry to do this to you, Bon"
36491,Matt, Can you see me? Are you a witch? Then how?
36492,Kol," It's all topsy-turvy over here, darling, but I've got to say it's good to be seen. Don't tell me you don't remember me. Kol, original vampire, m*rder pointlessly by Jeremy Gilbert"
36493,Matt," Yeah, I know who you are. I thought the whole point of this place was to live out your afterlife in solitude. Why can I see you?"
36494,Kol," Well, apparently there's trouble in paradise. The rumblings from the witches is that somebody tore his way out of here,and now this whole place is unraveling. Not that that matters to you. You're just on holiday, which means you're going back"
36495,Matt, Vicki
36496,Kol, Never heard of her
36497,Matt," She's my sister. She's over here. If I can see you, then that means I can see her"
36498,Enzo, I thought you were bringing a witch
36499,Caroline, We said we'd call her. We didn't say we'd pick her up
36500,Elena," So where's, uh… where's Damon?"
36501,Damon, Hi
36502,Elena, Hi
36503,Enzo, So who could use a drink from the library?
36504,Caroline," Yes, please"
36505,Elena," Well, at least they're not being obvious. You got a pool table"
36506,Damon, Yeah. I figured pool was a good outlet to put this pent-up energy that I seem to now have
36507,Elena," Yeah. I went running today, 10 miles. Could have gone 20"
36508,Damon, Yeah
36509,Caroline, Oh. This is so bad. They're fishing for small talk. We should do something
36510,Enzo, Or we could stay and let them amuse us as they resist the desire to tear each other's clothes off
36511,Damon, Drink?
36512,Elena, Probably not a good idea. Inhibitions and all
36513,Damon," Well, wouldn't want that"
36514,Elena, Can we not do this?
36515,Damon," We're not doing anything. I think that's part of the problem. We're just standing clothed, just standing, doing nothing"
36516,Elena," I mean, the whole strained, awkward, don't know how to act part. Can't we just be friends and do friendly things?"
36517,Enzo, Ouch! She used the f-word. Poor bastard
36518,Caroline, But I thought that's what this was
36519,Enzo," Oh, it is, but it was never explicitly stated until now"
36520,Caroline, And that matters because?
36521,Enzo," Well, because until it's officially out there, there's still hope, and hope… hope can trick you into all sorts of hilariously unrealistic scenarios"
36522,Caroline, You mean Maggie? So what happened?
36523,Enzo," Well, the Travelers forgot to tell me where Maggie was before they lit themselves on fire. Talk about a lead going up in smoke"
36524,Caroline," Yeah, but… and no offense… but even if she still was alive, wouldn't she be, like, really old?"
36525,Enzo," 70 years of captivity, and she was the face that I clung on to… the notion that one day I'd get out and see her again. I don't want to date her, Caroline. I want to thank her"
36526,Damon, So having sex dreams about my brother
36527,Elena," Wow! Ok. Yeah, that's definitely one way to change the subject"
36528,Damon," Well, I just thought I'd skip the uncomfortable parts"
36529,Elena," Yeah. Look. I don't know what the visions mean, Damon. It's just random snippets of Stefan and me living in some alternate reality"
36530,Damon," I'm gonna regret this, but... By any chance are fantasy Elena and fantasy Stefan really, really, really happy?"
36531,Elena, Um...
36532,Damon," Right. Well, as your friend, let me state the obvious that the prophecy says that you two are fated to be together. You're supposed to be together"
36533,Damon," We're all good on bibles, thanks"
36534,Luke," I'm Luke Parker, Liv's twin brother"
36535,Damon, Liv has a twin? Is it possible for there just to be one of someone around here?
36536,Elena, Where's Liv?
36537,Luke, Busy
36538,Damon, Come on in
36539,Tyler," Hey, Sheriff"
36540,Liz," Hey, Tyler. Staying out of trouble?"
36541,Tyler, Yeah. You know me
36542,Liz," I certainly do, and hybrids are not above the law, so do me a favor. Keep the day drinking at the grill on the D.L., please. It's bad for business"
36543,Tyler, Right. Will do
36544,Liz," Anyway, I'm running late"
36545,Tyler, My mom says hi
36546,Liz," Send her my best, ok?"
36547,Tyler, You're ok. You're safe now
36548,Damon, What do you mean you can't stop their visions?
36549,Luke, Our magic doesn't work like that. We're not bigger than the universe
36550,Damon, Then why are you are in my house?
36551,Luke, Because we need your help. We think the Travelers are about to make their move. Their leader Markos is here
36552,Damon, From where? Chant camp?
36553,Luke," The other side. He's been dead for centuries, and we think the fire sacrifice allowed him to escape"
36554,Elena," Perfect. A dead old guy with a mysterious, evil plan. I'll take that drink now"
36555,Caroline, Stefan just called. He said the scrap yard's been completely cleared out
36556,Damon, And let me guess… the witches don't know where Markos is
36557,Luke, You guys said the visions are trying to draw Elena and Stefan together for something
36558,Elena, For our doppelganger bl*od. The Travelers need it for some prophecy
36559,Luke," And if the Travelers are the ones who need your bl*od, doesn't it make sense that you're not only being drawn together but also..."
36560,Elena, Being drawn to them
36561,Damon," Well, this just keeps getting better and better"
36562,Caroline, Wait. I don't get it
36563,Enzo," If the visions are a road map, then we need more clues. Break out the popcorn, blondie. Elena's little sex romp isn't over yet"
36564,Elena, What are you doing out here?
36565,Damon," Aw, you know, looking at the stars, listening to the universe laugh at me"
36566,Elena, Damon…
36567,Damon," We were doomed from the beginning, Elena. We were always gonna end up here"
36568,Elena," Damon, they're just visions. As soon as we find Markos, they'll stop"
36569,Damon, And then what? We're friends? Can't wait
36570,Elena, Look. I know we're in a little bit of a weird place right now. Hey. Look at me. The universe doesn't control anything. It's not real
36571,Elena, You're really trying to pull off this chef thing
36572,Stefan," Yeah. Well, it's our anniversary, so, uh, no holding back"
36573,Elena," Well, if it turns out anything like your last 22 attempts, wine"
36574,Stefan, Mmm. Perfect
36575,Elena, I always forget. Where do we put the opener?
36576,Stefan," Oh. No, no, no. Not that drawer, not that one"
36577,Elena, Yes
36578,Stefan, You didn't even open it
36579,Elena, I don't have to
36580,Stefan, I love you
36581,Elena," I love you, too"
36582,Damon, Elena
36583,Elena, Did I just…?
36584,Damon, Yep
36585,Enzo," That good, eh?"
36586,Elena, He's here. I know where Markos is. 4620 Walnut Drive
36587,Matt, Vicki! Vick! How am I back here?
36588,Vicki, Matt!
36589,Matt, Vick?
36590,Vicki," Matty, I'm here"
36591,Matt, I'm here now. It's ok
36592,Vicki," No. Listen to me. It's not ok. Something's wrong.Look at this place. Matty, you need to get to your body and go back"
36593,Matt, I'm not leaving you again. We're getting out of here. Take my hand. Let’s go. Take my hand!Vicki! Vicki!Vicki! Vicki! I won't let you go!
36594,Vicki," Matt, I love you... But I'm already dead"
36595,Matt, Noooo! Vicki! Vicki! Vick!
36596,Damon, Huh. Clear
36597,Enzo," I wonder if this is where Stefan and Elena had crazy vision sex. Eh, it's probably the bedroom. Stefan's pretty vanilla, but apparently that's Elena's favorite flavor"
36598,Damon, I'm gonna staple your tongue to your chin
36599,Man," Not in my house, please"
36600,Damon," Markos I take it. Well, I'm not Stefan, and this is not Elena"
36601,Markos, Why are you here?
36602,Damon," I was about to ask you the same question. Plus, what do you want, and why are the doppelgangers having visions of each other?"
36603,Markos, First two are complicated. Last one's easy. I'm the reason Stefan and Elena are having visions of each other
36604,Damon, You?
36605,Enzo," Well, would you look at that. I think we just met the universe"
36606,Damon, You mind telling me what the hell is going on?
36607,Markos," Well, I'm afraid the doppelganger lore's been misinterpreted over the ages"
36608,Damon, As in there is no prophecy?
36609,Markos," The prophecy is that the doppelganger bl*od can help the Travelers, but they're being drawn together because of a spell I cast 1,500 years ago. I had no idea where they were, and it turns out the best way to get people to go searching for each other is the promise of true love. Is it stuffy in here?Why don't we take a walk? You stay here"
36610,Enzo, Not bloody likely
36611,Markos, You want to find Maggie? You stay here.Shall we?
36612,Markos, Mystic Falls is a beautiful town
36613,Damon," Oh, yeah.Picket fences, block parties, uncannily high death rate"
36614,Markos, You take your homes for granted
36615,Damon, I'm sorry. Are we walking so I don't fall asleep?
36616,Markos," 2,000 years ago, Silas and Qetsiyah cast a spell for immortality.It created a schism in the Traveler community, giving rise to the witches. They tried to keep us scattered to make us forget how powerful we can be"
36617,Damon," And thus began the w*r between the Travelers and the Witches, and it's still rages on and on. Sorry. I just nodded off"
36618,Markos," The witches put a curse on us that kept us from settling down as a tribe. Whenever we've tried to gather, disaster struck… plagues, earthquakes, fire. Something inevitably wiped us out"
36619,Damon, Let me guess… the doppelgangers can fix this. So you found them. Now what?
36620,Markos," We simply need their bl*od, but we're not your enemy, Damon, and to prove that to you, I'm gonna stop their visions. The curse might prevent us from gathering in our own bodies, but we've found ways around that"
36621,Damon, Passengers. So how many of you are there?
36622,Markos, A few... Here and there.Shall I continue?
36623,Radio, ...Winds that cool. Low temperatures expected
36624,Stefan," Hey. So I, um… I got your aunt Jenna a wine of the month thing. Think she'll like that?"
36625,Elena, The only thing I think she would have liked more would have been a wine of the day thing
36626,Stefan, Thank you
36627,Elena," Oh. I talked to Jeremy, and he's bringing a girl home this year"
36628,Stefan, Ooh. So is Damon
36629,Elena, Hmm. I'm sure they'll both be lovely
36630,Stefan," Liar. Hey, guys, share, please"
36631,Elena, Do you know that she bit him this morning?
36632,Stefan, Really? Nice
36633,Elena," Stefan, don't encourage that"
36634,Stefan, What? Everybody loves a biter
36635,Elena," Oh, yeah? I'll bite you"
36636,Stefan, Good. I'll bite you right back
36637,Markos, It's done
36638,Stefan, Elena
36639,Elena," Did you feel that, too?"
36640,Stefan, And then it just ended
36641,Elena, Does that mean that it's over?
36642,Stefan, Yeah. It's over
36643,Elena, They weren't real
36644,Stefan," It was a spell, showing us what we wanted to see"
36645,Elena," We weren't vampires,my parents were still alive. It was a fantasy, like a movie. It was the life that we never could have had"
36646,Stefan, But it still felt…
36647,Elena, Amazing?
36648,Stefan," Yeah. But, you know, the life that we had, I mean, that was amazing, too, and it wasn't a spell or a prophecy. It was real. We fell in love on our own. We had ups and downs, we fought"
36649,Elena, I died 
36650,Stefan," Yeah. We changed, both of us. We grew, and we grew apart, but that is real. I mean, that's life"
36651,Elena, You couldn't cook
36652,Stefan," And you could. Again, a fantasy. I'll always love you, Elena"
36653,Elena," I will always love you, too. Do you think Damon and I will ever be able to talk like this, like friends?"
36654,Stefan, I think you can either be friends with someone or in love with them. I don't think you can be both
36655,Kol," All right, then.Mourning time over. Chip-chop. Not to be insensitive, but she was already dead. Little bit of a grief k*ll, don't you think?"
36656,Matt, Where'd she go? Did she move on?Did she find peace? Because it certainly didn't look like that
36657,Kol," I don't know where she went, and honestly, I would love to never find out, which is why I need you back in your body, shouting from the rooftops about what happened here"
36658,Matt," It doesn't matter. When I go back, I'm not gonna remember any of this"
36659,Kol," Well, you better find a way to remember it. Look. You might not like me, but I'm not the only one over here, and if this place goes down, then what happened to your sister is going to happen to us all. Please, mate, you have to go back. You have to find out how to stop this"
36660,Bonnie, What?
36661,Jeremy, I just realized you're the only person in this office the sheriff hasn't k*ll
36662,Bonnie, You're making jokes now
36663,Jeremy," Bonnie, look. I'm sorry for everything. This whole thing with Liv, it had nothing to do with her. I was just trying to protect you"
36664,Bonnie," Ok. Here's what's not ok. Do what you want to protect me, but don't fall off the face of the earth, especially with someone who was caught lying to me and who tried to k*ll Elena. Don't put me in a position where I have to question you because I…"
36665,Jeremy, I know. Because of Anna. Look. I know I messed up
36666,Bonnie," Listen. I was gonna say because I choose to trust you, and I want to be right"
36667,Bonnie," Matt, are you ok, are you ok? "
36668,Jeremy, You died and came back from the other side
36669,Matt, I know. I remember
36670,Bonnie, You remember? That doesn't happen
36671,Matt," One second, I was holding Vick…"
36672,Jeremy, Wait. You saw Vicki?
36673,Matt," She pushed me away, and then… and then she just disappeared. What's going on over the, Bon?"
36674,Bonnie, I don't know
36675,Damon," I think we need some rules here because if I'm not allowed to drive you home, then I definitely don't think you're allowed to ambush me in my bedroom"
36676,Elena," I just… I just wanted to say thank you. Whatever you did, it worked"
36677,Damon," Well, I'm sorry to tear you away from paradise"
36678,Elena, It was paradise actually
36679,Damon, I told you I don't want to know
36680,Elena," But you need to know. I saw a perfect life. Stefan and I were married, and we had kids. It was everything that we wanted"
36681,Damon," Well, we can always ask Markos to put it back"
36682,Elena," But it's not real. You and I, we're messy and complicated, but we’re real"
36683,Damon, And really bad for each other. Did you forget that part?
36684,Elena," Yeah, but I still need you in my life"
36685,Damon," As friends, right? Right. No, Elena. I can't be your friend. It's too damn hard"
36686,Elena, Damon…
36687,Damon," No. I'm serious, Elena. I can't see you anymore. I don't want to hear your voice, I don't want to talk to you, I don't even want to look at you, and I sure as hell don't want to be your friend"
36688,Elena, If that's what you want
36689,Damon, That's what I want
36690,Caroline, Yeah. Ok. I gave her my bl*od.So what do I do? She's still unconscious
36691,Tyler," For starters, relax. Matt said he was out for a while when this happened to him"
36692,Caroline, What are they doing here? This is our home. We can't let them take over
36693,Tyler," They won't. I got it handled, I promise"
36694,Caroline," Thanks, Tyler"
36695,Tyler, You're welcome
36696,Caroline, I got to go. She's waking up
36697,Caroline, Hey
36698,Liz, What happened?
36699,Caroline, You missed lunch
36700,Tyler, We're in. She's oblivious
36701,Markos, It's not a bad upgrade either
36702,Tyler, This body is incredible
36703,Markos, Don't get used to it.Once this is over and the town is ours...
36704,Tyler, I know. It's gone
36705,Markos, Did you bring it?
36706,Tyler, This is the only kn*fe left
36707,Markos, It was the only kn*fe left
36708,Elena," Breakfast, Professor Salvatore?"
36709,Stefan," Oh, no, no, no, no. I see what you're doing"
36710,Elena, What am I doing?
36711,Stefan," Distraction tactics. Stay focused. So psychology, sociology, and anthropology share the assumption that..."
36712,Elena, Scientific methods can be used to understand human behavior
36713,Stefan," That's very good, as in verbatim, which means that I need to ask you more difficult questions"
36714,Elena, Thank you
36715,Stefan, For what?
36716,Elena, Volunteering to help me study the day after Damon declared that we can't be friends and that he never wants to see my face again.Speaking of distracting tactics
36717,Stefan, You're welcome
36718,Bonnie, Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.What did I miss?
36719,Elena, Just that Stefan's the tutor from hell
36720,Stefan, Unkind. Take that back
36721,Elena," Actually, I'm surprised that you're up for studying, you know, considering..."
36722,Bonnie, Considering?
36723,Elena, The other side... Falling apart. She's in denial
36724,Stefan, So I see
36725,Bonnie," I'm not in denial. The other side is disintegrating. As the anchor to the other side, I'm only alive as long as there is another side. I'm perfectly aware of the threat of my impending death. There is nothing I can do about it. It's called acceptance, fifth stage of grief. Look it up, tutor guy"
36726,Stefan, Definitely in denial
36727,Elena," Yeah. Look, Bonnie. I've already lost you once. We're not doing this again. It's not an option, ok? Not to mention what's gonna happen to Alaric and your grams and everyone else over there. So what are we gonna do?"
36728,Bonnie," Fine. If you guys promise to stop hovering, I'll ask Liv if she has any witchy ideas. Besides, don't we have bigger problems with those Travelers trying to take over Mystic Falls?"
36729,Stefan," Oh, no. Damon's already on that"
36730,Elena, He is?
36731,Stefan, Did I say Damon? What I meant to say was George 
36732,Elena, Damon said the he never wanted to see me again. I guess we're both in denial
36733,Jeremy, Ugh! Whose nasty-ass boxers are under the couch?
36734,Matt, Not mine. I actually do my laundry. It's not in the floor safe
36735,Jeremy, Or the kitchen cabinets or the garage or the bookshelves. The Traveler kn*fe is gone
36736,Matt, Are you sure Tyler hid it where he said he did?
36737,Jeremy," Well, obviously not"
36738,Damon, Dingdong! Invite me in
36739,Matt, We can hear you just fine from there
36740,Damon," Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted whatever weird ritual you two were doing, but I just want to de-passenger the great citizens of Mystic Falls using your magical Traveler kn*fe, so hand it over"
36741,Matt, That's gonna be a problem
36742,Damon," 5 words that make want to vamp-toss my keys into your chest cavity. Little Gilbert, help me in the fight against my dark side and elaborate, please"
36743,Jeremy, We can't find it
36744,Damon, As in you lost it?
36745,Matt, As in it's not here
36746,Damon, You're right. Don't invite me in because I will k*ll both of you
36747,Jeremy, Tyler said he hid it in the piano
36748,Damon, And when was the last time you heard from Tyler?
36749,Tyler, Where the hell am I?
36750,Markos," Not here. Veet. Welcome back, Julian. Apologies for the precautions, but you're passengered into the body of a hybrid. It's hard to know how long you have before his consciousness returns"
36751,Tyler/Julian, I see we moved yet again. At least this is a step up
36752,Markos," Just trying to keep our people comfortable. With luck, our days of striking camp are numbered. Sloan, 2,000 years ago, the witches put a curse on our tribe so nature would turn against us should we ever attempt to settle as a people. We have lived without a home, roaming like cattle. The prophecy states that we can break that curse, but in order to undo a witch's curse, one must have the power to undo a witch's magic.Our faithful Sloan has volunteered to be the… how do you say… guinea pig of our little experiment. Drink. Are you ready, Sloan?"
36753,Sloan, I'm ready
36754,Enzo, And to what do I owe the pleasure?
36755,Damon," You don't happen to know where I can finda Traveler, do you?"
36756,Enzo, You know Travelers… vagabonds and the like. Haven't seen any. Why?
36757,Damon, I've got two brain-dead teenagers who didn't realize two plus two equals one hijacked hybrid
36758,Enzo," Don't envy you there, mate"
36759,Damon," Well, what do you say… field trip? I mean, I'm sure there's some salvage yard we haven't toured yet. I think it's a little too dangerous to let Tweedledee and Tweedledumber out of the house.Last thing we need's another Traveler possession in our midst"
36760,Enzo, Sadly I've got to take a rain check. I'm late to meet some people
36761,Liv, What?
36762,Bonnie, Nothing. Not really nothing. More like a rhetorical question about how to fix an imploding supernatural purgatory
36763,Liv," Oh, great. He's here"
36764,Bonnie, You know Enzo?
36765,Liv, Yep. Not a fan
36766,Stefan, What are you doing here?
36767,Enzo, I can't join my friends for a cup of tea?
36768,Stefan," Damon, your friend, uh, singular, isn't here, and we're a little busy right now. But by all means, have a seat"
36769,Enzo," No need to be rude. I've come here for a chat. Elena, darling, perhaps Caroline told you I've been searching for someone I once knew, a woman named Maggie"
36770,Elena, Your elusive girlfriend from the Augustine days
36771,Enzo," Maggie worked there as an observer, taking notes on my behavior. She never got too close, never took off her Vervain bracelet, but we spent hours and hours talking, and we developed an attachment. Now she left in 1950. I imagined her one day teaching at one of these fancy universities, starting a family, living her life to the fullest. I'm sure you two can appreciate that"
36772,Elena, What's going on?
36773,Enzo," That Traveler girl Sloan gave me this yesterday, making good on a promise. Ahem. From the Augustine files left behind by our good Dr. Wes. Yes. Imagine how I felt when I saw it. Turns out Maggie died in 1960 in Mystic Falls. Someone tore her head right off her body"
36774,Elena," In 1960, were you…"
36775,Enzo, A ripper? Clearly
36776,Stefan," I wasn't a ripper then. I'm really sorry about your friend, but I had nothing to do with it"
36777,Enzo," Thought you might say that. Liv! A little service here, please"
36778,Bonnie," Liv, what are you doing? Stop"
36779,Liv, I can't stop. Sorry
36780,Enzo," That's my fault really. Where's Luke? See? I compelled a few blokes from the rugby team to keep her brother's life in jeopardy so that should the witch disobey he will die. There's a good soldier. Ok, Stefan. Are you ready to talk about what you did to the love of my life?"
36781,Luke, Tell him to use me instead
36782,Liv," I don't really think he's up for taking orders. Besides, I'm older than you"
36783,Luke, By 5 minutes
36784,Enzo, Get him out of here now
36785,Liv, Wait. What are you doing?
36786,Enzo, Get him out. Too many witches under one roof makes me nervous. I'll let you know if he needs to die. That Vervain water is going to hurt even worse if you struggle against those knots. Chap's in the sailing club
36787,Elena, How did you compel everyone here?
36788,Enzo," Place opens at 8:00, you got here at 9:00. Do the math, college girl. I will gladly release them once you admit you k*ll Maggie"
36789,Stefan, I would love to except I have absolutely no idea who she is
36790,Enzo," That's what this is for. Police found it on her body at the crime scene. ""June 10, 1951, I found a job at a preschool. I love the kids, but still I feel lost, listless.’’ ‘’March 1953, while my girlfriends have all found love, for some reason, I can't seem to connect with anyone as if a part of my soul is missing or dead. My sister said there are more men in the city. Maybe I'll move."" Now it turns out she did move to the city in 1958, and in the move, she uncovered a box that she hadn't touched in years… medical journals from 1950, covered in notes about a special vampire patient named 12144. Of course, when she came back, Whitmore House had b*rned, and it was concluded that I had perished in the fire.You're a journal man, aren't you, Stefan?"
36791,Stefan," This is ridiculous. In 1960, I was cleaned up. I was barely feeding on people, let alone k*ll them"
36792,Enzo, Good idea. Let's call Damon
36793,Damon, How is it Travelers are everywhere until you actually need to find one?
36794,Enzo, Hunt going poorly then?
36795,Damon, That's what I get for working with the Hardy boys
36796,Enzo," I take it you don't have Stefan's diaries handy. I need you to check his journal for an entry on November 8, 1960"
36797,Damon, Stefan b*rned his journals a while ago. He was in a mood. Why?
36798,Enzo," Well, just trying to settle a little debate. No matter. I'm right. How you hanging in there, man? I heard you exiled Elena from your eye line"
36799,Damon, How'd you hear that? Are you with them right now?
36800,Enzo, Not for long. I reckon one will be dead soon… eye for an eye and all that
36801,Damon," Whoa, whoa, whoa, Enzo. You have your m*rder voice on. I need you to speak very slowly and calmly and tell me what the hell the problem is"
36802,Enzo," The problem, if you must know, is that my girl Maggie, the one who got away, it turns out she didn't get away for long. Your ripper of a brother took a big bite out of her neck membrane in the sixties"
36803,Damon, Sixties? Stefan wasn't even…
36804,Enzo," Got to jet, mate. Nothing personal, just a bit of revenge, you understand?"
36805,Enzo," Any history majors in the house? Ah. Trick question. I compelled them all not to speak or react. Never mind. We'll use this. 1960. Let's see. Ford Thunderbirds, Lincoln Continentals, unseasonably cold that year. Tuesday, November 8, John F. Kennedy was running for president"
36806,Stefan, Election night
36807,Stefan, Ah. You're ok. Forget this ever happened and run
36808,Maggie, Gold star for impulse control. Don't worry. I'm not here to judge
36809,Stefan, Who the hell are you?
36810,Maggie, Maggie James and you're Stefan Salvatore. Sorry. It's just… it's all so fascinating. Here. I've been staring at Damon's picture for years. Guess you got the handsome genes
36811,Stefan, What do you know about my family?
36812,Maggie, I spent the last two years searching for your brother. I know everything about the two of you
36813,Stefan, Why are you so obsessed with my brother?
36814,Maggie, He knew a friend of mine who died in a fire. I was hoping you'd know where to find him
36815,Stefan, Ah. Why don't you do yourself a favor and stay away from my brother? He's a monster. He fell off the rails a couple of years ago. There's no talking sense into him
36816,Maggie," Well, it's a good thing I don't want to talk to him. I want to k*ll him"
36817,Stefan, Heh. So you want me to tell you where my brother is so that you can k*ll him?
36818,Maggie, You just said he's he a lost cause I'd be doing the world a favor
36819,Stefan," Well, it's too bad you're not doing yourself any favors"
36820,Elena, That was Maggie?
36821,Enzo, Now we're getting somewhere
36822,Stefan, I didn't k*ll her. I was just trying to scare her into leaving town
36823,Enzo, So it was the other ripper in Mystic Falls then?
36824,Stefan," I have no reason to lie to you, Enzo"
36825,Enzo, Are your lies worth Bonnie's life?
36826,Elena, Bonnie!
36827,Enzo, What exactly happens if you die anyway?
36828,Bonnie, Let go of me
36829,Enzo, Aren't you technically already dead? Should we find out?
36830,Stefan," Stop! You're right. I k*ll Maggie. I tore out her throat, and I ripped her head off. I completely forgot about her until now. That's the truth. Now let her go"
36831,Enzo, Take her upstairs
36832,Liv, You ok?
36833,Bonnie, You can cut the scared hostage act
36834,Liv, Excuse me?
36835,Bonnie," Enzo may be using you as his little pocket witch, but if he k*ll either of them, the Travelers can't do whatever they need to do with the doppelganger bl*od, and the witches win"
36836,Liv, Very clever. You should be a magic teacher
36837,Damon," Blondie, now is not the time to be screening my calls. You're the only one unaccounted for, and I don't know where Elena and Stefan are. At least call your mother"
36838,Liz, Why the sudden interest in Mystic Falls’ history?
36839,Damon, You know when your brother k*ll your only friend's girl and you're stuck in the middle?
36840,Liz, No
36841,Damon," Well, then don't ask"
36842,Liz, Ok. 1960. There was a mugging reported November 9
36843,Damon," No, no, no. It has to be the eighth. He was very specific about the eighth"
36844,Liz," Ok. Well, that would be Maggie James. Died November 8, 1960, unresolved homicide, possible serial k*ll"
36845,Damon, Stefan was right. He didn't k*ll Enzo's girl
36846,Liz, How do you know?
36847,Damon, Because I did
36848,Maggie, It's the only way to get you out of here. Make me a vampire. I'll save you.We'll run away together.Don't you want to be with me?
36849,Enzo, More than anything in this world
36850,Maggie, Then I'm ready. Dr. Whitmore's back. You need to hurry
36851,Enzo," Come closer.Take my hand. Leave, Maggie. Leave and never come back, and when you go, forget I ever existed, forget that I love you. Wait. Must have fallen from your wrist"
36852,Maggie, Sorry
36853,Enzo, Where were we then?
36854,Elena, Stop. You made your point
36855,Enzo, What was that? I couldn't hear you over all the…
36856,Liv," Oh, I'm sorry. Is there a more appropriate reaction to torture?"
36857,Bonnie," This whole time, I thought I was doing you some favor by teaching you magic, and you're more powerful than I ever was"
36858,Liv," It's nothing personal. It was our job to protect the doppelgangers. You were an easy in,but, yeah, the stuff you were teaching me I learned in first grade"
36859,Bonnie, Does your coven know the other side is falling apart?
36860,Liv, Why? You scared you're not gonna make it through to finals?
36861,Bonnie," It is not about me. I have friends there, my grams. I mean, there's got to be something that can be done to save it, a spell, a ritual, something"
36862,Enzo," I used to scream, too, but for me, it wasn't so much the sharp instruments as it was the fingers. Those bloody fingers. Like I was a ball of dough"
36863,Damon," Well, this is depressing. Stadium seating really necessary? These people are starting to creep me out"
36864,Enzo," If I didn't know any better, I'd say that was a veiled attempt to get to release the damn hostages"
36865,Damon," Oh, I'm sorry. Was that veiled? Release the damn hostages"
36866,Enzo, Whose side are you on?
36867,Damon, There are sides now?
36868,Enzo, You were there with me in Augustine. Look. Don't tell me you've forgotten what it was like to cling onto the one thing that kept you from feeling pain!
36869,Damon," Enzo, I get it. The prospect of seeing Maggie again was your safety line to the outside world, the one thing that kept you from shutting it off, but she's gone. There's probably a chapter in Elena's psych book about it. What, are you two study buddies now?"
36870,Damon, The thing is I didn't know she was your Maggie
36871,Enzo, What are you talking about?
36872,Damon, She didn't tell me her name when we met
36873,Enzo, And when exactly was that?
36874,Damon," November 8, 1960"
36875,Maggie, Hi
36876,Damon," I'd gotten a message at the house saying a lady wanted to buy me a drink. Naturally, I was curious"
36877,Maggie, I'd like to interview you for an article I'm writing
36878,Damon," Oh, yeah? What are thinking… ""Life"" magazine?"
36879,Maggie," Not quite. I'm with the ""Whitmore College Alumni Gazette."" Where is my cigarette lighter?"
36880,Damon, Whitmore. I spent a lot of time there
36881,Maggie, Oh. Then you remember the fire of '58 at Whitmore house?
36882,Damon," Vividly. It was incredibly hot,very loud, lots of screaming. So I heard"
36883,Maggie," I'm afraid that's a little glib to quote for the ""Gazette,"" seeing as over a dozen people died"
36884,Damon," Sensitive readership. Got you. See, I have this switch in my brain. Feel something I don't want to feel... Click, it's gone easy as pie"
36885,Maggie, You really are a monster
36886,Damon, I'm not a fan of needles. Oh. An Augustine. How refreshing of you to find me. I usually have to hunt you people down
36887,Damon," Had she gotten me with that Vervain injection, things would have been very different. She didn't stand a chance against me"
36888,Stefan, And you made it look like I did it?
36889,Damon," Maggie was the hope Enzo clung to. You were mine, and when you didn't notice that I was missing for 5 years, let's just say I held a grudge"
36890,Enzo, You k*ll Maggie
36891,Damon," I didn't even bat an eye. My switch was off, Enzo. I did a lot of terrible things, but I didn't do it to make your life miserable from every angle. I did it because I didn't care. Just do whatever it is you got to do. You want to k*ll me, you want to hate me, do it. This is between us"
36892,Enzo," Well, that's the problem, Damon. I don't want to hate you. Because if I hate you, then I have nothing left. There is another option"
36893,Damon," Don't you dare! Hey, Enzo!"
36894,Enzo, There we are. You're right! I don't have a care in the world
36895,Markos, How are you feeling?
36896,Sloan, The lights…
36897,Markos," All part of your transition. Vampirism originated from the magic of witches, and it is in the prophecy that the bl*od of the final two doppelgangers will undo witch magic.The last of our doppelganger bl*od"
36898,Enzo," This is fun, not caring"
36899,Damon, Yep. Emotion-free. Bye-bye humanity
36900,Enzo, To Maggie James for whom I feel absolute and blissful detachment
36901,Damon, What do you say we get out of here? Where was it that you wanted to go… Cape Town?
36902,Enzo, Cape Horn
36903,Damon, Even better
36904,Enzo," All right. Everyone's free to go! Show's over! Don't worry. I compelled you all to think you spent the day studying like the good, little students you are. Except you. Stay. I want to test something. Look at that. I don't even feel obliged to say thank you"
36905,Damon, No. Bastard. He took Elena
36906,Stefan, Let's go
36907,Bonnie," No. Please, Stefan"
36908,Damon, You deal with her. I'll find Enzo
36909,Stefan," He's gonna k*ll her. You know that, right?"
36910,Damon, I can handle him
36911,Stefan, Damon!
36912,Damon, I said I could handle him
36913,Stefan, He wants to hurt you in any way he can. You can't save him
36914,Damon, The witch is dying
36915,Stefan, Drink
36916,Bonnie," Come on, Liv. You're ok, you're ok"
36917,Stefan, You got this?
36918,Bonnie," Yeah, go"
36919,Damon," Enzo, I need you to come find me, ok, and I will give you a first-class ticket to Cape wherever it is. Hell, I'll even come with you. I mean, let's face it. No one's gonna miss me here, but don't hurt Elena, ok? You leave her alone, I swear I'll never ask you for anything again"
36920,Elena," If you were gonna k*ll me, I'd be dead"
36921,Enzo, I think you mean when I k*ll you you'll be dead
36922,Elena, I know how you're feeling
36923,Enzo, That's the point. I feel nothing
36924,Elena," You're just lost. You think cutting all this out of your life is the answer, but you're just biding time until it all comes crashing back"
36925,Enzo, I know why Damon doesn't want to deal with you anymore
36926,Stefan, Hey!
36927,Enzo, Stefan. Where's big brother?
36928,Stefan, I don't know. Guess I found you first
36929,Enzo, Ouch. Hope it's insured
36930,Liv," Can you call my brother, see if he's ok?"
36931,Bonnie, It's already done. He's fine. So you're probably gonna get fired
36932,Liv, Probably. You asked if there was anything you could do about the other side
36933,Bonnie, Did you think of something?
36934,Liv," Say good-bye to your friends, Bonnie. The other side's just like any other spell. You know how that works. Just like any other recipe or math equation, remove one component, and the whole thing implodes on itself. When those Travelers let Markos escape... Boom"
36935,Bonnie," But there's always another spell, a loophole, a sacrifice, something"
36936,Liv," Jeremy loves you, Bonnie. He deserves to know you're leaving"
36937,Damon, Elena! Elena. You’re okay
36938,Enzo," Bet you wished you'd m*rder me back when you had the chance, but Damon would have been furious. I think it's time we both stopped coddling him. Now where is my lighter? Maggie's lighter, I should say. I wonder what she'd think of all this. Of course, who knows what lies in the great beyond for a mere human like Maggie James? Probably nothing It's probably just as well she's not watching this. I believe it might upset her. We'll burn together, you and I. Perhaps just you"
36939,Stefan," My brother, he sees something good in you"
36940,Enzo, And you? Isn't there a part of you that thinks I can be redeemed?
36941,Stefan, Not with your emotions off. You won't stop until you k*ll Damon
36942,Enzo," Better yet, wouldn't it be a sweet piece of revenge when Damon finds out you k*ll his best friend? Have fun sorting this out with your brother"
36943,Stefan, Hi. You ok?
36944,Elena," Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just still a bit confused about how I got here"
36945,Stefan, Bonnie here?
36946,Elena, No. She never came back
36947,Stefan, Enzo's dead
36948,Elena, Did you...
36949,Stefan, Yeah
36950,Elena, Does Damon know?
36951,Stefan, I basically just k*ll my brother's only friend. It's been a tough year for Damon. Don't you think it would be easier if no-humanity Enzo just left for parts unknown and was never heard from again?
36952,Elena," Ohh. Stefan, I don't know if I can…"
36953,Stefan," Listen, Elena. Damon thinks that Enzo left town, and we need to keep it that way. We barely just got him back. This would destroy him. Please"
36954,Jeremy, We think Tyler's with the Travelers
36955,Matt, And we're stuck here because Damon said he'd twist off our kneecaps if we left
36956,Bonnie, Do you mind if I talk to Jeremy for a sec?
36957,Matt," No. I'm glad you're ok, Bon"
36958,Bonnie, Thanks
36959,Jeremy, Ok. You've got your superserious face on
36960,Bonnie," Do I? In light of the Tyler thing, it's probably nothing, but…"
36961,Jeremy," Bon, come on. What is it?"
36962,Bonnie," This whole thing with the other side, I don't know what's going on, but if it does go away... Liv thinks there might be a way to save me, so..."
36963,Bonnie, Whew. Sorry. Hang on. It's Stefan
36964,Bonnie, Hello?
36965,Stefan, Who are you with right now?
36966,Bonnie, Jeremy. Why?
36967,Stefan," Because Enzo's dead, and I don't mean to put this on you, but Damon can't find out. Bonnie?"
36968,Bonnie, Yep. Understand
36969,Enzo," Damage control, is it?"
36970,Jeremy," Bonnie, what's going on?"
36971,Bonnie," Nothing. Just someone passing through to the other side, a werewolf or something"
36972,Enzo, Go on. Keep your little secret. You'll see me again. Did I mention how good I am at revenge?
36973,Markos," The moment of truth. Are you still a vampire,or is the prophecy true? Did the doppelganger bl*od revert you back to your human form?"
36974,Sloan, I'm not healing.I'm not a vampire anymore
36975,Markos," Congratulations.If we can undo the magic in Mystic Falls, we can undo the witches' curse that prevents us from finding a home. We'll finally have a place to settle. Sadly I'm afraid you won't be able to enjoy it with us. The doppelganger bl*od removes magic. Unfortunately without the magic of vampirism to keep her alive,Sloan has reverted to her final human state…"
36976,Tyler, Dead
36977,Markos," Exactly, Julian.She's dead. Such is the fate of any vampire that tries to live in our new home. We're almost ready to begin our work except... We're gonna need a lot more bl*od"
36978,Damon," I know. I know what you're thinking. I screwed up. I'm the reason Enzo's in our lives, I'm the reason he wants us dead. It's all my fault, and I'll fix it, ok? He was there for me when I was at my worst. I'll find a way to be there for him. I'll get him back. I'll fix it. Did I leave anything out?"
36979,Stefan," I, uh, checked in on Elena. She's, uh… she's all right"
36980,Damon," Yeah, I know. I found her on campus. She was unconscious, I took her home, tucked her in"
36981,Stefan, You didn't leave a note?
36982,Damon," I think I'm past trying to earn points for good behavior, Stefan"
36983,Stefan," You know, what happened today wasn't your fault"
36984,Damon," That's very noble of you, brother. We both know it's not the truth"
36985,Stefan," Well, either way, I think it's time you leave Enzo alone"
36986,Damon, I can’t
36987,Stefan," Come on, Damon. He's not your responsibility"
36988,Damon," What, you're the only one that gets to play hero? Or you just don't think I can do it?"
36989,Stefan, I think that he's not worth saving
36990,Damon," You don't know what you're talking about, Stefan"
36991,Stefan, Really?
36992,Damon," Yeah, because you know what you never knew? The whole time I was in that cell, every time I'd say something terrible about you or blame you for not coming to rescue me, Enzo would bring me back from the edge"
36993,Stefan, I know you guys were close
36994,Damon," Enzo reminded me that at least I got to grow up with a family, at least I had family still out there, which was more than he could say for himself. Said he envied me for having a brother"
36995,Stefan, Even a crappy one like me?
36996,Damon," Even a crappy one like you. He defended you, Stefan, even though he didn't know you. Said it was good that we had people on the outside, people just living their lives free and clear of our Augustine hell, people worth holding on to our humanity for because we loved them. And all that time as a prisoner, every time I wanted to give up on you, Enzo stopped me from hating you. That's why I have to help him. And I owe him for that. And so do you"
36997,Enzo," It's too late to make amends, Damon. You know me. Never let go of a good vendetta, and this one is just getting started."
36998,Maria," Wake up, babe"
36999,Maria, I've missed you. Julian? Is that still you?
37000,Tyler," Yeah. Bad dream. What were you saying? Oh. Look. I'm always up for a little bit of kink, but..."
37001,Maria, Markos' orders. Put them on you as soon as you fell asleep. You're passengered in a hybrid. We can't risk him popping out. The pecs are a plus. But extra security's a minus
37002,Man," Maria, we're on the move"
37003,Maria, Looks like this is gonna have to wait
37004,Tyler, Where are we going?
37005,Maria," To the next camp, which will hopefully be our last camp. Markos is ready to do the spell. He's taking the doppelgangers"
37006,Tyler, Today?
37007,Maria," As soon as we're out of here.Soon, we can actually have a home, and I can finally have a closet.. Better yet, two closets, one for clothes and one for shoes. Julian? Julian? Babe, what's wrong? Open your eyes. Oh, my God. You're not... I need help! Somebody!"
37008,Luke, That's not helping
37009,Damon," Well, you've been failing now for an hour, wonder twin, so at this point, I can't imagine it's hurting"
37010,Stefan," Damon, I know you're out of friend, but, uh, I'm not sure this guy's the best replacement"
37011,Damon, I don't think this guy's be the best anything if his locator spell k*ll are any indication. Where's your sister?
37012,Luke," She's tired of being almost m*rder. Look. I can find any person anywhere on the planet, ok? There's just something weird with your friend Enzo. I can't get a read"
37013,Stefan," Enzo? Didn't he, uh, go to Cape Horn?"
37014,Damon, He flipped his humanity switch.There should have been a body count all the way to the airport
37015,Stefan," Well, why are you looking for him?"
37016,Damon," Gee. I don't know, Stefan. Vampire with no humanity who wants me dead for k*ll his girl"
37017,Stefan," Well, maybe he hired a witch to block whatever Luke's doing. Is that possible?"
37018,Luke, A cloaking spell? I guess
37019,Stefan," That would mean that he doesn't want to be found, so, uh, why don't you just drop it?"
37020,Tyler, We have a problem
37021,Tyler," Markos turned Sloan into a vampire, had her drink doppelganger bl*od, and after some chanting ritual thing, she turned human gain"
37022,Damon, He cured her?
37023,Tyler, He cured her to death. The bl*od took away her vampirismbut left her in the state that she was in just before she turned
37024,Stefan, That state being dead. Got it
37025,Luke, So it k*ll vampires. What does the spell mean for the witches?
37026,Damon, No one cares. Wait. Keep going
37027,Tyler, The point is they feel if they can get rid of all magic they'll break some lame-ass witch curse
37028,Damon," Markos said they can't settle anywhere without evoking earthquakes or hellfire, but they break that curse and they just move right on into Mystic Falls"
37029,Stefan," And come after Elena and me today, as in now"
37030,Damon," Oh, well. Markos had a good week or two in the land of the living. Now where is he so I can k*ll him?"
37031,Tyler, No idea. They were moving camp when I got out
37032,Damon," Well, good news. Our friend Luke here is an alleged genius at locator spells"
37033,Luke, Travelers are always moving. They're impossible to track. They'll find Stefan and Elena long before we can find them
37034,Damon," Well, what about one of those locator spells blocker deals? Is that simple enough for you?"
37035,Luke," If both doppelgangers are in the same place, yeah"
37036,Damon," Perfect. You avoid the entire Czech language, figure out how to find Markos"
37037,Tyler, How am I supposed to do that?
37038,Damon," Well, you have a traveler inside of you. I mean, I have probably misplaced faith that you'll figure it out. Meanwhile, you and I and our ex-girlfriend are gonna go on a little secret trip"
37039,Stefan, Sounds great
37040,Elena, This is a terrible idea
37041,Stefan," Well, what did you want me to say?""No, Damon. It will be awkward to have the 3 of us confined to Caroline's dad's cabin because I k*ll your best friend and Elena's keeping that secret for me""?"
37042,Elena, We should have told him
37043,Stefan, Look. I don't trust that he'd be able to hold it together
37044,Elena, Because Enzo's dead or because you k*ll him?
37045,Stefan," Either, both. I don't know. Either way..."
37046,Caroline," Good news! So we don't have to be invited in,which is actually supersad if you think about it. Am I interrupting something?"
37047,Elena," No, no. We're just, um..."
37048,Stefan," Unpacking. We're unpacking. Uh, here you go"
37049,Caroline, Ok…
37050,Elena, So where's Damon now?
37051,Stefan, Helping Luke set up
37052,Elena, Helping Luke or avoiding me?
37053,Stefan, You really don't think he wants to be around you?
37054,Elena," Well, technically, he said, ""I don't want to hear your voice, and I don't want to see your face,""because it's too hard for him"
37055,Stefan, Who do you think brought you home last night?
37056,Elena, Really?
37057,Stefan," Oh, yeah. Tucked you in safely"
37058,Elena," Well, that was an extreme circumstance. Enzo almost k*ll me"
37059,Stefan," Probably read you a nice, little bedtime story"
37060,Elena, Stop it. You're the least helpful person I know
37061,Caroline," For a couple of doppeltargets,you two seem to be taking this all in stride"
37062,Stefan," Yeah. Well, you know, a tribe of ancient wannabe witches want to drain of us our bl*od and eliminate supernatural beings? I've had worse"
37063,Enzo," For some reason, I thought that would feel better"
37064,Damon, Cozy
37065,Elena, Yeah. Caroline used to invite me here before her parents split. Her dad could tell a pretty good ghost story
37066,Damon," Well, I hope that dickwad's spirit isn't floating around anywhere"
37067,Elena, Have a little respect for the dead
37068,Damon, I respect that he's dead. How about that? I'm supposed to be avoiding you
37069,Elena, Is that still what you want?
37070,Damon, Yes .No. I don't know
37071,Elena," Well, Luke did the cloaking spell. Stefan and Caroline are here, so we should be good... But if it's too hard for you to be here, then..."
37072,Damon, You kicking me out?
37073,Elena, Yes. No. I don't know
37074,Damon, I'm really sorry Enzo came after you. That was my fault. He was hurt
37075,Elena, It's not a big deal
37076,Damon," It is a big deal.He almost k*ll you, Elena, so I'm gonna hunt his ass down, I'm gonna whip some sense to him, and I'm gonna make him apologize in person, ok? What?"
37077,Elena," Hmm? No. Nothing. I just, uh... I just remembered that Stefan asked me to help him bring some firewood in, so I'll be right back"
37078,Bonnie, What?
37079,Jeremy, What are we gonna do about the other side slipping off into oblivion and you with it?
37080,Bonnie," We have the dorm to ourselves for an entire weekend, and you want to talk logistics?"
37081,Jeremy, I'm just saying that I would enjoy this weekend a whole lot more if I knew we were gonna be able to keep doing it
37082,Bonnie, I told you Liv is working on a spell to keep me here
37083,Bonnie, Oh. Another secret bro meeting?
37084,Jeremy," No more secrets, remember? Tyler's back. We should get over there. Let me grab my stuff"
37085,Sheila, Please tell me more about this special spell that your friend Liv has concocted
37086,Bonnie, I know I shouldn't lie
37087,Sheila," He deserves the truth, Bonnie. It's not getting any better over here. People are getting swept away, and when this place goes, you are going with it"
37088,Bonnie, I know I have to tell him. I just need a few more days with him before I... How did you do that? How did you move that? You can't move things from the other side. That doesn't happen
37089,Sheila, That's what I'm trying to tell you. This place is falling apart. Tell him soon. False hope doesn't protect him. It protects you
37090,Elena, I lied to his face
37091,Stefan," Yeah, I know, but you know what? Think of all the times he's lied to you and call it a freebie"
37092,Enzo, Glad you two find my death so amusing
37093,Stefan, I'm sorry that you have to go through this
37094,Enzo, You're sorry for that? I'm glad we've got our priorities straight
37095,Elena," Look. I know that we're doing this for Damon, but it still just sucks"
37096,Stefan," Elena, this is exactly what Enzo wanted. He wanted the bl*od to be on my hands, and I refuse to give him the satisfaction of feeling guilty about any of it"
37097,Elena, And you think Damon is just gonna forget and move on?
37098,Stefan, He's done it before. Come on. Let's get out of here
37099,Enzo, Now there's an interesting development
37100,Damon," Hey, munchie. Those are not for you"
37101,Caroline, I'm thinking. Hey!
37102,Damon," ""Area 51."""
37103,Caroline, Stop!
37104,Damon," ""J.F.K. assassination""? What the hell is that?"
37105,Caroline, You're ruining the game
37106,Damon, What game?
37107,Caroline, Charades. Our theme is secrets that people think they're getting away with
37108,Damon," Well, Meryl Streep, I'd love to know how we're gonna act out Watergate"
37109,Caroline," Well, I'm sure team Stelena will figure it out"
37110,Damon," ""A,"" you just implied that I was on your team. Two, you just gave me that judgy little hinty voice. So what am I missing?"
37111,Caroline, It's probably nothing
37112,Damon, Speak
37113,Caroline," Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena have been a little... You know?"
37114,Damon, No. Clearly I don't
37115,Caroline," Secretive? I caught them being all hushed and whispery at the car this morning, and now they're getting firewood out of the shed together, which apparently takes 20 minutes"
37116,Damon," You know, now that you mention it, Elena got all cagey when I brought up Enzo"
37117,Caroline," No, no. I'm not talking about Enzo. I'm talking about Stefan and Elena"
37118,Damon, How much have you had to drink?
37119,Caroline," Come on! She's single now, you two are on the outs"
37120,Elena, Cocktails. Good call
37121,Stefan," I'll, uh... I'll make a fire"
37122,Elena, I'll help. Ahem
37123,Damon, Let the games begin
37124,Bonnie," When we planned our romantic day together, I wasn't picturing you, me, and two other guys"
37125,Jeremy," Trust me, neither was I"
37126,Jeremy," One part wolfsbane, one part vervain. All together, the dumbest idea that either of you have ever had"
37127,Matt, Don't look at me. This is all Ty.
37128,Tyler, These should hold. Let's do this
37129,Bonnie," Not to be the only girl here, but I can't watch this. I'm gonna go upstairs"
37130,Matt," Ty, once this guy pops out, we have no idea when you'll come back again"
37131,Tyler," Some freak is inside my body.He took over my life.God only knows what he's got planned for me, so unless you've got any better ideas, this is what we're doing"
37132,Matt, Ok. Let's do this
37133,Tyler/Julian, Who are you? Where am I?
37134,Matt, Where's Markos?
37135,Tyler/Julian, Go to hell
37136,Matt," To answer your question, my name is Matt, and you, Julian, are inside my best friend, aka your own personal hell"
37137,Markos, Maria. Julian's your husband. Why didn't you realize he wasn't in control of the body?
37138,Maria, He'd only been called out for a few hours. I've never seen a host reemerge so quickly
37139,Markos," You've never seen a hybrid before either. Find him!And make him permanent. As for the rest of you, I see a lot of walking when I should be hearing chanting. Find me the doppelgangers"
37140,Stefan," Uh, ok. Think. Ponder. Brain. I don't know. Uh, skull!"
37141,Elena, Yes!
37142,Stefan," All right! Skull, skull.Ok. Limb. Joint. Bone, bone. Skull and bones. Skull and bones! Got it! 5-0, 5-0. Come on guys, this is it"
37143,Damon," Ok. Let's play a game called never have I ever, hmm?"
37144,Elena," Oh, I don't think I'm drunk enough"
37145,Caroline," Oh, come on! It'll be fun! Come on. It'll be fun. I'll go first.Never have I ever died"
37146,Damon, Cheers to that one. Cheers
37147,Stefan," Ooh! Ok. Um, never have I ever been possessed by my evil doppelganger"
37148,Elena, Mean. Never have I ever been fooled by evil doppelganger while she was pretending to be me
37149,Caroline, Low blow
37150,Damon, Tough but fair
37151,Elena, Never have I ever kissed a Salvatore brother. Today. So are you gonna drink or...
37152,Elena, Are you implying something?
37153,Stefan," Well, I'm gonna get another round. Does anybody..."
37154,Damon, Never have I ever lied about where Enzo is
37155,Caroline, Ok. What is going on?
37156,Stefan, Nothing obviously because nobody's drinking
37157,Damon," I mean, clearly you know the rules of the game, right, brother? If you lied, you drink"
37158,Stefan," Oh, no. I understand the rules"
37159,Elena," This just got weird. I'm officially buzzed, so I'm gonna go and get ready for bed"
37160,Damon," Well, I could certainly use another round"
37161,Enzo," Avoiding, are we?Nothing a hot bath won't fix. Wash the guilt straight down the drain"
37162,Elena, Damon!
37163,Damon, Elena! Come here. Come on. What happened?
37164,Elena, There was someone in here
37165,Damon, Who?
37166,Elena," I don't know. I didn't... I didn't see anyone, but I could feel someone pushing me under the water"
37167,Damon," Ok. I'd blame it on the spirit of Bill Forbes, but I don't think you're his type. Besides, why would a ghost be targeting you? Hey. Elena"
37168,Elena, Damon
37169,Damon, What? Hey
37170,Matt, There's plenty more where that came from. Where's Markos?
37171,Tyler/Julian, What does it matter to you?
37172,Jeremy, He wants to k*ll my sister. I want to stop him
37173,Tyler/Julian," You're a fool. Markos destroyed your only w*apon against passengers like me, and there's no way in hell you'd ever k*ll your best friend"
37174,Matt," You're right. I don't plan on k*ll you, but I do plan on getting my answers. Where's Markos?"
37175,Tyler/Julian," Stop! I can't tell you where Markos is because I don't know, but I can tell you where my body is"
37176,Jeremy, Why do we care?
37177,Tyler/Julian," Because Markos doesn't like problems, and your boy escaping camp means he's Markos' problem"
37178,Matt, So?
37179,Tyler/Julian," So knowing Markos,he's gonna want to get rid of Tyler for good by making this my body permanently"
37180,Bonnie," Stefan, hey. Remind me why I passed on the cloaking spell party again"
37181,Stefan," Well, it's not exactly a relaxing getaway. Listen. Are things getting worse on the other side?"
37182,Bonnie, Why?
37183,Stefan, Because something attacked Elena. Is it possible that someone over there could physically affect this plane?
37184,Bonnie," Actually, yeah. My grams knocked a lamp right off my desk today. I doubt it's easy, but if someone were emotional enough..."
37185,Stefan, Enzo
37186,Caroline, Enzo's dead?
37187,Stefan," Yeah. I, uh, I k*ll him"
37188,Caroline, So my powers of deduction really suck. Why didn't you say anything?
37189,Stefan, Because it's complicated
37190,Damon, Enter the complication. Enzo's dead. You k*ll him. Elena told me
37191,Caroline, So you didn't know either?
37192,Damon, Nope
37193,Caroline, And their secret really was about Enzo
37194,Damon, Yep
37195,Stefan," You guys think we could, um, talk about this some other time?"
37196,Damon," By all means, brother. At your convenience"
37197,Stefan," Listen. The other side is falling apart, and I think it's allowing Enzo to mess with us"
37198,Damon, Enzo! You in here?
37199,Enzo, Don't reckon I'd miss this
37200,Damon, Because knock it off!
37201,Caroline," It doesn't make any sense. If Enzo wanted to k*ll Elena,drowning her wouldn't have worked"
37202,Enzo, Smart girl. See why you like her so much
37203,Stefan, Maybe he’s just trying to scare us
37204,Enzo, Warmer. Come on! You've almost got it What is Enzo up to?
37205,Damon, Drowning Elena was just a distraction. He figured out a way to k*ll us all in one fell swoop
37206,Enzo, Did I mention that I missed you?
37207,Damon, Crap
37208,Stefan, Where's Luke?
37209,Damon, Who knows? We better find him before the travelers find us
37210,Markos, Stop! I found them
37211,Caroline, Luke? Luke? Where are you?
37212,Elena, Maybe Luke… You're upset
37213,Caroline," I'm not upset. Just looking for Luke,you know, Luke, who was here to protect you and Stefan, Luke, who's now missing because you and Stefan lied about where Enzo was, and now the travelers can find you,do their spell, and wipe us all off the face of the earth"
37214,Elena, I was worried that if Damon found out...
37215,Caroline," What, he'd flip out and spiral and k*ll a bunch of innocent people? Yeah, I get that. I, however, am not Damon,so the fact that you lied to me about it makes less sense"
37216,Elena, I just didn't want to put you in an awkward position
37217,Caroline, Because it wasn't awkward when I accused you and Stefan of being makeout buddies again?
37218,Elena," Actually, yes, it was. Where did that even come from?"
37219,Caroline, I have no idea
37220,Elena," Well, are you over it?"
37221,Caroline, Yes
37222,Elena, Good. Now let's go find Luke
37223,Stefan, You need to know why I lied to you
37224,Damon," Nope, I don't"
37225,Stefan," Damon, come on"
37226,Damon," Let's just cut to the chase, Stefan, because I'm not in a hash out our differences kind of mood. Yes, I'm pissed that you k*ll Enzo. I'm even more pissed that you two lied to me about it. You know what, Stefan?If it was me and I was in your shoes, I would have done it, too, except I would have done it months ago. The fact that you took this long..."
37227,Stefan, He was your friend
37228,Damon," Yes, Stefan, he was my friend, which is why I, above anyone else, should have known that he was dead. Let's just find the stupid witch"
37229,Bonnie, Of course the creepy travelers are hiding their bodies in creepy caves
37230,Jeremy, Try to think of them as romantic travelers and romantic caves since we're technically still on our date weekend
37231,Bonnie," Right. Oh, my God. These travelers are passengered inside people in Mystic Falls?"
37232,Jeremy, I take it back. This is creepy
37233,Damon, What'd you think I was gonna do?
37234,Stefan, What are you talking about?
37235,Damon," When I found out Enzo was dead? Did you think I was gonna go on a rampage, slaughter a bunch of innocent people, go bowling with human heads? What'd you think I was gonna do?"
37236,Stefan," Hate me. I thought you would, uh, hate me"
37237,Damon, You hear that?
37238,Stefan, Yeah. Come on
37239,Stefan, He's barely breathing
37240,Damon, Why the hell would Enzo dump him here?
37241,Damon," Smell that? Grab him. Let's go. Dick move, Enzo. If only this wasn't totally avoidable"
37242,Stefan," Oh, really? Now you're doing ""I told you so""?"
37243,Damon," This isn't gonna stop, Stefan. I k*ll his girl, you k*ll him. This is not gonna stop"
37244,Enzo, He's right. I like poetic justice. Damon Salvatore and his m*rder brother die a fiery death
37245,Damon," You listening to me? Is that a yes or a no? Because I can bring you back. Bonnie came back, Markos came back. I'll find a way, but this has to stop. How do you think you're able to do all this stuff, huh? The other side's falling apart, Enzo, so you can either help me, or you can blink out of existence. It's your choice.Go on, Stefan. Get Luke out of here. He's the only one that can hide you and Elena. Go now!"
37246,Enzo, Don't let me down again
37247,Bonnie, You're sure Julian has an eagle tattoo?
37248,Jeremy, That's what he said. I'm pretty sure that's a dove
37249,Bonnie, Or a really cute eagle. Moving on
37250,Jeremy, Look. I'm sorry. This is the worst date ever
37251,Bonnie," We're together in a cave of semiconscious travelers, who want to take over our town, but it could be worse, right?"
37252,Maria, Right. It could be
37253,Bonnie, Jeremy?! Jeremy!
37254,Maria," He may be a hunter, but you'd be surprised at how easy it is to restrict a man's airways"
37255,Bonnie, Please stop!Stop! Jeremy. Jeremy! Stop!
37256,Stefan, Feeling ok?
37257,Luke, Liv and I should have k*ll you when we had the chance
37258,Stefan," Yeah. Well, you didn't, and, uh, I don't understand why, but thank you"
37259,Luke," Let's just say my family's pretty screwed up, not a whole lot of compassion. You guys are different.You protect each other"
37260,Stefan," Well, we still need you to protect us, so why don't you get your stuff and we can get the hell out of here?"
37261,Luke, Yeah
37262,Stefan, I guess Enzo bought it
37263,Damon, Bought what?
37264,Stefan," Bring him back. I mean, how do you plan on doing that?"
37265,Damon, Markos found his way back. It's not impossible unless you want him terrorizing us for the rest of eternity
37266,Stefan," Not particularly. Uh, look. I know that..."
37267,Damon, Had to do that for Enzo. That's the last time you'll hear about it from me
37268,Elena, Damon…
37269,Tyler, What do you mean you lost Julian's body?
37270,Bonnie, You/he was right. The travelers wanted it
37271,Jeremy, But we'll find it.We just need to figure out where they went
37272,Tyler," Hold on. What do they need his body for? Guys, talk to me. Why did they take it?"
37273,Matt," Ty, what's wrong?"
37274,Tyler, I'm seeing things
37275,Jeremy," Tyler, talk to us"
37276,Tyler, I don't know what the hell's happening. It's like I'm seeing his life
37277,Bonnie," Oh, my God. They started the spell to make Julian permanent"
37278,Tyler, Make it stop. Make it stop!
37279,Jeremy, Tyler…
37280,Tyler/Julian, I take it you didn't find my body
37281,Stefan, Never have I ever had a ghost try to burn me alive
37282,Caroline, Drink
37283,Stefan, Come on. Car's packed. We got to get out of here
37284,Caroline," We're friends, right? We tell each other things, we trust each other"
37285,Stefan," Caroline, it's not because I didn't trust you"
37286,Caroline," No. It's just that you trust Elena more, and I get it. Of course you would. Still sucks to be left out of the loop, you know?"
37287,Stefan," Well, if it makes you feel any better, there are things that I tell you that I don't tell her"
37288,Caroline, Like what?
37289,Stefan, Like you have dirt on your cheek. And look. Maybe I didn't want you to know that I k*ll Enzo
37290,Caroline, Why?
37291,Stefan," Because I know you, and I know you guys had that weird little chemistry thing going on"
37292,Caroline," Oh, please!You're delusional"
37293,Stefan," I didn't want you to think any less of me. I'll, uh... I'll meet you over by the car when you're done"
37294,Elena, Hey
37295,Damon, Hey. We're leaving. Pack your stuff
37296,Elena, I will. I just came out to see how you're doing
37297,Damon," I'm in a hurry. You should be, too. The travelers can find us"
37298,Elena, So that's it? We're not gonna talk about this?
37299,Damon, What's there to talk about?
37300,Elena, I'm sorry that I lied to you
37301,Damon, I don't care that you lied really
37302,Elena, Ok. I'm confused. Why are you being like this?
37303,Damon," Because you were right, Elena. You wanted to protect me so I wouldn't spiral because if I spiraled then it would prove that we shouldn't be together, but... But I didn't spiral. Despite every nerve in my body wanting to break something or hurt someone or do all the wrong things for all the right reasons, I'm holding it together the best I can for you"
37304,Elena, But you're still mad at me?
37305,Damon," Of course I'm still mad at youbecause being around you drives me nuts, and not being around you drives me nuts"
37306,Elena, Ok. Now I'm really confused.What was that for?
37307,Damon," Because I've had a really crappy day, and I needed it."
37308,Damon," Wakey, wakey. Mr...Sikes, head of corporate accounts. Oops. Sorry about that. Yeah. Can't have you mumbling any of those annoying Traveler ditties.It's a sure migraine. So here's the deal. My brother and my girl have both been kidnapped by Travelers, and I can't seem to find them anywhere. I mean, like, poof, gone, right? So besides a completely clueless hybrid in my basement and a cave full of sleeping Travelers, I've got nothing to go on except you, so I'm gonna need you to tell me where I can find your leader Markos"
37309,Damon," What's up, blondie?"
37310,Caroline," Liv and Luke aren't answering any of my… oh, my God! Mr. Sikes?"
37311,Damon, You know him?
37312,Caroline, Yeah. He helped me open my first savings account. He gave me a lollipop
37313,Damon," Well, unfortunately, Mr. Sikes here is occupied by some low-life Traveler. I saw him and his buddies chanting in the town square last week. I also know that Markos and your passengered comrades are planning some big flashy spell to undo some super boring ancient witch curse, and where that sucks for us, it just happens to undo all witch magic, i.e. k*ll me and my sexy, blond frenemy here"
37314,Caroline," If you know where Markos took Stefan and Elena, you need to tell us"
37315,Damon," Yep. Sorry. You're gonna have to speak up. Mmm. Nope, nope. Didn't catch that either. I think he's trying to say something to me. Come here, sweetie pie"
37316,Man, It doesn't matter where Markos is. Nothing you do can stop him now
37317,Elena, You have...enough. Let me go
37318,Markos, I'll have enough when you can no longer speak
37319,Stefan, Who's there?
37320,Woman, Shh. Get out of here. Go
37321,Elena, Stefan
37322,Stefan, Elena
37323,Damon, Seriously? Collect calls are still a thing?
37324,Stefan," Yeah. Well, you know what could have saved you the cost of this phone call? You finding us. How long have we been gone?"
37325,Damon, 4 days
37326,Stefan," 4 days? 4 days, and you couldn't track us down? What'd you think? We were having a nice spa getaway?"
37327,Damon," Whoa, whoa, whoa. I've been searching 24/7, ok? Maybe if you'd been a little more perceptive, you wouldn't have gotten yourselves doppelnapped. What the hell was that?"
37328,Stefan," Travelers drained us of our bl*od, so we've had to do a little bit of hunting"
37329,Damon, You have Elena participating in squirrel slaughter?
37330,Stefan, Believe me; she's no happier about it than I am
37331,Damon, She'll sh**t your eye out
37332,Stefan," Do you want to talk to her, or are you still pretending like you don't want to hear her voice?"
37333,Damon," Don't psychoanalyze me, Stefan. Where are you? I'll come get you"
37334,Stefan," I have no idea where we are. We're in the middle of nowhere. Listen. We'll make our way back, but Markos drained most of our bl*od, and considering the kinds of spells he was able to do with just a little bit of it..."
37335,Damon," Yeah, I know. Find Markos; k*ll Markos, save Mystic Falls from becoming Traveler home. It's gonna be a busy day for me, Stefan. Time to strap on the hero hair"
37336,Stefan," I'll get her home safely, all right?"
37337,Damon," Get both yourselves home safely, brother. I'd hate to have to kick her ass for losing you"
37338,Enzo, Forgetting someone?
37339,Damon, Bonnie!
37340,Bonnie, He says you promised you bring him back
37341,Enzo," Uh, you're paraphrasing. He said, quote, I will find a way"
37342,Bonnie, Whatever
37343,Damon," Hello. Still here,and I know what I said"
37344,Enzo, Hey. Remind him he doesn't have a very good track record for keeping promises
37345,Bonnie, Please stop talking
37346,Enzo, The other side is on the brink of collapse. I plan on pestering all of you until I'm safely returned to the land of the living
37347,Bonnie, You need to fix this before I lose my mind
37348,Damon," Hey. I'm sorry, ok? I've got two missing doppelgangers, I've got a Traveler that wants to rid our town of magic, and I've got the friendly banker Mr. Sikes in the coat closet, so escape from the netherworld's gonna have to wait until tomorrow"
37349,Bonnie, I think he wants to be penciled in for today
37350,Damon, Then you bring him back
37351,Bonnie, What?
37352,Damon," Liv is cooking up a spell to pull you back from the other side before it goes kaboom, so whatever you're doing, just include Enzo in it. You hear me, Enzo? Just hitch a ride with her, ok?See? There delegating. I feel better"
37353,Bonnie, That's not a great idea
37354,Jeremy, You called
37355,Damon, You. I need you and your Xbox buddy to run an errand for me. Come on. Let's go
37356,Enzo," Well, what are you waiting for? Ring up your little witchy friend and get her over here"
37357,Elena, Ohh. I feel like an idiot
37358,Stefan, Ditto
37359,Elena, Do that thing again. The vamp thing
37360,Stefan," Oh, no. I don't want to do that. Come on. You know it's embarrassing"
37361,Elena, Come on. It's the only thing that's keeping me sane right now
37362,Stefan, Sure
37363,Elena, Hmm. That was funnier the first time
37364,Stefan," Yeah. Well, you were delirious the first time"
37365,Elena," How many, um… ahem… you know, are we supposed to have before we get our strength back?"
37366,Stefan," More than we've had, that's for sure. Let me know if you see a damn buffalo"
37367,Elena, This is depressing
37368,Stefan, Yeah. More depressing than walking for miles and not knowing where the hell you're going?
37369,Elena," No, probably not more depressing than that"
37370,Stefan, Damon is in full hero mode today
37371,Elena, I'm sure he was thrilled about that
37372,Stefan, I don't know. He had the whole savior of the universe voice going on
37373,Elena," I like that voice. You know, maybe this whole thing's a sign"
37374,Stefan, A sign of what?
37375,Elena, My bl*od can literally destroy him. If that's not a sign that we're in a toxic relationship…
37376,Stefan," Our bl*od, all right, our bl*od. Don't hog the blame. Look. We're vampires. We're a toxic species. Whether you want to blame it on magic or biology, it's just who we are. When a human gets ravenously hungry, they eat a double cheeseburger. We k*ll people. Some of us are more extreme than others, but that's just who we are"
37377,Elena, How come you're so much better at controlling it?
37378,Stefan," Because I'm so much worse when I don't. I'm only gonna say this once. You two are miserable without each other, so if you want to be with him, just be with him. Look. When humans want to break free from complicated relationships, they go to therapy. Vampires get a pass, ok? Come on"
37379,Liv, I ordered us waffles. I figured our last meal wouldn't be complete until we poured liquid sugar all over it
37380,Luke, Mmm. My ray of sunshine sister
37381,Liv," The coven's pissed, Luke. You were supposed to hide Stefan and Elena from the Travelers, and you practically delivered them on a silver platter"
37382,Luke, Ok. How was I supposed to know that Casper the English ghost would be a complication
37383,Liv," That's not the point. We were never supposed to let things get this far. We got sucked into some stupid ""let's be friends"" trap"
37384,Luke," Look. These people are nice, ok, more than I can say for our screwed up family. What are you doing?"
37385,Liv,"It's not me. Like I said, the coven is pissed"
37386,Luke, Fine. I'm listening
37387,Liv, We were supposed to keep the doppelgangers from falling into Markos' hands. We failed. We can't let him succeed at taking away our magic. There's only one move left. We have to k*ll Stefan and Elena
37388,Luke, Yeah…
37389,Mrs. Douglas," Morning, Sam"
37390,Mailman," Mrs. Douglas, special delivery"
37391,Man, Mailman didn't deliver anything?
37392,Mrs. Douglas, Nope. Just picking up. I'm going to be late for school. I've got a million college essays to review
37393,Man," What's going on, Pam? Something's wrong. You're different lately"
37394,Mrs. Douglas, I think what's wrong is the fact that it's taken you so long to notice that your wife has been colonized by a total stranger
37395,Man, You think I'm joking? I'm serious
37396,Mrs. Douglas, So am I. My name's Karl.I'm a Traveler living inside your wife's body while my real body is asleep in a cave under the town
37397,Man, What are you talking about?
37398,Mrs. Douglas," This isn't my first choice, but I need to borrow something that's expendable"
37399,Man," Pam, you need help"
37400,Mrs. Douglas, This marriage was a disaster anyway. No hard feelings
37401,Elena, I think I just hallucinated a unicorn
37402,Stefan, Maybe Caroline's nearby
37403,Elena," Heh. If Caroline was here, we'd have a fully catered buffet on the side of the road and a rainbow"
37404,Stefan, Two rainbows
37405,Elena," That's funny. Ha!You know, when we were younger, I couldn't decide what was more annoying… her control freakiness or her delusional positivity, but right now honestly, there isn't a single person I wish was here more"
37406,Stefan, Her control freakiness never really bugged me
37407,Elena," Yeah. Well, you didn't have to build a Barbie castle with her in the second grade"
37408,Stefan," That's true. I do know this. If Caroline Forbes was here right now, we would both be laughing"
37409,Elena," We're so pathetic. You know what? Let's put on your best Caroline Forbes hats, shall we? All right, universe, enough screwing around. We're ready for the good stuff. Theme dance or block party maybe"
37410,Stefan, You got to be kidding me
37411,Elena," What? Oh, my God.That is so weird. Oh no wait. See?"
37412,Stefan, Right…
37413,Elena, H--oh. Not what I was expecting
37414,Stefan, All right. Let's cut to the chase. You're giving us a ride
37415,Maria, You're trying to compel me? Who do you think freed you last night? Get in. They're coming for you
37416,Damon," Ah, great.I'm gonna add carry to the list of things that you can't do well, but that's ok. You can pay me back with your salary from the grill if you want to work a couple thousand years"
37417,Matt, Why don't you do us all a favor and start dating Elena again?
37418,Damon, Just put her on the pool table
37419,Caroline, What the hell is going on? Who are all these people?
37420,Damon," Traveler husks. They've passengered themselves into the beautiful citizens of Mystic Falls like your buddy Mr. Sikes. You two, make yourselves useful. Patrol the town. Call me if you see anything weirder than usual"
37421,Caroline, And what are you planning on doing with all of them?
37422,Damon," Here you go. Oh, yeah. Well, Markos put them in a cave. I'm hoping he wants them back"
37423,Caroline, So you think drawing Markos to your house is the best idea?
37424,Damon, It's the only idea unless your body-snatched ex-boyfriend in the basement can help us
37425,Caroline," Julian is not Tyler. Therefore, he has no reason to help us, so until I figure out a way to get Tyler back, he's just extra baggage"
37426,Damon," There's no shame in giving up. I mean, aren't we all a little sick of Tyler?"
37427,Caroline," You know what? Your whole I'm too cool to care thing is really starting to get old, and don't think for one second that I believe your mood has nothing to do with Elena"
37428,Damon, Spare me the unsolicited relationship advice
37429,Caroline, Fine. Just keep your torture-happy hands off of Tyler until I figure something out. I don't abandon the people that I care about
37430,Maria," It was too risky to haul you out of there myself, so I had to circle back"
37431,Stefan, Won't they k*ll you for helping us out?
37432,Maria," Yes, which is why we need to make sure that they don't get to me before I get to my husband. I assume you know where he is"
37433,Elena," Well, seeing as how he's permanently passengered into one of our best friends, yeah. This isn't really a 3-person kind of truck, is it?"
37434,Maria, You can always sit in your boyfriend's lap
37435,Elena, We're not together
37436,Stefan, She's not my girlfriend
37437,Maria," Noted. Sorry I assumed. I thought the doppelgangers were, like, fated soul mates or something"
37438,Stefan, Something like that
37439,Elena," So you want your husband back. I get it, but didn't he run from Markos, too? Doesn't that make you guys both dead?"
37440,Maria, Markos is focused on breaking the curse so that the Travelers can settle permanently in your hometown. I'll have a head start if I can get to Julian before Markos starts the spell
37441,Stefan, We're not just gonna let you take Tyler
37442,Maria," Tyler is gone. There's only Julian now, and he belongs with me. Once the spell starts, magic will be stripped away layer by layer. Tyler's body will turn from hybrid back to werewolf, but then finally, he'll just be dead, and my husband along with him. So leaving him behind is not an option"
37443,Tyler/Julian, Quit hovering. It's weird
37444,Caroline," You're, like, permanently inhabiting the former love of my life. Let's debate the levels of weird"
37445,Tyler/Julian," If he's former, why do you care?"
37446,Caroline, Because he's a person whose life you stole without asking. He deserves to be fought for
37447,Tyler/Julian, Whatever
37448,Caroline, So why can't Markos and all the other Travelers find someplace else to live?
37449,Tyler/Julian," It's nice here. Besides, it's not just about breaking the curse that keeps us from being able to settle. It's revenge against everything the witches stand for, every grimoire, every talisman, every vampire, right down to your daylight rings. The Travelers see it all as a perversion of pure magic. Markos wants to destroy that perversion. He wants to restore the balance"
37450,Caroline, But that's just wrong
37451,Tyler/Julian," It's not really wrong when you think about it. If anything, it's kind of right"
37452,Caroline, Why does he have to be so violent about it?
37453,Tyler/Julian," When it comes to getting what he wants, Markos doesn't have much of a sense of humor"
37454,Damon, Nothing…
37455,Damon, Salvatore boring house
37456,Markos, I'm calling about my people
37457,Damon," Hey. You found my note. Now listen. Don't be offended, but I can't just give them to anyone, so what do they look like?"
37458,Markos," They're ragged, b*at down by the world, desperate for a home"
37459,Damon," You just described homeless people, aging hipsters, and Matt Donovan"
37460,Markos," One of them is 5'10"", wearing a black coat. You're standing next to him"
37461,Damon," I know the concept of a home is new to you, but it is polite to knock"
37462,Caroline," So Julian is trapped inside of Tyler forever or until he dies, so I was thinking what if he does die? Maybe that's how we do it, that's how we get him out"
37463,Bonnie, You want to k*ll Tyler?
37464,Caroline," Well, he'll go to the other side, and then when Liv does the spell to help you and Enzo, Tyler can come back. And speaking of, shouldn't you be, like, preparing or talking to Liv or doing anything other than packing up our dorm room?"
37465,Bonnie," We have to be out of here right after finals, which I might skip due to the potential extinction of magic in the place where I was spending my summer break"
37466,Caroline," Right, but I think the other side falling apart is slightly more pressing than a late housing fee"
37467,Bonnie," There is no spell. I made it up. The other side is collapsing, and everyone in it, including me, is going away for good. So, no, I don't think you should k*ll Tyler"
37468,Markos, Nice place.A little rustic. My tastes are more modern ironically. Still... Good bones and all
37469,Damon,"I think you read the flier wrong. See, the bodies are the only thing on the bargaining table and in the attic and the garage and the kitchen"
37470,Markos," About that. Please tell me taking hostages isn't your grand plan because it feels a little small, much like the half bathroom off the foyer"
37471,Damon," Funny. Here I thought you didn't have a sense of humor. Oh. If you're wondering about the smell, I have your salvation army doused in gasoline, and I am just itching to light a match"
37472,Markos," You're right. None of this would be possible without their willingness to passenger themselves into your citizens and help perform my spell, and while I'd like to give them the opportunity to return to their actual bodies… It's not essential to my plan. Did you really think you'd found the whole of my people? Travelers are everywhere.They're the faces that surround you every day the world over, the ones you don't notice because you're too busy making a mess of all that you have. They want those things, too… a home, a family, a better life… and they're willing to die for it"
37473,Damon," You want a promised land. I get it, ok, but look. Off the record, I mean, Mystic Falls is kind of a dump… bad schools, terrible traffic, and forget about ever getting a decent cup of coffee"
37474,Markos," Mystic Falls is a means to an end, like a small pebble dropped into a very large pond"
37475,Damon, Very poetic. No idea what it means
37476,Markos," Once we destroy the spirit magic in this town, the witches' curse will finally be broken. From there, the spell will ripple outward, unraveling spirit magic as it spreads. Only pure magic, our magic, will remain. My people will be free to go wherever they choose, and when witch magic and all that it has ever created is gone from this earth, you will be, too"
37477,Damon, I think I've heard about enough
37478,Markos, You underestimate me. I've completely transfused myself with doppelganger bl*od. I'm channeling all the power of my people. You're not strong enough to k*ll me anymore. Not that it matters. The spell has already g*n
37479,Maria," Home, sweet, home"
37480,Elena," I don't meant to be rude, but would you mind if I drained your carotid of a few ounces?"
37481,Maria," You're two blocks from home. Would you mind holding out, considering I saved your lives? Word of advice, keep a low profile. This is exactly where Markos doesn't want you to be. If a Traveler spots you, you're going right back to that camp"
37482,Stefan, Look out!
37483,Elena, What the hell is she doing?
37484,Maria, Trying to k*ll you. Just a wild guess
37485,Stefan, Get out of the car. Unlock the doors!
37486,Maria, I did!
37487,Elena, Stop!
37488,Maria, I can't!
37489,Elena, Oh my god
37490,Liv," I'm sorry, I really am, but we need to make the doppelganger bl*od useless. One you needs to die"
37491,Luke, It doesn't matter which one really
37492,Enzo," When did you plan on telling me, or were you just hoping the darkness would come take me before the awful truth came out? Answer me!"
37493,Bonnie, Don't you get it? There is no solution
37494,Enzo," There's always a solution. Your boyfriend came back from the dead, Markos came back from the dead, you came back from the dead!"
37495,Bonnie," The Travelers used doppelganger bl*od in that spell to bring Markos back, which means they basically destroyed the magic that was holding the other side together. It's unraveling, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. It is over, Enzo.You're not coming back. Accept it"
37496,Enzo," I will accept it when that darkness comes and yanks me into oblivion. I will accept when I no longer exist. I spent over 50 years stuck in a cell, poked, prodded, tortured. By all rights, I had no hope of ever getting out, but I clung to it, so I will accept it when it's done and not a minute prior"
37497,Bonnie, I know you. You tried to k*ll my boyfriend in the caves
37498,Enzo, What's going on?
37499,Bonnie, A Traveler just died
37500,Maria, Please tell my husband I tried
37501,Damon, I'd invite you to stay for dinner but I’m not very familiar with the traveler cuisine although I'm sure it involves lots of trail mix and gruel
37502,Markos, I think I'll take this wall down. I love an open floor plan
37503,Tyler/Julian, Damon. He doesn't know I'm here. Use the element of surprise. Not sure you're clever enough to pull it off. Just thought I'd put it out there
37504,Damon," Well, all I can ask is that you leave me with a couple great bottles of wine. You know, I spent half my life shoplifting the stuff. I'm assuming you want to see the wine cellar"
37505,Damon, Ah. Here's something you don't see every day. Bordeaux 1945.I think I won this in a poker game. I don't know. Maybe Stefan brought it back from the w*r. I don't remember
37506,Markos, Where is your brother? I was hoping he'd be here. The doppelgangers seemed to have slipped away without saying good-bye
37507,Damon," Well, that's a good question. Why don't we find out?After you"
37508,Luke," Do it. Liv, come on"
37509,Liv, No hard feelings. Just following our coven's orders
37510,Luke," Liv! Liv, what's happening?"
37511,Liv," Oh, no"
37512,Elena, Your magic sputter out?
37513,Liv," Luke, it's started. The spell's started"
37514,Elena, We trusted you
37515,Liv, It doesn't matter.You're gonna be dead any second
37516,Stefan, Elena!
37517,Elena," Stefan, our rings aren't working"
37518,Stefan, Get inside. Run now!
37519,Matt," Elena, hey, what happened?"
37520,Elena, Our rings aren't working
37521,Matt, What?!
37522,Stefan, Whole town square's filled with Travelers. We got to get out of here
37523,Matt, The tunnels. In the stockroom. Come on. Let's go
37524,Matt, Elena! What's going on?
37525,Stefan," The spell unravels the witch magic. It's spreading, and without the magic, I'm just someone who was sh*t by his dad"
37526,Matt, All right. Come on. Let's keep running. Maybe we'll stay ahead of it
37527,Damon," Well, Stefan isn't picking up, so he might just be out of cell phone minutes"
37528,Markos, What kind of game are you playing?
37529,Damon, Took you long enough
37530,Tyler/Julian, My fangs. What the hell happened to my fangs?
37531,Damon, Damon .We have a problem
37532,Markos," Now what were you saying about this being your home? Like I said, the spell will continue to unravel spirit magic as it spreads, which means you're not long for this world. The sun's about to set. Feel free to buy yourself a little time to say your good-byes. You and this traitor of yours can try to outrun the spell for a little while anyway"
37533,Damon," Little Gilbert, I have never been so happy to see you"
37534,Jeremy, Get in
37535,Caroline," What are we even supposed to take… photos, clothes, hair products? Like any of that matters when we're all dead! Why are you just sitting there?"
37536,Bonnie, I'm thinking
37537,Caroline," Well, think while you pack. Death is literally on its way. You said a vampire appeared to you who died on old Miller Road, which means the spell is moving past Mystic Fall. So whatever will fit. The rest I'm sure we'll never see again. Hello, Bonnie! Which part of we're all about to die isn't registering?"
37538,Bonnie, I think I know how to get us all back form the other side. I need to find Enzo
37539,Matt, These are all the bl*od bags I could get my hands on
37540,Elena," Thanks. Between the 4 of us, that will last a day"
37541,Matt, Then what?
37542,Stefan," That's a tomorrow problem. Right now, we just got to outrun the spell, regroup in about 1,000 miles, and then figure out a game plan"
37543,Elena, You ok
37544,Damon, What was that for?
37545,Elena," I had a really crappy day, and I needed it. I thought I was never gonna see you again, and I couldn't think of a worse way to die"
37546,Damon," Well, I guess today's your lucky day"
37547,Stefan," Jeremy, you head back with Matt. We need eyes and ears in Mystic Falls. You guys take Jeremy's car. I'm gonna wait here for Caroline and Bonnie"
37548,Elena," I'll call you in a few hours, Jer"
37549,Jeremy, Be careful
37550,Enzo," Surreal, isn't it?"
37551,Maria, Who are you?
37552,Enzo," Dead just like you, but I've got a proposition to get us both out of this place"
37553,Maria, What are you talking about?
37554,Enzo, Markos managed to Houdini his way back to the land of the living with some crazy spell. Any chance you know it?
37555,Maria," I know the spell, but I don't know two dozen Travelers willing to overwhelm the anchor"
37556,Enzo, I think you underestimate how resourceful we are. Just leave the details to us. What do you say? Interested?
37557,Maria, What the hell is happening?
37558,Enzo, Grab my hand! Hold on! No!
37559,Bonnie, What's wrong?
37560,Enzo, We hit a little snag
37561,Caroline, Where's Bonnie? She was right behind me
37562,Stefan, I'm gonna find out what's taking so long
37563,Tyler/Julian, I'm looking for Maria. I heard she brought you back to Mystic Falls
37564,Stefan," Uh, yeah, she did"
37565,Tyler/Julian, Did she tell you where she was headed? Because she can't stay there. The town's completely overrun. What's the problem? Did she tell you where she was headed or what?
37566,Stefan," Listen. Uh, you're not gonna see Maria again"
37567,Tyler/Julian, What are you talking about?
37568,Stefan, She's dead. I'm sorry
37569,Tyler/Julian, Don't touch me
37570,Caroline, It wasn't Stefan's fault
37571,Tyler/Julian, She saved your punk ass
37572,Stefan, I wasn't the one who k*ll her the witches did
37573,Tyler/Julian," Well, someone's gonna have to pay for it"
37574,Stefan," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa. I'm in no mood to fight tonight, all right?"
37575,Tyler/Julian, Look at me.My wife's dead. I'm in somebody else's body. I've got nowhere to go because my own people are trying to k*ll me
37576,Stefan," Listen. We're gonna find a way to stop this spell. Even if Mystic Falls is gone, we're gonna find a way to save ourselves, all right?"
37577,Tyler/Julian, There. Dead doppelganger. Stopped the spell
37578,Caroline," Oh, my God. Oh, my God! No, no"
37579,Bonnie, What the hell happened? Maria was the only one who was willing to help us who knew that spell
37580,Enzo," The great beyond happened, and it's gonna keep happening, so we need to find a way out of here and fast"
37581,Bonnie, Stefan…
37582,Enzo, What ?
37583,Stefan, Bonnie
37584,Bonnie, This—this can't be happening
37585,Stefan, Please tell me that you figured out a way to bring us all back
37586,Bonnie, I lost it. I'm sorry
37587,Caroline," Somebody, help me! Please. Oh, my God. No. Somebody, help! Somebody, help!"
37588,Elena," Oh, my God. Stefan! She sits on the coffee table in front of the body. Caroline: (sobbing) I didn't know where to bring him, and I just couldn't leave him outside. "
37589,Caroline," Bonnie has a plan, right? She--she said that she could bring people back. (either Elena or Damon respond) Tell me that she can bring him back! Damon: We'll bring him back. Come on. Let's get away from prying eyes. "
37590,Woman, I got you! 
37591,Lexi, Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness. I think you owe me a beer. 
37592,TITLE CARD & OPENING CREDITS,
37593,Bonnie," Damon, stop. "
37594,Damon," You said you had a plan, Bonnie. "
37595,Bonnie, I did. I had a traveler who knew the right spell. 
37596,Damon, And you lost her! 
37597,Bonnie, I didn't lose her. She was sucked into oblivion like everyone else on the Other Side. 
37598,Damon, Then find another one! 
37599,Bonnie, It's more than just knowing the spell. Markos was able to come back because dozens of Travelers were willing to sacrifice themselves in order to overwhelm me. I doubt they'll be willing to do that for a bunch of supernatural strangers. 
37600,Damon," (pointing at her with the rod) You know who needs motivation? (he gets close to her with the rod pointing at her neck) You need motivation because if the Other Side goes away, everyone we know there, including you, goes away with it. "
37601,Bonnie, I know that. Do you think I want to die? 
37602,Damon, My brother is over there. 
37603,Bonnie, I know that! 
37604,Damon," So is Alaric, and so is your grams. "
37605,Bonnie," I know that, Damon. "
37606,Enzo, *ahem* Let's not forget who else is at the top of the search and rescue list. Bonnie: Enzo is here. 
37607,Damon," Well, if it's not Mr. Butterfingers himself. How'd it feel to have your only hope of coming back literally slip through your fingers? "
37608,Enzo," Hello to you, too, grumpy pants. (to Bonnie) Tell him to play nice. I have a plan. "
37609,Bonnie, (to Enzo) Are you serious? You found another Traveler? 
37610,Damon," (in Enzo's direction) Well, then get on it! "
37611,Enzo," I'm already on it, mate. You still need someone to do this coming back from the dead spell. I assume you still have a witch or two in your pocket "
37612,Bonnie, More or less. 
37613,Liv, Oh great. Grandma just passed us. 
37614,Luke," If you want to drive, just say so. "
37615,Liv," No. I want you to drive, just at a speed more fitting for two people who just tried to commit m*rder. "
37616,Luke, They are not following us. Markos stripped the town of spirit magic. There's now way they survived it. 
37617,Liv, (looking straight ahead) Something tells me they did. 
37618,Luke, And I bet if I turn around... 
37619,Liv, Using our own tricks against us. (she takes off her seat belt) Jerks. 
37620,Elena," A little tip. If you're gonna flee the scene of the crime, take back roads. "
37621,Liv," Do you really want to do this, again? "
37622,Elena, You mean the part where you try to k*ll a doppelgänger? There's no point. Stefan's already dead. 
37623,Liv," I know you don't believe me, but I *am* sorry. "
37624,Elena, Good because you're gonna help bring him back. 
37625,Liv," Look. I get what you need from us, but if both doppelgängers are alive again, the Travelers can restart their spell. Witch magic goes bye-bye, and all you vamps, you're goners. "
37626,Elena," They're not gonna have a chance to start again because in order to bring Stefan back, we're gonna have to k*ll them, a lot of them, including Markos. "
37627,Luke," We can't help you. Even if we wanted to, our coven would k*ll us. "
37628,Caroline, Stefan saved your life. 
37629,Luke," I know he did, but-- "
37630,Liv, We can't risk it. 
37631,Liv, No! 
37632,Caroline, Your brother's officially on the Other Side. Think you can risk it now? 
37633,Markos," It is a good day, Sheriff. "
37634,Liz, Maybe for you. It took me all night to evacuate the 10-mile civilian radius around the Town Square. 
37635,Markos, Hmm. Gas leak. Very clever. I appreciate your cooperation. 
37636,Liz, It will keep our residents away for now but certainly not forever. 
37637,Markos, I'm sure we can think of something if we put our heads together. 
37638,Liz, Why did they move our sign? 
37639,Markos," Our desire was to end spirit magic everywhere. As you can see, we hit a snag. Nevertheless, this is our home now, and just to keep things simple, we've reset the official border of Mystic Falls to where the spell begins, right there. "
37640,Liz," Of all the small towns to call home, you probably shouldn't have picked one full of vampires. "
37641,Markos, You think I'm afraid of vampires? Maybe you think your friend Damon or your daughter can come save the day. (they start walking) Let me give you an example of why that would be unwise. 
37642,Liz," Tyler! Markos: Oh, that's not Tyler anymore. That's Julian, the Traveler who betrayed his people when he k*ll the dopplegänger and stopped the spell. A big, scary werewolf-vampire hybrid, and yet a little vervain, a touch of wolfsbane, and here you are -- weak and all mine. "
37643,Julian," You think you're some great leader because you pillage a helpless town? That makes you king now? Sorry, your highness, but I don't buy it. "
37644,Markos," That's because you haven't set foot inside my kingdom. (Julian looks at him confused; Markos turns around) The spell the Travelers cast across Mystic Falls eliminates spirit magic, so while my people continue to have access to the Earth's purest magic, (he turns to face Julian/Tyler again) your friend Tyler will be stripped of everything the witches did to him, first his hybrid side, then his vampirism, and with no vampirism to keep him alive, he'll just be a boy with a werewolf gene, who happened to break his neck. Julian: No, no! No! (the men holding him try to hold him tighter as Julian tries to break free) Don't do this! No! No! Stop. (they force Julian to cross the city limit) "
37645,Liz," Oh, my God. "
37646,Enzo, One less witch twin in the world. 
37647,Bonnie, (now facing Enzo) No. One more person we need to bring back. 
37648,Enzo, This list is getting uncomfortably long. 
37649,Bonnie," Tell me about it, but with Liv doing the spell, not bring her brothe back would be just-- "
37650,Enzo," Smart, savvy? "
37651,Bonnie," Cruel. It would be cruel, but none of it matters if your mysterious Traveler doesn't show. "
37652,Tyler, (off screen) Bonnie? 
37653,Bonnie," (disconcerted, she looks behind her and sees Tyler) Tyler, is that you? "
37654,Tyler, How the hell did I get here? 
37655,Bonnie," You're dead, and you're you. Caroline was right. (they walk closer to each other) Dying eliminated your passenger. "
37656,Tyler, Hang on. Did you say I'm dead? 
37657,Bonnie," I did, but we can bring you back. "
37658,Enzo, And the list keeps growing. 
37659,Bonnie," I need you to trust me, OK? "
37660,Tyler, Do I have a choice? 
37661,Damon," Class is in session. First assignment -- Anti-magic perimeter. Gilbert, what do you got? "
37662,Jeremy, I walked around Mystic Falls this morning to see where my hunter instincts disappeared. 
37663,Damon," Meaning what, your biceps shrunk, and your brain got smaller? "
37664,Jeremy," Meaning that I have a supernatural urge to k*ll vampires, so wherever I hated you less, there was no magic. "
37665,Damon," (they look down at a map of Mystic Falls, which has a big red circle drawn on it to determine the limits of the no-magic area) The cemetery's outside of the no-magic perimeter, a couple of un-populated areas other than that. "
37666,Caroline," (on the phone, on speaker) Hey, Professor Salvatore, not everyone can see the map. "
37667,Elena," (also on the phone) Yeah, don't forget about us. "
37668,Damon," Donovan, you had one job. "
37669,Matt, I'll send you a picture right now. 
37670,Elena, (into Caroline's phone) We should be there. 
37671,Damon," Nope. You should not be. You are on witch duty because without crazy locks, no one's rising from the dead. So next order of business, mass m*rder. Quaterback? "
37672,Damon," Thank you. OK. We got these from the Sheriff. Apparently there was some truth to her evacuation story. There's a major gas line that runs underneath the town. Now if it did leak, it could be deadly, as in massive expl*si*n kind of deadly. "
37673,Matt, We can't blow up our hometown. 
37674,Damon, Says one of the only people left in this group who can actually live there. 
37675,Elena, We're not blowing up our town. We just need to lure enough Travelers to one spot. 
37676,Caroline, How? We can't lure anyone anywhere stuck out here. 
37677,Damon," And that's where your mama comes in. She will convince them to gather somewhere inside. Meanwhile, these two geniuses at 7:00 will turn on the gas, let it leak. We'll have about 10 minutes before anyone can smell it. You clear out. Boom! Travelers gone, resurrection spell starts, loved ones return. Good? Good? Class dismissed. "
37678,Lexi," Huh. I thought for sure he'd be here. If you were a history teacher turned vampire, where else would you be? "
37679,Stefan, You seem very intent on finding somebody you barely know. 
37680,Lexi," Well, I have a thing for day drinkers. Plus he has a cute name. Alaric. Hmm. "
37681,Stefan, (leaning on the bar and smiling) We'll find him. 
37682,Lexi, (looking down at a plate of food on the bar) Seriously? This is what I ave to look forward to when I come back to life? All-you-can-eat potato skins? 
37683,Stefan, Hmm. 
37684,Lexi, Remind me again why you never made it to Portland. 
37685,Stefan, I was attacked by Silas and locked in a safe to drown for 3 months. 
37686,Lexi," Right, and then you made it out, and yet you're still here. "
37687,Stefan," Lexi, either one of us could blink out of existence any second, so if you have something to say to me-- "
37688,Lexi, Caroline. 
37689,Stefan, What about Caroline? 
37690,Lexi," Wow! You really don't see it, do you? Stefan: See what? "
37691,Liz," Listen. I might not carry a lot of weight with you people, but I am still the Sheriff and I still represent the people who live here. Markos: Travelers haven't been able to gather together for centuries. The last thing they'll tolerate is a list if your ground rules. "
37692,Liz, (looking around) What if there's an open bar? 
37693,Stefan, (to Lexi) She's trying to gather the Travelers. They're planning something. 
37694,Jeremy, I should go with you. 
37695,Bonnie," You need to go be a younger, hotter Bruce Willis, and if I take one step into Mystic Falls, good-bye magic, good-bye anchor, good-bye me. "
37696,Jeremy, At least tell me how this works. 
37697,Bonnie," Being an anchor is like being a gateway. Usually, it's one way, but when the Travelers die, Liv will do the spell, and her magic combined with all those Travelers opening the gate at once will allow the people on the Other Side to push their way through me like Markos did. "
37698,Jeremy, (concerned) What about you? What happens? 
37699,Bonnie, I stop being the anchor. 
37700,Jeremy," Yeah, but how do you get through? "
37701,Bonnie," (with teary eyes) Jeremy, I will be fine. Look. I got to go, OK? Be careful. (she hangs up.) "
37702,Enzo, What is your plan exactly? 
37703,Bonnie," My plan is my job.. just like the spell is yours, which apparently you suck at. Should already be on the road. "
37704,Stefan," I'm late, aren't I? My bad. I was watching some 80-year-old witch get dragged off to never, never land. It was uh-- weirdly entertaining. "
37705,Bonnie, Stefan. 
37706,Enzo," Not exactly. Bonnie, meet the Traveler with our one-way ticket out of here, although you may know him better as an ancient immortal with a desperate need of a cure. "
37707,Bonnie," Oh, my God. Silas. You k*ll my dad. "
37708,Silas," And now, I'm gonna help you bring your friends back to life and me along with them. So, what do you say? Bygones? "
37709,-- ON THE OTHER-SIDE, AT MYSTIC FALLS HIGH SCHOOL -- 
37710,Stefan, Where the hell is Alaric? 
37711,Lexi," I don't know. Maybe he finally found peace, although if he did, I'm going to be super pissed he b*at me. "
37712,Stefan," Well, why didn't you? I mean, if anyone was going to find peace, it should be you. "
37713,Lexi," I don't know. Maybe there's something I'm still supposed to do. You know, like, earn my stripes. "
37714,Stefan," All right. Let's make a deal. If all this fails and you and I are stuck over here, we're not going to let whatever's happening to all these people happen to us. We're going to find peace together. "
37715,Lexi, A death peace pact? 
37716,Lexi, I like it. 
37717,Lexi, Come on. Let's go. I would hate for you to miss your come-back-to-life window before you even had your first date with Caroline. 
37718,Stefan," Oh, shut it. "
37719,Silas, Az vezat esvet. 
37720,Bonnie (repeating the spell back to Silas), Az vezat esvat. 
37721,Silas," (correcting her) Esvet, not -vat. I feel like I'm teaching calculus to an infant. "
37722,Bonnie, I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous about unleashing a plague onto humanity. 
37723,Silas," Ooh! I've been upgraded to a plague? Oh. How biblical and fitting, seeing as I probably will k*ll a lot of people in an epic, all-inclusive way once I'm out of here. "
37724,Silas," Oh, speaking of, how is my shadow self? Is it a crime for someone so good-looking to be so sad all the time? "
37725,Bonnie, Just teach me the damn spell. 
37726,Elena, Hey. Did you find a Traveler that's going to get us out of here? 
37727,Bonnie," Yep. Learning the spell as we speak. I'd introduce you, but, um-- "
37728,Elena," (speaking to no one in particular) Thank you, whoever you are. "
37729,Silas," Oh. Just the perfect specimen of man, that's all. "
37730,Bonnie, (sarcastically) Moody old lady. Kind of senile. 
37731,Elena," Got it. Well, I'm going to go call Damon, and let him know that we're ready. "
37732,Matt, Can we talk about the irony in us blowing up the only place dumb enough to hire us? 
37733,Jeremy, I'm sure the Salvatores will make a generous contribution to help fix it. 
37734,Matt," Yeah, if they can come home. No one said k*ll the Travelers will get rid of this anti-magic thing, although Mystic Falls might be a half-decent place to live in again. No more vampire attacks, crazy bl*od rituals, you know? Safe like it use to be. "
37735,Jeremy, Except I wouldn't be able to invite my girlfriend over. 
37736,Matt," There are worse things than having to visit your girlfriend at college on the weekends, Jer. It's called ""normal."" "
37737,Jeremy, We're here. 
37738,Markos, (stepping in front of her) I warned you they probably wouldn't give you the chance to speak. 
37739,Liz," Well, they don't seem to have a problem with the free food. "
37740,Markos, (blocking her from leaving) Where are you going? 
37741,Liz," Well, I'm clearly not going to have much of an impact here, so I think it's time I take my own orders and evacuate. "
37742,Markos," We're not lawless, you know. We could use someone like you, have a drink with me. Allow me to convince you that this can still be your home. "
37743,Liz, My home is a place my daughter can come visit. Goodbye. 
37744,Markos, Please. I insist. 
37745,Elena," So are you good? Damon: Operation m*ssacre... assuming Donovan knows the difference between a water-main and a gas-main.. yeah, I'm good. "
37746,Damon," Listen.. I wanted to spare you the gory details, and then I figured, well, I'll be lying, and then the whole point of the universe would be moot because you'd be pissed. So here it is; project kaboom needs someone to trigger the expl*si*n, so-to-speak.. "
37747,Elena," Okay... wait.. you? No. Damon, no! Absolutely not. "
37748,Damon (muttering to himself)," Go with your first instinct Damon, lesson learned "
37749,Elena," Look at me, Damon. "
37750,Elena, Do you see a future with me? Because that's all I see. 
37751,Damon," Elena, I've seen it since the second I laid my eyes on you. "
37752,Elena, Then don't go on a su1c1de mission! 
37753,Damon," Listen.. technically, it's only half a su1c1de mission because we're going to be bringing people back from the other side and I'm going to be with them. "
37754,Elena," Well, what if something goes wrong? "
37755,Damon," Alright... not to relive old fights, but this is my choice. I need you to respect it. "
37756,Elena, That was a low blow... .
37757,Damon," I will make it back to you, I promise. "
37758,Damon, I promise you.. 
37759,ACT 4,
37760,Enzo, Is everything all right in there? 
37761,Bonnie," Yeah. We're good, but Silas is a crappy mentor, FYI. "
37762,Enzo, It's back. Silas (coming outside): She's ready. Let's get on with it. 
37763,Enzo (to Bonnie), Help me. 
37764,Bonnie, Bygones. 
37765,"(Liv lights candles, preparing to start the spell. She blows out a candle and looks at the clock on her phone, which reads 6",59 pm) 
37766,Luke (from the other side)," You can do this, Liv. "
37767,Matt, Alright. It's 7 o'clock on the dot. Let's go. 
37768,Bonnie," Come on, Grams. Where are you? "
37769,Sheila Bennet, Didn't I tell you not to rush your elders? We move a little slower. 
37770,Bonnie, Thank god! I found us all a way out. 
37771,Sheila Bennet," Do you think I was born yesterday? I know what you're doing. You can't survive all these people coming through you.. and even if you could, when it's all said and done, you're still the anchor, and when this places goes... "
37772,Bonnie (interrupting her), I know what you're about to say.. 
37773,Sheila Bennet, No you don't. I was going to say that it's been my privledge to watch you grow into the beautiful woman you've become. 
37774,Bonnie, You need to pass through me when the ritual begins. 
37775,Sheila Bennet, No. I'm staying here. 
37776,Bonnie, Grams.. You can't. This place is imploding and taking everyone with it. 
37777,Sheila Bennet," I can't come, Bonnie. You're not the only member of this family that knows how to make a sacrafice. "
37778,Bonnie, What does that mean? 
37779,Sheila Bennet, It means that I'm going to be fine. I found peace because I made sure that you'll find yours. 
37780,Bonnie, I don't understand... 
37781,Sheila Bennet, Not your concern. Just know that I looked out for you. 
37782,Sheila Bennet, I love you Bonnie. You stay strong. 
37783,Bonnie, I love you. 
37784,Markos, Another phone call in five minutes.. 
37785,Liz, What am I doing here? 
37786,Markos," You know, I was wondering the same thing. You evacuated the town, yet you stayed behind to lecture us on our civic duties? "
37787,Liz, A captain goes down with his ship.. 
37788,Markos, Or you're up to something. 
37789,Liz, Do you smell gas? 
37790,Liz, I think there's a leak coming from the hatch. 
37791,Damon, What the hell are you doing? 
37792,Elena," You said to respect your choice and I did. Now, I need you to respect mine. "
37793,Damon," Woah. No. No. That's not how this works, Elena. The second we cross the border, you're going to feel everything... you're going to drown all over again.. It's going to take you back to the night you died as a human. "
37794,Elena," I know what I signed up for, Damon and I'm all in. "
37795,Elena, What are you staring at? Drive! 
37796,Elena," Hurry! We have to die while we're still vampires, or.. "
37797,Damon (noticing the water), No! 
37798,Damon (crying out in frustration when he isn't moving as quick as he'd like), Come on! 
37799,Elena, Damon... 
37800,Damon, I know.. 
37801,Luke, Keep going. 
37802,Markos," We meet again... We can do this all day, Bonnie. Your friends k*ll me and I come right back through you. I look forward to the deja vu. "
37803,Elena, Bonnie! 
37804,Bonnie, Elena! Did it work? Are you? 
37805,Elena, Yes! Bonnie (in relief): Yeah? 
37806,Elena, Did Damon? 
37807,Damon (from off-screen), I'm right here. 
37808,Bonnie," Okay. When you guys pass through me, you're going to wake up with your bodies on the other side. I need you to get back here as fast as you can. "
37809,Damon, Okay. 
37810,Alaric, Did you seriously wear your seatbelt? 
37811,Elena," Oh my god! Alaric, what are you doing he... "
37812,Alaric, Come on. You gotta go. 
37813,Elena, But what about Damon? I need to find him. 
37814,Alaric," No, you need to go home to your brother. I'll find Damon. "
37815,Elena," I can't! Alaric: Go on. Elena, get out of here. Go. "
37816,Elena, Okay. 
37817,Damon, Liz! No. No. No. No 
37818,Alaric," Friendly advice: When you finally get the girl, don't blow her up! "
37819,Damon (laughing)," Good to see you too, buddy. "
37820,Alaric, Yeah 
37821,Alaric, I think she's going to be okay. 
37822,Luke, BONNIE! 
37823,Luke, Bonnie! Hey! It's too much for her. We need to start now! 
37824,Stefan, No! We need to go together. Damon isn't here yet. 
37825,Luke, I don't care. 
37826,Luke, Hey. 
37827,Luke," You need to stop, now. Okay? If you keep going, it's going to k*ll you. "
37828,Liv, No. I promised that I'd help them. LIV STARTS CHANTING AGAIN 
37829,Bonnie (to Tyler), You need to come through. 
37830,Tyler, What about everybody else? 
37831,Enzo, You don't have to tell me twice. 
37832,Enzo," Ahh! See you around, gorgeous. "
37833,Caroline, Tyler? 
37834,Tyler, Yeah! It's me. 
37835,Tyler, Woah.. 
37836,Caroline, What's wrong? 
37837,Tyler, That felt different.. 
37838,Caroline, What do you mean? 
37839,Caroline, You're not healing.. 
37840,Tyler, I'm not a hybrid anymore. 
37841,Bonnie," Come on guys, we don't have much time. Grab my hand! Lexi (to Stefan): Go. GO! "
37842,Stefan, No. 
37843,Lexi, You have to go! Come on! 
37844,Elena, I can't find Damon! 
37845,Stefan, You go. I'll wait here. 
37846,Elena, No I'm not leaving without him! 
37847,Stefan, This place is falling apart. 
37848,Elena, No! 
37849,Caroline, Elena! Thank God! 
37850,Elena, No! Bonnie! Why would you do that?! I can't leave without him! 
37851,Bonnie, We'll find him! 
37852,Caroline, Wait? What's going on? Who are we missing? Where's Stefan?! 
37853,Elena, Are you okay? 
37854,Caroline, Oh my god! Bonnie? 
37855,Stefan, No. No. No. 
37856,Caroline, Stefan! 
37857,Stefan, I was just trying... 
37858,Caroline, What's wrong? 
37859,Stefan, She fell.. I was just trying.. 
37860,Caroline, What? 
37861,Stefan, Damon.. he's not there yet. 
37862,Elena (with tears welling up in her eyes), This is not happening. 
37863,Bonnie, It's okay. I can do this. 
37864,Lexi," Bonnie; This is k*ll you, isn't it? "
37865,Bonnie, I can hold on. I have to. Just come through. We have to finish this! Markos (from off-screen): Not just yet! 
37866,Bonnie, Lexi! Come on! It's you turn! 
37867,Lexi, Every person that passes through takes you one step closer to death. What kind of a best friend would I be if you died before Stefan got his brother back? 
37868,Lexi, You're not going to get me. 
37869,Damon (from off-screen), Bonnie! 
37870,Bonnie, Thank god! 
37871,Luke, Screw those guys. 
37872,Luke, I won't let you die for them. 
37873,Luke, Fas matos veelo es mes 
37874,Damon, Where's Elena? 
37875,Bonnie, She made it through. 
37876,Damon, Okay. Bonnie: Come on 
37877,Damon," Well, would you look at that.. "
37878,Elena, Oh my god. Liv! 
37879,Elena, Bonnie! We need to find them. We need to start the spell again. Bonnie: We can't! That was our one sh*t. 
37880,Elena," Yeah, but Damon is on the other side.. we have to.. "
37881,Bonnie, ELENA... 
37882,Bonnie, It's too late. Elena: No. 
37883,Bonnie, He's here. You can say goodbye. 
37884,Stefan, I lost them both.. Two people I've known longest in this world.. both gone. 
37885,Caroline, Lexi? 
37886,Stefan," She never came out. Neither did Markos. I know that's not a conicidence. It was, uh, her, unfinished buisness. and Damon.. uh.. he finally had everything he wanted. He was happy.. He should be here. "
37887,Elena (hysterically), You lied to me. 
37888,Damon," Even if I wanted to apologize, you couldn't hear me.. so I won't. "
37889,Elena, Please don't leave me. 
37890,Damon," I don't have a choice, baby. You are, by far, the greatest thing that ever happened to me in my 173 years on this Earth. The fact that I get to die knowing that I was loved, not just by anyone, but you, Elena Gilbert. It's the epitome of a fulfilled life. It’s never gonna get any better than this. I peaked. "
37891,Damon," I love you, Elena "
37892,Elena, Please.. please.. come back to me. 
37893,Damon, Bye. 
37894,"Bonnie (to Jeremy, on the phone)"," I lied. There was never any way for me to stop being the anchor. When the other side goes, I go with it. "
37895,Jeremy, You told me you could come back. 
37896,Bonnie," If I told you the truth, it would have changed our last days together and I didn't want it to change. We were happy. "
37897,Jeremy, So none of it was true? 
37898,Jeremy," Bonnie. Don't move! Okay, I-Im coming to you. "
37899,Bonnie," I died Jer, the day before graduation. And the rest of this has been a gift. I choose to be thankful that I didn't waste a second of it. So, take care of Elena. "
37900,Jeremy, No! NO! Don't you dare hang up on me. 
37901,Bonnie (whispering), I love you 
37902,Jeremy, Bonnie. Don't you dare. 
37903,Matt, The main-gas line is off Jer.. Jer.. 
37904,Jeremy, I need to get to Bonnie. 
37905,Elena, He's gone... 
37906,Jeremy, Bonnie! Bonnie! 
37907,Tyler, What's going on? 
37908,Jeremy, Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! 
37909,Damon," This place is going down, isn't it? "
37910,Bonnie," It is. I'm sure there are a million people we'd rather be with right now, but... "
37911,Damon (joking)," A couple thousand, at most. "
37912,Bonnie, Do you think it'll hurt? 
37913,Damon, I don't kn--
37914,Elena, Please don't leave me.
37915,Jessie (whispering), What the hell was that?
37916,Male Camper, I have no idea.
37917,Jessie, Go outside and check it out.
37918,Male Camper, You go outside and check it out!
37919,Jessie (rolling her eyes), Okay...
37920,Jessie (slowly turning around), Hey... I got the lantern...
37921,Jessie (relieved), Oh my God! Sheriff Forbes... I thought you were a serial k*ll.
37922,Sheriff Forbes," Worse actually, because you'll still be alive when I call your parents."
37923,Sheriff Forbes, Pack it up and strike it down.
37924,Male Camper," I'm like, for real, Sheriff Forbes... You've got nothing better to do than bust us for a couple of beer cans? Tax money at work."
37925,Jessie," Could have been worse... Melanie Peterson was arrested for underage drinking last week. I swear, this place is turning into that town from Footloose."
37926,Male Camper," Yeah, well let's just get out of here."
37927,Male Camper, Jessie?
37928,Male Camper, Yo! Jessie!
37929,Male Camper (rushing over to her and holding her in his arms), Jessie! No No No. It's going to be okay. I'll get help!
37930,Elena (V.O.), Today was a good day. Summer is officially over and I couldn't be more thrilled.
37931,Elena (V.O.), Sophmore year... I guess this is the year to pick a major and start carving out your path in life. So that's what I did (lighting several candles). You're looking at the future Doctor Elena Gilbert.
37932,Jo, Pop quiz... Mr. Weatherly complains of chest pain and shortness of breath. Can anyone tell me what tests we run?
37933,Jo, Gilbert...
37934,Elena," Uh... a pulmonary angiogram provides a clear picture of the bl*od flow in the arteries of the lungs, which is what we look for in a pulmonary embolism; a condition in which Mr. Weatherly's symptoms are common."
37935,Jo, Good. Somebody's read ahead. Remember that. You'll need that in 3 years.
37936,Jo, Here's the bedpan you need to know about today...
37937,Jo, Moving on...
37938,Student, I was impressed...
37939,Elena, Thanks...
37940,Elena (V.O.)," Ok... so maybe I spent the day observing, but at least now we have unlimited access to bl*od bags. And trust me, we need all the help we can get."
37941,Elena," Some of us are still getting the hang of the whole ""drinking other people's bl*od"" thing"
37942,Alaric, Want some?
37943,Elena, That's alright. I had some on the way over. You know... this will never not be weird.
37944,Alaric," What? That some ancient witch turned me into a vampire, or that four months ago, I rose from the dead?"
37945,Elena, ... that you're my college professor now.
37946,Elena (V.O.)," In Alaric's defense, he couldn't exactly compell himself a job back at the high school. Nope... the high school; the grill; the town square... thanks to the traveler's anti magic spell, everything in Mystic Falls was still off-limits to anyone with fangs. A lot of us haven't been back home in months. On the plus side, the crime rate is way down."
37947,Elena (V.O.), Although I'm not sure Matt got the memo.
37948,Tripp," Good move, Donovan... Proving once again that self defense is the best offense."
37949,Elena (V.O.)," I will say he's never been better. I think he can benchpress more than Jeremy now, which is beyond freaky."
37950,Elena (V.O.)," Speaking of Jeremy... actually, let's not talk about my brother. Let's talk about Stefan."
37951,Elena (V.O.)," Last I heard, he was chasing some lead to some witch that can contact the dead."
37952,Stefan's Boss," Hey! Get your ass in here, kid. It's pay day."
37953,Elena (V.O.)," We haven't spoken in months, which can only mean his search for answers to what happened has been all-consuming."
37954,Elena (V.O.)," He's grieving... He lost so much... We all did, but we're all getting through it in our own way."
37955,Caroline (over the phone), I dropped out of Whitmore. Why would I support their stupid football team?
37956,Elena," It's the opening game of the season, Caroline. Time to come home."
37957,Caroline, I am home! I just signed the lease to my new apartment.
37958,Elena, ... On the border of a town that doesn't want you. That's not home... That's sad.
37959,Caroline, You don't even like football.
37960,Elena," No, but I like drinking in the parking lot beforehand."
37961,Tyler," Caroline, you're coming."
37962,Elena," Tyler, don't act like you have any ground to stand on. You skipped an entire year..."
37963,Tyler, and you hounded me for an entire year! So here I am... Now get your ass back here.
37964,Elena," Caroline, I'm picking you up at 6 p. m. sharp tomorrow. Okay? Bring your school spirit. Bye!"
37965,Caroline (sighs heavily)," Anyway... (to her mom) as I was saying, I haven't exactly found a spell that can undo an anti-magic border per se, but this book mentions travelers. Which isn't all that helpful, but at least it puts us a step in the right direction..."
37966,Liz, Sweetheart...
37967,Caroline, Yeah?
37968,Liz, You should go with them tomorrow.
37969,Caroline," No, we're going to go see a movie!"
37970,Liz, We have spent the entire summer together.
37971,Caroline, Ahhh. You're sick of me...
37972,Liz," Caroline, you just lost one of your best friends. It makes sense that you want to hold on to what's familiar, but Elena lost her too. She clearly misses you."
37973,Liz," No... Elena has clearly taken up residency on planet denial; where football is more important than her boyfriend being swept away into oblivion. Do you know she has barely cried for him? I mean, she was a full-on wreck over Bonnie for months, but when you mention Damon, it's like nothing ever happened."
37974,Liz," Caroline, Elena has experienced more grief than anyone I've ever met. You should cut her some slack."
37975,Caroline, What? Did someone trample over Ms. Davis' flowerbed again?
37976,Liz, Two kids were admitted to the hospital with suspicious wounds on their necks...
37977,Caroline, Vampire attacks? How? Vampires can't get into Mystic Falls.
37978,Liz," No, but they can lurk around the borders. I gotta cut lunch short... That's it. I gotta take care of this."
37979,Liz," Listen, consider Elena's offer, okay? Mystic Falls isn't going anywhere."
37980,Caroline, Hey. Don't forget your basket.
37981,Elena (V.O.),  She does't want to let go. I don't blame her... I don't want to let go either. I don't want to think that everything has changed and that I have to start over... the worst thing that could possibly happen actually did.
37982,Elena, But I don't have to. Anyway... that was my day. How was yours?
37983,Damon, Can we go back to the part where Rick came back to live to be a college professor?
37984,Alaric (writing on the blackboard in front of class), Occult: the word in its literal translation means hidden.
37985,Alaric," Therefore, the study of the occult..."
37986,Alaric," Uh... Therefore, the study of the occult is the study of the hidden knowledge. Today, we're going to discuss it and how it relates to ressurection."
37987,Alaric," Is there something funny, Liv?"
37988,Liv," Uhh. More like ironic, but okay..."
37989,Alaric, Ah. Mr. Lockwood... How generous of the squad to lend you to us.
37990,Tyler, Sorry I'm late.
37991,Alaric, Typically not all occult groups held a consensus on the topic.
37992,Tyler, (He looks at Liv's text but she covers it immediately) Sorry princess. Just trying to check what page we're on.
37993,Liv," Shh, I'm trying to listen."
37994,Alaric," (Continues his lecture) ...Apostles, Athanasian Creeds Tertullian..."
37995,Alaric," ...and the western church were inclined to believe in resurrection of the flesh, whereas the Gnostics held the firm belief that resurrection existed inly in a spiritual sense. (He turns back to his students and whispers so only Elena can hear him thanks to her vampire hearing) Elena, you know I can smell that, right? (Elena startles and stops drinking bl*od from a bottle) I'm teaching a class full of kids who all look like bl*od sausages to me. Now, put that away."
37996,Elena, (whispering) Sorry.
37997,Alaric," Uh, whereas others like the early church Fathers..."
37998,Elena," Luke, hey."
37999,Luke," Hey, I gotta run, actually."
38000,Elena," Oh, no, I'll be quick. Really quick. I just... I've been really thirsty lately. Do you think it's because of the... you know."
38001,Luke," Are you asking me if there are side effects to the ancient psychotropic herbs I've been giving you, because there haven't exactly been clinical trials."
38002,Elena," (laughs) Oh, obviously. I don't... I was just wondering if maybe you could, like, I don't know... Add something to the next batch?"
38003,Luke, Yeah or maybe there shouldn't be a next batch.
38004,Elena," Luke, it was your idea that I see him again, remember? You were all, Hey Elena, I'm sorry that I wronged you. I'm sorry that I'm the reason your boyfriend is dead, remember?"
38005,Luke," I am. I'm sorry. Something I made clear when I made Alaric's daytime bracelet, because you asked."
38006,Elena," Yeah, I know."
38007,Luke, And when I went against my coven rules to get these herbs - because you asked.
38008,Elena, Right...
38009,Luke, (cuts off) But it's time to return to reality.
38010,Elena," Luke, I'm fine. I'm okay, I promise. Just come by my place by 5, okay?"
38011,Luke, Elena... (he's about to say something but Elena doesn't let him)
38012,Elena, Thank you.
38013,Stefan," (he speaks as he gets into his boss's garage) Hey, Dean. I think a zero might've fallen off my paycheck."
38014,Dean," (doesn't look at Stefan while fixing a car) Oh yeah, I had to dock you 200 bucks."
38015,Stefan, For what?
38016,Dean, Dan Zimmer said you put a ding on the hood of his Shelby.
38017,Stefan, Dan's wife put a ding on the hood of his Shelby.
38018,Dean, That's funny. Sounds like you're calling my best customer a liar.
38019,Stefan," You're ripping me off, Dean."
38020,Dean," What you gonna do about it, kid? Huh? You gonna quit? Run off to wherever the hell you came from?"
38021,Dean, That's what I thought.
38022,Stefan, Hello?
38023,Alaric," Hey, just checking in... (cut to Alaric sitting in a diner) ...to see if your contact panned out yet."
38024,Stefan, (sees a young woman standing outside the garage) Still working on it.
38025,Alaric, Good. Keep me posted. Let me know how it goes.
38026,Alaric, (surprised) You already read all that?
38027,Caroline," Cover to cover, with no mention on how to undo an anti-magic force-field. And if I'm going to single-handedly take back our town, I'm gonna need a little bit more to go on."
38028,Alaric," Got it. All right, well. (he draws a book) I brought ""Ancient Witchcraft, volume two""."
38029,Caroline, I read it.
38030,Alaric," How about ""The Art of Hexing"" and ""Elements of Magic""?"
38031,Caroline, Fine. Thank you. So... how's Stefan?
38032,Alaric, He's ok.
38033,Caroline, How often do you talk to him?
38034,Alaric, I don't know. Couple times a week.
38035,Caroline," Oh, huh."
38036,Alaric," I'm gonna go out on a limb here, Caroline. Is something bothering you?"
38037,Caroline," He didn't say goodbye. Damon and Bonnie died and he just left. No phone calls, no e-mails. Just disappeared into thin air. And I haven't heard from him in months. I actually convinced myself he was in some remote mountain region and couldn't accept my calls."
38038,Alaric, Or maybe he just doesn't want to bother you with every half-lead that goes nowhere.
38039,Caroline, Or maybe I just need to get over it. Thanks for the books.
38040,Elena, (on phone) Why isn't Jeremy answering his phone?
38041,Matt, (goes downstairs) I don't know. He's probably doing homework or something.
38042,Elena," Doing homework? Put me on speaker, please. (Matt puts her on speaker and lies his phone on the table next to Jeremy's foot) Jeremy, I know you can hear me. Get your butt off that couch and do something productive."
38043,Jeremy, Or what? You're gonna come here and make me?
38044,Elena," Or I'll have the sheriff arrest you and drag you to the town border, where I will kick your ass myself. Matt, a little help, please."
38045,Matt," Yeah, I'll deal with him."
38046,Elena, Thank you. (she hangs up)
38047,Matt," (sighs) So, this is it, huh? Video games. Random girls. Drunk by noon every day. Look, it sucks that Bonnie's dead, Jer. I get it, but you need to start living your life again."
38048,Jeremy, How? By joining the community protection squad? What exactly are you protecting us from? Bike theft? Litter? Magic doesn't work here. The town's safe.
38049,Matt," (visibly annoyed) For now. But Caroline's working on a way to reverse all that. So, it's only a matter of time before we're dealing with all the problems that come along with vampires again. You're a hunter. You have k*ll. Use them."
38050,Jeremy, No more magic means I'm not a hunter anymore. (opens can)
38051,Matt," Yeah, you're right, Jer. You're not much of anything anymore."
38052,Luke, Hey.
38053,Elena, Hey. You're home. I thought you were coming over at 5.
38054,Luke," I know you did. (looks down) Look, Elena, I can't help you anymore."
38055,Elena, Is it because I told you that I was thirsty? It's fine. I can get more at the bl*od bank at the clinic. I work there. It's easy.
38056,Luke," Elena, you're going through this stuff like crazy."
38057,Elena, Yeah.
38058,Luke, I'm not a drug pusher.
38059,Elena," No, you're my friend. (goes inside the dorm room and starts searching for herbs in Luke's drawers) My frind in spite of the fact that my boyfriend got stuck on the Other Side..."
38060,Luke," Elena, don't."
38061,Elena, Because you decided to stop the spell that could bring him back. My friend that owes me.
38062,Luke, No. A friend who cares about you and thinks you're living in denial.
38063,Elena, I know you have more.
38064,Luke," (angrily) Elena, stop."
38065,Elena," (catches Luke's clothes, shakes him and pushes into a wall) Where is it?"
38066,Luke, Look at you.
38067,Elena," Where is it? I need to see Damon, Luke, and I'm not asking."
38068,Elena," I kind of want to set up Ric (music playing) with Jo from the hospital. I mean, we both know he has a soft spot for the sexy doctors type. (Damon shakes his head) How long do you think it takes after somebody comes back to life before they can start dating again?"
38069,Damon," Well, the fact that you can say that with a straight face is one more reason that I love you. (smiles)"
38070,Elena," So, like, 3 months?"
38071,Damon," Can I ask why there is not a Bennett witch in the back? I mean, can't Luke whip up a batch of herbs in Bonnie flavor?"
38072,Elena," You know, if I had to drive around with everyone that I've lost, I'd need a school bus. (smiles)"
38073,Damon, Or you just know that Bonnie would agree with Luke. The last thing you need to do is conjure up someone who's gonna tell you the truth.
38074,Elena, Can we not talk about it?
38075,Damon, About what? The fact that I'm dead? Because I am.
38076,Elena," Technically, you were dead when we met."
38077,Damon, Good point. Now I'm just gone.
38078,Elena," Damon, please, don't say that."
38079,Damon," And this conversation is pretty much the smart, level-headed you talking to the irrational possible drug addict you. (scoffs) Which is clear evidence of your insanity."
38080,Elena, Yeah. Ok. (turns up music)
38081,Tyler," Oh. Watch it, dick! (he sees it's Alaric and startles) Whoa, sorry. Still working out the kinks of being human. My tolerance blows. (he drinks beer)"
38082,Alaric," Yeah, Tyler, not to play chaperone here, but are you sure somebody with your anger issues should be drinking at all this close to a full moon?"
38083,Tyler, My issues are under control. Coach lets me practice with the football team. I get to kick ass in a controlled environment.
38084,Alaric, Till you get plastered and do something stupid and trigger your werewolf curse all over again.
38085,Tyler," Alaric, chill. It's under control."
38086,Alaric, Good. (takes the beer from Tyler) But just in case.
38087,Tyler, Really?
38088,Alaric," You know, I haven't been buzzed since I came back to life. And saying that aloud while sober really freaks me out. Ahem. (chuckles and sees that Tyler is staring at Liv) As the only sober person here, trust me when I tell you this, Tyler... The girl is not so into you. Thanks for the beer. (he leaves)"
38089,Ivy, Your fridge makes me want to k*ll myself. We're gonna have to split this.
38090,Stefan, Knock yourself out.
38091,Ivy, So. You want to grab dinner? There's that crab shack on the harbor you want to check out.
38092,Stefan," Uh, yeah, I would, but, um, I told Dean I'd stop by the garage later."
38093,Ivy," Yeah, never heard that one before."
38094,Stefan," Hey, look, no offense, Ivy, but, uh, you're the one who showed up to me today."
38095,Ivy," Hey, I'm not asking for your hand in marriage. Stefan, come on. We've been hanging out for two months now. I don't know anything about you or your family. Your friends you never talk about call you and you get all weird."
38096,Stefan, I get weird?
38097,Ivy," Yeah. You get weird. So, we'll play a game. You tell me one thing about you and I'll tell you one thing about me."
38098,Stefan," Well, I already know everything about you. You're from Colorado. You love dogs. Your dad's a bit of a pain in the ass, but you graciously let him pay your rent."
38099,Ivy, [laughs] Okay. Fine. Your turn. Now tell me something I don't know about you.
38100,Stefan, I'm a vampire.
38101,Ivy, You're so annoying.
38102,Stefan, Hey. And I like you.
38103,Jo, Thank god. Someone over 20. The rest of the chaperones are huddled around the burger bar.
38104,Alaric, And you're a vegetarian.
38105,Jo, I don't eat red meat. I look at bl*od all day. (b*at) Because I work at the medical center. Not because I'm a serial k*ll or anything. I'm Jo.
38106,Alaric, Alaric. I teach Occult Studies here.
38107,Jo, I didn't know that was an actual thing.
38108,Alaric, Yeah.
38109,Jo, Not that it's not a thing. (points to his flask) May I?
38110,Alaric," Uh, you know, actually, I'm a germaphobe."
38111,Jo," A germaphobe. So, you're like the vegetarian of cool people."
38112,Alaric, Ha ha! Yeah. Exactly. Um... Will you excuse me a second? I actually have to make a— A quick phone call.
38113,Alaric," Ok, so, when I lost my human nature, I also lost my game. Where are you?"
38114,Damon, What are you looking for?
38115,Elena, I thought I had— guess not. What's this?
38116,Elena, Hey. Are you okay?
38117,Sarah, Depends. Am I still in the western hemisphere?
38118,Elena, Hang on. I can help.
38119,Sarah, I'm sorry. I'm from New York and we're big on cell phone reception.
38120,Elena, Where you heading?
38121,Sarah, Mystic Falls. My GPS died and then I started second-guessing myself—aah! Aah!
38122,Damon, Easy. This is when you wipe her slate and let her go.
38123,Elena, I'm still hungry.
38124,Damon," You're gonna k*ll her, just like you nearly k*ll the last one and the one before that and the one before that."
38125,Elena," I got it, Damon. I'm gonna let her go. I'm just— I just need a little more."
38126,Caroline," Oh, my god! What are you--"
38127,Elena, Caroline. It's not--
38128,Elena, No!
38129,Sarah," Help! Help me, please."
38130,Caroline, What did you do? Why the hell are you feeding on people?
38131,Elena, It's fine. I've compelled everyone else.
38132,Caroline," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. So you're the border-lurker?"
38133,Elena, The what?
38134,Caroline," Yeah, did you know my mom's been out looking for a vampire prowler?"
38135,Elena, The herbs... Luke's been giving me. They make me so thirsty. (turns away from Caroline) I am not thinking straight.
38136,Caroline," Whoa, what herbs?"
38137,Elena," They make me see Damon. (turns to Caroline) I can talk to him, and, and I can be with him, and -"
38138,Caroline," God, is this what you've been doing this whole time? Hallucinating your dead boyfriend?"
38139,Elena," I tried to grieve him, Caroline. Trust me, I know grief. I've got grieving down to a science at this point, and I tried. But every time I let it sink in that I'm never gonna see him again, I feel like I'm gonna die."
38140,Caroline," Oh God, I get it okay? I do. But, there are better ways to get through this."
38141,Elena," Like what? Like dropping out of school and having picnics with my mom, near the town border? Or maybe I could pull a Stefan and bounce from country to country, chasing some false hope that we're gonna find a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back. We're all getting through it. This is me, getting through it, okay?"
38142,Caroline," Yeah but you're not getting through it, Elena. You're just pressing pause. (sighs) Look, I'll call my mom and she can fix all this. But you need to get out of here, go hide, okay? So just... go."
38143,Elena, What am I doing?
38144,Sarah," Help me. (Collapses; Matt jogs over) Please, help me."
38145,Matt, Are you okay? It's OK.
38146,Sarah, You have to help me. There was this girl I saw and she -
38147,Matt," You're OK, calm down."
38148,Sarah, I swear to God she had these teeth and she bit me. You have to help me.
38149,Tripp, What the hell's going on here?
38150,Sarah," You know, I saw this girl. You need to find her."
38151,Tripp, What happened?
38152,Sarah, There was this girl and I was... I was lost...
38153,Matt, She had a dog. It bit her. She was lost. She stopped to ask this girl for directions. She had a dog and it bit her.
38154,Tripp, Is that what happened? Look at me.
38155,Sheriff Forbes, Matt. What's going on here?
38156,Tripp, This girl was attacked. I'm not sure we're getting the full story.
38157,Sheriff Forbes," Matt, get her to the hospital now."
38158,Sarah, (weakly) No... You're not listening.
38159,Sheriff Forbes, Hey-hey-hey-hey.
38160,Tripp, What are you doing? You need to talk to her.
38161,Sheriff Forbes, We'll get a statement as soon as she's been treated.
38162,Tripp, You didn't even ask her what happened.
38163,Sheriff Forbes," All due respect, Tripp, you run a volunteer community program. I'm the sheriff. Let me do my job. (to Matt) Go!"
38164,Stefan, Hello?
38165,Elena," Stefan, is that you? I know it's been a really long time since we talked, but..."
38166,Stefan," Elena, hey. What's going on?"
38167,Elena, I need you to tell me that you found something. A witch. A guy who knows a witch who knows something. Anything. I need you to give me hope and tell me that you're gonna find Damon and bring him back.
38168,Stefan, Not yet.
38169,Elena," But how do you do it? How do you wake up in the morning? (she starts crying) How do you go about your day without falling apart? Tell me what you're doing to get through this, because I'm clearly doing it wrong."
38170,Stefan," There's no right or wrong way, Elena."
38171,Elena," No, there's only forever. That's why I need you to give me hope. Because I don't think I can live forever without him."
38172,Stefan, I can't. I gave up.
38173,Elena, (surprised) You just said that you were looking for him.
38174,Stefan," I did. And then I realized it was pointless and that I needed to move on with my life, so... I stopped."
38175,Elena, (angrily) What do you mean you stopped?
38176,Stefan," I mean I said good-bye, Elena. I moved on. Damon is gone. It's time for you to say good-bye, too."
38177,Tyler," Where are you? The game's gonna start in, like, 15 minutes."
38178,Caroline," Do you know Elena has some witchy drug problem? Yeah, Luke Parker has been feeding her some concoction that allows her to hallucinate Damon."
38179,Tyler," Whoa. Slow down, what?"
38180,Caroline, It gets her all bloodlusty and confused. She nearly k*ll a girl today.
38181,Tyler, This makes no sense.
38182,Caroline," Yeah, well, neither did the fact that she got over Damon so quickly when he died. Now it's crystal clear. She hasn't. She's living in a fantasy land."
38183,Tyler, (worried) Is she ok?
38184,Caroline," She's a mess. And as long as Luke keeps playing witch doctor, she's not going to get any better."
38185,Tyler, Let me deal with him.
38186,Matt, We're just meeting up with my friend here. Everything will be fine.
38187,Matt," (He's trying to catch Sarah) Sarah, stop, please. Get back in the car. Stop, Sarah! (He catches her) Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you."
38188,Sarah, (angrily) You kidnapped me.
38189,Matt," Look, I know you're scared, and I'm sorry that this happened to you, but all I can do is promise that it won't happen again."
38190,Sarah, Why the hell should I trust you?
38191,Matt," Because I've been attacked like that more times than I can count. I've had my throat ripped open. I've had my neck snapped, my hand smashed. I've drowned. I've died and come back to life. And I've lost what little family I had, and I refuse to lose anyone else. I want to protect people like you. Like us."
38192,Sarah," That's... quite a story, but... Thing is, I don't trust anyone. Ever."
38193,Caroline, That's probably wise.
38194,Luke, Hey. Have you seen Elena?
38195,Tyler," She's not coming. (he drinks a sip) Apparently, she's not in her right mind."
38196,Luke, What happened?
38197,Tyler, Is this what you've been up to all summer? Messing with Elena's brain? Does it help with the guilt or are you just desperate for friends?
38198,Luke, Where's Elena now?
38199,Tyler, Why? So you can trick her into thinking Damon's alive? Who does that? She almost k*ll someone.
38200,Luke, You're drunk. Don't touch me.
38201,Tyler," Where's your magic now, Parker? What's wrong? You can't chant? You stay away from Elena, or you're gonna have a problem your magic wand can't fix."
38202,Alaric, Hey! Knock if off. Knock it off.
38203,Alaric," You got it under control, huh? Huh?"
38204,Alaric, (to Luke) You want to tell me what that was about? Come on. Let's get out of here.
38205,Elena, You can't be here. You're not even real. It's just my subconscious making me see what I want to see.
38206,Damon, One call from my brother and you're gonna throw all this away?
38207,Elena," You know I want to see you, Damon. But it makes me reckless. I hurt people."
38208,Damon," So, why am I here? Do you want to move on? Move on."
38209,Elena, I never got to say thank you.
38210,Damon, For what?
38211,Elena, For saving Stefan and... For bringing back Alaric and Tyler. Thank you.
38212,Damon, Elena...
38213,Elena," No, I'm not done yet. I... I want to thank you for giving me everything I always wanted. A love that consumed me. And passion. Adventure. There's nothing more I could ever want other than for it to last forever, but... It can't. This is the last time I'm gonna see you. This is good-bye, Damon. I love you. I have to let go."
38214,Damon, You're still holding on.
38215,Elena," I... no. I... I said good-bye, Damon."
38216,Damon, I don't blame you. You know what's waiting for you. How long before you go running back to Luke?
38217,Elena," No. I told you. That was the last time, Damon. I... I'm done."
38218,Damon," An eternity of torment, agony, and grief. And you feel it all."
38219,Elena," Stop it, Damon. Stop it, stop it. You're getting in my head. Don't do this. Please."
38220,Damon, You'll feel it forever.
38221,Elena, No!
38222,Liv, Could you be more of a douche bag cliche?
38223,Tyler, I got a little out of control. I know.
38224,Liv, A little? It's not Luke's fault that your friend's emotionally blackmailing him to fulfill whatever mental head case crap she's going through.
38225,Tyler," Grief. It's called grief. Your brother got to live that day, remember? The rest of us lost people because of him."
38226,Liv," I'm aware of that, Tyler. I think about it every day. So does Luke. A lot of you got your lives back, too, because of me. So, at the very least, do me a favor and lay off my brother."
38227,Tyler, You're right. I'm sorry.
38228,Liv, Yeah. Our twin powers don't work like that. You actually have to tell Luke to his face.
38229,Tyler," Well, I will. Listen. Liv, 4 months ago, I could do anything. I could make anyone do anything that I wanted. I was stronger than most people on this earth. And then it went away. And all that's left inside of me is rage."
38230,Liv, Why are you telling me this?
38231,Tyler, Because I want you to understand that I am trying to deal with it.
38232,Liv," OK, good. Good luck dealing with it."
38233,Tyler, Why do you do that? I'm trying to talk to you and you just give me that look and walk away?
38234,Liv," What would you like me to do, Tyler?"
38235,Stefan (voice recording), It's Stefan. Leave a message.
38236,Caroline, Hey. It's me. Just leaving another message about how today was not a good day. Everyone drifted apart.
38237,Caroline, It's like everyone's pretending they can get through this alone.
38238,Caroline, Elena's gone and I think she's so scared to accept what happened that she's become a completely different person.
38239,Caroline," And if you ask me, Tyler's just hiding at Whitmore, pretending everything's fine as if he can outrun his werewolf gene or something."
38240,Caroline, And Matt and Jeremy never leave Mystic Falls anymore. There's an invisible wall standing between us and them and nobody's doing anything about it. Part of me wonders if they hope we never find a way back in.
38241,Caroline," And then there's me, just sitting in a diner on the border of town looking for a way to get our home back. We just lost two of our closest friends. We need each other. We need to be together, Stefan, or pretty soon we're just gonna end up pictures in a yearbook in a drawer somewhere, and so, that is why I am not going to stop calling you until you pick up the phone and I hear your voice and you tell me that you are going to help me fix it. Because I am not going to give up on us."
38242,Elena, Do you like being a vampire?
38243,Alaric, Why don't you get some sleep? We'll talk about it tomorrow when that crap's out of your system.
38244,Elena, Because with all the funerals and the start of the year... We never really talked about how you're dealing with all this.
38245,Alaric," You mean with me coming back to life? Well, moving away from Mystic Falls helped. And since my ex-girlfriend is happily married to a pediatrician up in Alaska, I didn't have any awkward reunions to handle."
38246,Elena, I meant the bl*od lust. The heightened emotions and immortality.
38247,Alaric," Honestly, Elena... I hate everything about being a vampire."
38248,Elena," Me, too. At least I did. Then one day, I discovered the good part. You know... The promise that love could be eternal. And I had that with Damon. Which means for the rest of eternity, I'm gonna have a hole in my heart where he's supposed to be."
38249,Alaric, Trust me. It gets easier.
38250,Elena," I know how death works, Ric. Trust me. I have done it. A lot. There's no such thing as moving on. It's a lie. So, if I'm ever going to be able to fall in love again, and make eternity bearable, I need you to do something."
38251,Alaric, What?
38252,Elena," You were created by the original vampire spell, which means you can compel other vampires. And since I can't take away my vampirism, I want you to take away Damon. I want you to compel me to forget that I ever loved him."
38253,Bonnie, Every day I tell you I hate that.
38254,Damon, And every day I do it anyway. Bon appetit.
38255,Bonnie," The other side is collapsing, and everyone in it is going away."
38256,Elena," The herbs, they make me so thirsty."
38257,Caroline," Stefan didn't say good-bye. Damon and Bonnie died, and he just left."
38258,Elena, I need you to tell me that you're gonna find Damon and bring him back because I don't think I can live forever without him.
38259,Stefan, I can't I gave up. I moved on.
38260,Damon, Huh. That got awkward fast.
38261,Bonnie, What happened? Where are we?
38262,Damon, Where are you going? Hey.
38263,Damon," Well, I feel a fang. I'm still a vampire. Either I'm a dead vampire or Mystic Falls is no longer magic free."
38264,Bonnie, Look.
38265,Damon, I definitely blew that up about an hour ago.
38266,Bonnie, Why don't we see any people? If we're still on the Other Side we should at least be able to see the living.
38267,Damon, Where the hell are we? And I don't mean geographically.
38268,Bonnie, I have no idea.
38269,Matt," Jer! Come on, we're going to be--"
38270,Sarah, Sorry I... I needed a place to crash. Jer said it was cool.
38271,Matt, This isn't Jer's house.
38272,Jeremy, Well it's not yours either.
38273,Sarah," Look it's no big deal, I can just take off."
38274,Matt," Yeah, why don't you do that."
38275,Sarah, Bye.
38276,Matt," Why would you bring her here? You shouldn't be anywhere near her, dumbass. Not after what happened yesterday."
38277,Jeremy, Caroline compelled her to forget Elena attacked her. It's not a big deal.
38278,Matt," Not a big deal? Right, I forgot. You don't care about anything."
38279,Stefan, Hey.
38280,Ivy, Hey.
38281,Stefan," Uh, what are you doing?"
38282,Ivy," Um, I'm... I mean I thought it would be nice to d... completely overstay my welcome."
38283,Ivy," I'm sorry, I thought I... never mind what I thought."
38284,Stefan," No, no. I just... I wasn't really expecting you to... still be here. That's all."
38285,Ivy, Right. Because why should you expect someone you spent the night with to make assumptions about breakfast. I'm gonna go.
38286,Stefan," No, no, Ivy. I was just--"
38287,Ivy," No, Stefan I get it. I am super into you, you're intermittently into me. Breakfast, bad."
38288,Stefan," Ivy, look why don't we... have dinner tonight. Although I should probably do the cooking."
38289,Elena (V.O.)," It's been four months, it's time for me to let go."
38290,Jeremy, You gonna erase Bonnie from your head too?
38291,Elena," Missing Bonnie, makes me sad, Jer. Missing Damon makes me dangerous. Alaric will compel away any memories and then make me forget that I had him do it. I need you to keep the truth from me too. Tyler and Stefan are on board."
38292,Matt, What about Caroline?
38293,Elena, Somehow I doubt she'll take much convincing.
38294,Caroline, You said that Stefan was looking for a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back.
38295,Alaric, I thought he was. I've been feeding him leads for months. He let me believe he was following them.
38296,Caroline," Well, I've been a little focused on magic bubble duty. And as you can see by the lack of magic in Mystic Falls, it's a spectacular fail of a mission. And now you're telling me that this whole time no one has been doing anything to help Bonnie and Damon?"
38297,Alaric, I wouldn't exactly say no one.
38298,Enzo," Oh, just lay it down."
38299,Witch, I don't know anything.
38300,Enzo, You witches are also monstrously secretive. Lucky for me I'm quite gifted at unraveling the truth.
38301,Witch," Okay, there's a coven in Oregon. They'd found a way to communicate with their ancestors before it went away. Maybe they know what happened to your friends. They call themselves the Gemini Coven. They're small and weird and they don't like outsiders."
38302,Enzo, See? You did know something.
38303,Witch, I just wanted you to work for it.
38304,Caroline, Ahem.
38305,Enzo," Ha ha, well, well well. Well, there's a blast from the past. Hello gorgeous."
38306,Elena, Talk me through it again?
38307,Alaric," I raided the psychology department's research library, and a nutshell would be using a combination of hypnotherapy and memory reprocessing techniques."
38308,Alaric," The more we talk, the more you'll relax and open your mind to me."
38309,Alaric," We're going to be searching through memories that are deeply embedded, and each significant memory that we hit which is connected to Damon I will help you modify. And this should eventually lead us to the signature memory which once erased will create a positive domino effect through all your other memories."
38310,Elena, Can't you just compel me to forget everything at once? Or we can go get a beer?
38311,Alaric," I am supernaturally rewiring three years of your memories. If it were that easy, I wouldn't be so terrifying."
38312,Alaric, I have some questions. Answer them honestly.
38313,Elena, I will answer everything honestly.
38314,Alaric, Do you have doubts about this?
38315,Elena, Yes. But I know I have to do this.
38316,Alaric, Are you afraid?
38317,Elena, More sad than afraid.
38318,Alaric, Why sad?
38319,Elena, Because I don't want to stop loving him.
38320,Alaric," Do you trust me, to be digging around in your mind?"
38321,Elena, I trust you completely.
38322,Alaric, Okay. Well then let's... let's get started... Who is Damon Salvatore?
38323,Elena," He was my boyfriend, I loved him and he died."
38324,Alaric, And when did you first meet him?
38325,Elena, I was in high school.
38326,Damon, Katherine.
38327,Elena," No, I'm Elena."
38328,Damon, I'm Damon.)
38329,Alaric, And what was he like?
38330,Elena," There was something different about him, dangerous. But not in a way that scared me. He was exciting."
38331,(Flashback to when they first met, 
38332,Elena (in the road), I don't know what I want.
38333,Damon," Well, that's not true. You want what everybody wants."
38334,Elena, What?)
38335,Alaric, And how did he make you feel?
38336,Elena, Like anything was possible.
38337,Alaric," You had a nice moment in the road with a stranger. But that's all he was, a stranger."
38338,Elena," Stranger, two people passing in the night."
38339,Alaric, Are you okay?
38340,Elena," Hmm, yeah let's just keep going."
38341,"IN MYSTIC FALLS, OTHERWORLDLY",  
38342,Damon (groans), How many more streets are we going to wander?
38343,Bonnie (looks annoyed), How many times are you going to ask me questions I don't have the answers to? Huh?
38344,Bonnie, There's something weird about these cars.
38345,Damon," Yeah, they're all 20 years old or more and yet they look brand new."
38346,Damon, And that is Elena's not-so-burnt-to-a-crisp house.
38347,Bonnie (looks at him confusedly), Hmm?
38348,Damon, Look.
38349,Bonnie, Rare solar eclipse expected to be seen across 12 states?
38350,Damon (rolls his eyes), The date.
38351,Bonnie," May 10th, 1994. Is that--? Are we--? But that's impossible."
38352,Damon," I don't think we should be asking where we are, I think we should be asking when we are."
38353,Alaric, Tell me about this moment.
38354,(Flashback to 3x10 when Damon kissed Elena on her porch, 
38355,Damon," No, you know what? If I'm going to feel guilty about something, I'm going to feel guilty about this."
38356,Elena (V.O.)," He kissed me. I mean, I shouldn't have let him. I knew that he was in love with me, and even though Stefan and I were on the outs, I shouldn't have let him."
38357,Alaric," He kissed you, you thought it was inappropriate. You told him so."
38358,Elena, I told him it was wrong.
38359,Alaric, Who is Damon Salvatore?
38360,Elena, He was my boyfriend.
38361,Elena," I loved him, and... he... he died."
38362,Alaric," You know, why don't we... why don't we take a little break, okay? To be honest, I could use a drink."
38363,Damon, Where is any booze in this empty retroville?
38364,Bonnie," It feels so weird to be back here, I practically grew up on this porch."
38365,(Damon stops the swing.) Damon," Alright, talk me through it."
38366,(Bonnie turns to him.) Bonnie," Before the Other Side collapsed, my Grams said that she made a sacrifice so that I could find peace."
38367,Damon, The part where you actually have a theory.
38368,Bonnie," Well, this clearly isn't peace, otherwise I wouldn't be stuck here with you."
38369,(Damon makes a face.) Damon, Rude.
38370,Bonnie," She must have... I don't know, sent me somewhere. And when I held your hand... it took you with me."
38371,Damon," Well, did she happen to whisper a safe word in her last breaths. A clue, maybe? Witchy path out of here?"
38372,Bonnie," No, but if we got here by magic, magic should be able to get us out."
38373,(Damon raises his eyebrows.) Damon, And that frown that's not upside down is telling me what?
38374,(Bonnie looks toward a glass cup.) Bonnie, Fes matos incendia
38375,Damon, Still can't do magic.
38376,Damon, Perfect.
38377,Elena, You're the last person I think would object to me erasing positive memories of Damon from my head.
38378,Caroline," Yeah, but we are literally chasing a lead. W-what if we find something out? Yeah, you know what if Damon returns home and everything returns back to normal? And you're just sitting there all confused and weird?"
38379,(Elena stands up.) Elena, Then Alaric will bring back my memories.
38380,Caroline, But--
38381,Elena," But what? Go ahead, Caroline say what you need to say. I don't want to... pressure you into agreeing."
38382,Caroline," I... don't know what to say, I was actually trying to think of what Bonnie would say."
38383,"(Elena sighs and walks to a tree, she begins to kick it softly with her shoe.) Elena", And?
38384,Caroline, And... she'd say that you should do what's best for you.
38385,Elena," Look, I think it's great that you still have hope, I really do but... for my own survival I need to let him go."
38386,Caroline," Well, then go on with your what-would-bonnie-bennett-do plan."
38387,Caroline, I'll make bumper stickers.
38388,Elena, I love you.
38389,Caroline, I love you too.
38390,Enzo," Girl bonding, very sweet. I heard you dropped out of school."
38391,Caroline, And I heard you were a lurker who was spying on my life. When do we exit?
38392,Enzo," Soon, uh. You should reconsider. Looks can only get a girl so far these days."
38393,Caroline," Yeah, well I'm not taking feminist tips from a guy who just used his tongue to get secrets out of a coat check girl."
38394,Enzo, Garment detendant.
38395,Caroline," You just made that up. So, did you also make up the 'Gemini Coven' lead too? Because I've never heard of them. Who are they?"
38396,Enzo," No idea, that's not where we're headed."
38397,Caroline," What?! Wu-Wait, where are we going?"
38398,Enzo, You'll see.
38399,Stefan, Hey.
38400,Ivy, Hey.
38401,Stefan," Perfect timing, I was just uh--"
38402,Ivy, I ran into some of your friends.
38403,(Stefan looks confused.) Stefan, What? Where?
38404,Enzo," Stefan! You are a hard man to track down. Uh, I wasn't sure if you're new..friend would invite us in but she said that this was your place. Which means... open invitation to all your mates, right? (Enzo rubs his hands together again.) Got any bourbon? (He walks out of the camera, leaving it on Caroline. She looks a bit angry with her arms folded, she exchanges a look with Stefan, who looks a bit guilty.)"
38405,Enzo," Good stuff, mate."
38406,Ivy," So, how do you guys know Stefan?"
38407,Caroline, He and I went to high school together. He used to date my best friend. (She cuts a glance at Stefan.)
38408,Caroline," Not that he's not allowed to date, I mean they broke up. I just didn't realize that he had met someone. So how did you meet exactly?"
38409,Stefan," Uh, Ivy's car was in the shop, where I work."
38410,Caroline, You work at an Auto-Repair shop?
38411,Stefan (smacks his lips), It's relaxing.
38412,Ivy (looks confused), Why? What did you used to do?
38413,Enzo," Ah, man of all seasons, jack of all trades. (He looks toward Ivy.) You have a lovely clavicle."
38414,Ivy," Oh, Thank you. I think."
38415,Enzo," Forgive me, I... always notice a woman's neck. I'm a neck person! So is Stefan, right Stefan?"
38416,Stefan, Not anymore.
38417,Enzo," Ah, well that's silly. You can't just stop being a neck person."
38418,(Ivy leans over to whisper at Caroline, Is Enzo your boyfriend?
38419,Caroline," Ugh, oh god no. Would you date that?"
38420,Enzo," Uh, hello. I'm right here, I have super-sensitive hearing. Practically supernatural. Do you believe in the supernatural, Ivy?"
38421,Ivy, I've... never really thought about it.
38422,Enzo," I myself, am I believer. Had to get a witch to do a locator's spell to find my buddy here."
38423,Bonnie, I didn't know you cooked.
38424,Damon, I don't. How'd you sleep? Me... not good. My 1994 mattress was very lumpy. Whatcha got there?
38425,Bonnie," Oh, Ms. Cuddles, I lost her when I was nine. But I went into my house last night and... here she was. (She lifts up the book she had been carrying.) I also found this at my Grams's house. Her old grimoire."
38426,Damon," Yeah, well I found this. Drank it last year when Ric died. (He removes the CD that was playing.)"
38427,Bonnie," So we're in this snapshot of another time, or... something."
38428,Bonnie," Everything that existed in 1994, still exists."
38429,Damon," For better, or for worse?"
38430,Bonnie," Listen, there was a time when I couldn't practice magic. This grimoire taught me alot, maybe... I can reteach myself."
38431,(Damon turns the radio back on.)," If you were still a witch. Which with our luck, and your k*ll... probably ain't the case."
38432,Bonnie, Would a little support k*ll you?
38433,Damon," You know, I am acutely aware that we are in some otherworldly time dimension. However, do you ever think for one second that maybe it's you being negative reacting to my natural self negative-ly?"
38434,"(Bonnie looks speechless, yet appalled)", You're ridiculous.
38435,Damon," Nope, I'm consistent. (Damon puts two pancakes onto a plate and sets it in front of Bonnie.) Eat your pancakes. Oh, and--(He grabs the newspaper from the counter and drops it in front of her.)--you can do a crossword puzzle."
38436,Bonnie," Oh, gee, thanks-- (She picks it up.) --breakfast with my least favorite person, and a crossword puzzle, from 1994. (She turns her back to him, opening the paper.) Alright, what's a seven letter word for--"
38437,Damon," You've got to be kidding me. Bonnie, look at the date on that paper."
38438,(Bonnie looks down and reads.)," It says, May 10th, 1994. It's the same day as yesterday."
38439,Bonnie, We're living the same day all over again.
38440,Damon," Well that proves it, we're in hell. Our own personal, custom-built hell. And you're in it with me. (Damon raises his bourbon.) Bottoms up. (He drinks.)"
38441,Matt," A little early for that, don't ya think?"
38442,Jeremy, It's dark out.
38443,Matt, I meant in life.
38444,Matt, Where's Sarah?
38445,"(Jeremy, his face turned from Matt, answers)"," Don't know, I'm not her keeper."
38446,(Matt plugs his earphones in his ear while turning and walking out.), I'm going for a jog.
38447,Sarah," You guys don't like each other very much, do you?"
38448,Jeremy, He's trying to give me purpose.
38449,Sarah, Why didn't you tell him I was still here?
38450,Jeremy, Didn't feel like it.
38451,Tripp," Hey, five miles with the group this morning wasn't enough for you?"
38452,Matt," Tripp, hey. I'm just blowing off some steam, what's up?"
38453,Tripp," That girl, from yesterday, the one with the animal bites. You know where she ended up?"
38454,Matt," Yeah, at my house. I'm not sure how that happened."
38455,Tripp, She there now?
38456,Matt," No, she split, why?"
38457,Tripp," I have some deputy buddies over at the station, one of them said that the sheriff ran the plates and the car came up stolen."
38458,Matt, You're kidding.
38459,Tripp," No, you know I can be paranoid but if there was a bad element coming through town. I want to keep tabs on it."
38460,Matt, Yeah.
38461,Tripp," So, let me know if she shows back up at your place?"
38462,Matt," Yeah, I will."
38463,Elena, It was the Miss Mystic Falls pageant. Stefan was supposed to be my escort but...
38464,Elena (V.O.), He bailed on me.
38465,Elena (V.O.), Damon stepped in. )
38466,(She's smiling as she stares out the window.)," He saved me from being embarrassed, in front of everyone."
38467,Elena (V.O.)," He took my arm, and led me out with the rest of the girls and all their dates and we danced. I remember that was the first time, I felt it."
38468,"Alaric (behind her, walks up)", Felt what?
38469,Elena (turns to him)," How sexy he was. I'd never let myself notice until then, I mean obviously I knew he was attractive but... I didn't want to see him that way."
38470,"(Alaric walks toward her, looking in her eyes, compelling her.)", You went down the stairs and no one was there.
38471,Elena, I was embarrassed but I got over it.
38472,Alaric, Who is Damon Salvatore?
38473,Elena," He was my boyfriend, I loved him and he died. (She puts her hands on her head in frustration.) Ric, I hate this. I mean, wha--? How much longer is it going to take?"
38474,Alaric, Until we find that signature moment. The moment you knew you loved him.
38475,Elena," Well, that's easy. It was after I found out about the sire bond. Everyone kept telling me that my feelings weren't real but I knew that they were."
38476,"(He stares into her eyes, compelling her.)"," Okay, your feelings were because of the sire bond, who is Damon Salvatore?"
38477,Elena, He was my boyfriend--
38478,Alaric," That's not it. You gotta dig deeper, earlier."
38479,Elena," I-I- I don't know, okay I... maybe it was when we spent the night at the motel together, I wasn't back together with Stefan yet and--"
38480,Elena, And all I could think about was kissing him.
38481,Elena, I wanted to kiss him so badly.
38482,"(Alaric looks in her eyes, compelling her.)"," No one kissed anyone, who is Damon Salvatore?"
38483,Elena, He was my boyfriend--
38484,Alaric," That's not it, next."
38485,Elena," I don't know, Ric!"
38486,Alaric," Well think about it, Elena! Think about that moment where you knew this person was somebody you had feelings for. That you loved, that you could see those feelings going on forever. Trust me, you never forget."
38487,Elena," Maybe we should just forget about this entire thing, it was a stupid idea, okay I-I can't do this anymore, alright? I'm done. I'm sorry."
38488,Bonnie, What's a seven letter word for k*ll me now?
38489,Damon, That joke got old six weeks ago.
38490,Bonnie," And so did this crossword puzzle. Everyday for two months I've done this stupid thing and I still can't figure out 27 across. Old tongue twister, Eddie turned top 40?"
38491,Bonnie, I hate pancakes!
38492,Damon," Whoa, don't take it out on the pancakes. Those pancakes, like myself, are waiting for you to be witchy to get us the hell out of here."
38493,Bonnie (stands abruptly), You know I've been trying!
38494,Damon," And failing. Further evidence, we're in hell. Not only am I stuck with you, I'm stuck with the useless version of you."
38495,(Bonnie is appalled slack-jawed and she opens her mouth to say something but closes it again.), Did you hear that?
38496,Damon (frustrated)," What would I have heard, Bonnie? We're the only two people here, we were the only two people here two months ago and the only two people here now!"
38497,Bonnie, Well I swear I heard something!
38498,Damon, Maybe it's the sound of existential despair. I hear that's what hell sounds like.
38499,Bonnie, You know what? You think we're trapped in your hell? I have to spend everyday on repeat with the person I like least on this earth--! Maybe we're trapped in mine.
38500,Enzo," So, Stefan, tell us, this house, very charming. When'd you get it?"
38501,(Stefan is pouring wine into a glass cup.), About a month or so ago.
38502,Ivy," No, more than that, remember? We met two months ago and you already had it."
38503,Caroline, You've... lived here for more than TWO months?
38504,Stefan," Yeah, I guess I have."
38505,Caroline," Well, I guess that's just weird because, you know; everyone thought you were living somewhere else."
38506,Caroline, And you're job was supposed to be investigative work not Auto-Repair.
38507,Stefan," Right. Well, I've moved on from that job."
38508,Caroline," Well, you can't move on from investigative work until you've solved the investigation, Stefan."
38509,Stefan," How 'bout we just drop it? I'm happy doing what I'm doing now, and that's all that should really matter, right?"
38510,Enzo," There, darling. No need to make a scene. Really it's all just some big misunderstanding, perhaps this will clear it all up."
38511,Ivy, OH MY GOD!
38512,Caroline, ENZO!
38513,Stefan (wincing from pain), What the hell is wrong with you?
38514,Enzo," So many secrets, what are you running from, Stefan?"
38515,Ivy," Um, I-I don't--"
38516,Caroline," Calm down, come with me. Let's go upstairs. (She turns to Enzo angrily.) No need to make a scene?!"
38517,Enzo, What kind of coward gives up on his own brother?
38518,Stefan, You don't know what you're talking about.
38519,Enzo, Why don't you enlighten me?
38520,Caroline," Hey, this is really not a good time."
38521,Alaric," I'm sorry, I-I've just really hit a wall with Elena. I just need some insight."
38522,Caroline," Okay, what's the wall?"
38523,Alaric, I'm trying to get her to figure out when she first fell in love with Damon but she... can't seem to get there.
38524,Caroline (V.O.)," (Alaric is sitting on Elena's dorm bed.) Yeah, because she doesn't want to admit what everyone already knows."
38525,Caroline," That she fell in love with Damon while she was still with Stefan. (The stairs creak behind her and she turns, it's Stefan. He looks at his feet.)"
38526,Stefan, You should probably get him out of here. He'll be up soon and I really don't feel like another go-around.
38527,Caroline (surrenders from silence), I'm sorry that you heard what I said.
38528,Stefan," It's fine, Caroline. I really don't care."
38529,Caroline," Why? Why don't you care? You're the one who always cared, it's what I liked about you. You know amidst all the crazy in our perfectly-messed-up lives, you cared more than anyone. So how could you just... stop?"
38530,Stefan," Cause I had to. I had to 'move on'. You know, the months before I moved here I was following every lead that Alaric sent my way. I spoke to every witch, every shaman, every psychic in 20 countries around the globe, and every lead was a dead end."
38531,Caroline," But Enzo has another lead, there's this coven in Oregon--"
38532,Stefan," The Gemini Coven, yeah I looked into them too, Caroline there was nothing there. Because there's nothing we can do, Damon and Bonnie are DEAD. I had to come to terms with that. And once I did, I had to start over, I couldn't just live my life with my old friends, I couldn't just go near Mystic Falls or Elena or--"
38533,Caroline," Or me? (They look at each other, Stefan looks away guiltily.) Cause I thought we were closer than that, I mean... you could hear in all those messages that I left you, you couldn't hear that I was completely falling apart without you? (She stares at him for his response but Stefan is still looking down, guiltily, her face straightens in realization, she looks away from his face.) Cause you never listened to them. "
38534,Stefan," I had to move on I didn't have a choice. (Caroline looks extremely sad, and appalled, her eyes are filling with tears.) I had to erase everything."
38535,"(Caroline sighs, looking more angry than sad now.)"," Well, let me summarize them for you. You're a dick, if you want him out of your house, you'll throw him out yourself."
38536,The receiver," ...is not available, please leave a message."
38537,Elena," Luke, where are you? I need more of that stuff like... now, I'm starting to go--(She pauses when Alaric is standing by the door, but then she continues to take the stuff from the box.): I don't want to hear it, Ric, okay? We tried, it didn't work. It's over."
38538,Alaric, It didn't work because you weren't being honest.
38539,Elena, I wasn't... are you crazy?
38540,Elena, I was being completely honest. Do you think I want to talk to you about my romantic life?
38541,Alaric, You weren't being honest with yourself.
38542,Alaric," Look, I want to hear all the Damon stuff... while you were still with Stefan."
38543,"(Elena looks up at him, incredulously.)"," No, I was completely faithful to Stefan."
38544,Alaric, Of course you were--
38545,Elena, I did everything--
38546,Alaric, I know--
38547,Elena," I stuck with him, even when he lost his humanity--"
38548,Alaric, I know you di--
38549,Elena," After he left a trail of bodies from Florida to Virginia, I fought for him."
38550,Alaric," I know you did, Elena, you don't want to admit it because you feel like you're betraying Stefan but this won't work until you do."
38551,Elena," No, I loved Stefan. The entire time, I never would have hurt him."
38552,Alaric," Elena, you've been lucky enough to love two people this deeply, in your young life. There's nothing wrong with that. It's okay."
38553,Elena (repeating Katherine from 2x22)," It's okay to love them both. (She turns to stare at Alaric.) That's what Katherine used to say. (There are tears in her eyes, as she slowly sits on the bed.) How sad is it that my own evil doppelganger was smarter than me?"
38554,"(Alaric grabs a chair and sits in front of her, a tear slips from her eye.) Alaric"," It's okay, Elena you can tell me, tell me the moment you knew you loved him."
38555,Elena (teary eyed and reassured), It was my birthday.
38556,Elena (V.O.), Damon and I spent the entire summer looking for Stefan.
38557,Elena (V.O.), And I was trying to put on a good face because Caroline was throwing this party for me but I was just so sad.
38558,Elena (V.O.)," I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't going to go, I wasn't going to leave the room."
38559,Elena (V.O.), Until Damon walked in to give me my... birthday gift.
38560,(Flashback," Elena turns when she sees Damon, and smiles.)"
38561,Elena," It was the necklace that Stefan had given me, I'd lost it."
38562,(Flashback, Damon approaches Elena with a small box and he opens it. It's Stefan's necklace.)
38563,Elena (V.O. flashback), And Damon knew what the necklace meant to me.
38564,Elena, My necklace.
38565,Elena, What it meant about my feelings for Stefan. Even though he loved me.
38566,(Flashback, Elena picks up her hair so Damon can put the necklace on.)
38567,Elena (V.O. flashback), He gave me the one thing that represented hope for me and his brother. I knew how much it hurt him. But he did it.
38568,(Flashback, Elena turns to Damon after he's finished.)
38569,"(Elena gropes at her neck, even though the necklace isn't there.)"," It was... the most selfless that he's ever been, and in that moment... I loved him. I didn't want to, I mean, I... It terrified me but, for that moment I loved him."
38570,Elena, Do it.
38571,(Elena grabs Alaric's hands desperately.)," It's okay, I'm ready."
38572,Alaric, I need you to be sure. Are you sure?
38573,Elena," I'm sure, just take it away, please. (Tears are streaming down her face.)"
38574,Alaric," Damon never came into the room, he never gave you the necklace. The party was miserable, but you spent the night at your house watching movies and eating popcorn with Jeremy."
38575,(Flashback," Damon snaps Jeremy's neck in 2x01, Elena falls down next her brother and looks up with hatred for Damon.)"
38576,Elena," Jeremy. (She said in realization.) Damon k*ll Jeremy, he snapped his neck right in front of me."
38577,Alaric," Elena, who is Damon Salvatore?"
38578,Elena (angry)," He's Stefan's brother, he's a monster. (She turns away with hatred.) Then he died."
38579,Caroline, Hey.
38580,(Elena is taking some clothes out.), Put on some party clothes and come to Whitmore. Tyler's coming over and we are going out.
38581,(Caroline laughs.), You sound good.
38582,Elena," I am good, I had a good day. I ditched all my classes and hung out with Ric, and we um... we talked about Bonnie."
38583,Elena," I had a good cry, and I don't know I... I really feel like things are taking a turn for the better. So get your ass down here and let's have some fun."
38584,Caroline," Well, how about I come in, sneak in the dorms and spend the night later, for old times' sake."
38585,Elena," Sounds perfect, love you."
38586,Caroline, Love you too.
38587,Enzo," Oh, well that was a bit of a bust. (He notices that she's sniffling and that she's not turned to him and his expressions turns into one of concern.) Hey, hey. (Enzo grabs her face and turns her to him, he sees her crying and he looks angry, he lets her go.) I'll be right back. (Enzo leaves Caroline sobbing in the car.)"
38588,Ivy," Hey, did your friends leave? (She notices the broken table.) Whoa, what happened?"
38589,Stefan," Oh, you know my friend he's a... a bad drunk."
38590,Ivy (smiling)," Yikes, well at least your friend Caroline seemed nice."
38591,Stefan (has the broken legs in his hand)," Yeah, well I'm going to go throw this out. (He heads into the backyard, and when he returns into the house Enzo has Ivy by her neck with both his hands.)"
38592,Stefan (slowly walking forward), Let her go.
38593,Enzo, Okay. (He snaps her neck and she falls to the ground.)
38594,Stefan," No! (Stefan superspeeds toward Enzo but Enzo throws him back onto the ground, and slowly approaches him.)"
38595,Enzo," I've got a girl out there crying over you, because she cares so much. (Stefan sits up but doesn't attack Enzo, his eyes are wide in shock.)"
38596,Enzo," I'm over here trying to figure out why, because I can't see what's worth caring about."
38597,Enzo," You know Damon once told me that he promised you an eternity of misery. And I remember thinking ""well what could his brother have ever done to inspire so much hatred?"" But now I get it... you're not a brother to him. Brother's don't give up. (He takes a step forward.) So every time I see you doing anything that looks like you've done so, every time you try to start over in a life that's nothing but a lie, I will make you pay."
38598,Enzo, I will be the one to bring you the misery you deserve.
38599,Enzo (breathless), See? We're all still neck-people.
38600,Voicemail," It's Bonnie, leave me a message."
38601,The phone beeps and Jeremy starts talking," Hey, it's me. I paid your cell bill again, your Mom said I could, I think she felt sorry for me or something. Maybe she just wants to hear the sound of your voice too, what do I know? I'm so pissed at you, Bonnie. Yeah, still. You... you told me that you were gonna die over the phone. So you kind of deserve me railing at you on voicemails that you're never gonna get. I guess I'll call and yell at you again, tomorrow."
38602,Jeremy, Ah! You scared the hell out of me.
38603,Matt," Shh, we've got a little problem. Sarah's shady, the plates on her car are stolen, she's gotta go."
38604,Jeremy, What are you? Deputy Dewey? How do you know that?
38605,(Sarah appears behind them.)," It doesn't matter how he knows it, he's right. I stole it from my old boss, he had wandering hands to I wandered my hands to his car keys."
38606,Matt," Look no offense, but you've gotta find someplace else to stay."
38607,Sarah," I totally get it, I appreciate you guys helping me, really I do. It's okay, I have family here. Sort of, I mean, I haven't met him but my Dad. He supposedly lives here. It's not like he's just going to let me sleep on the street, right?"
38608,Jeremy," Matt, at least let her stay until she finds her Dad."
38609,Matt," Seriously, Jer? I'm on the community protection committee and she's a car thief."
38610,Jeremy," Alright fine, we can go stay at Stefan and Damon's, no one's there."
38611,Matt," You can't leave, I told Elena that I'd watch out for you."
38612,Jeremy, It's not like she can do anything about it.
38613,Matt (on phone), So she says she has family here.
38614,Tripp," That's probably another lie but I'll look into it, thanks Matt."
38615,"(Matt, who was walking in front of the mansion,)"," Look Jeremy's a good kid, he's just going through some stuff."
38616,Tripp," I know all about him, I grew up with his Dad."
38617,Matt," Wait, you're from Mystic Falls?"
38618,Tripp," Born and raised, till my parents split. I think that's why I'm such a geek about this town. My family were such big supporters, we're the founding family actually."
38619,Matt, Which family?
38620,Tripp," The Fells, I'm Thomas Vincent Fell III, to be exact. My dad called me Tripp, and I was such a clumsy kid that I took my Mom's maiden name when he bailed. I mean, can you imagine? 'Tripp Fell?'."
38621,Matt," So if you're a founding family, that means you know all the stuff that go along with it, right?"
38622,Tripp," Oh, is there a secret handshake that never got taught? Look, I gotta go, I'll see you later for training though, yep?"
38623,Matt," Yeah, sure."
38624,Tripp, Any final words?
38625,Bonnie," I miss them too, you know."
38626,Damon, Look who got 27 across. (He sounds impressed.)
38627,Bonnie (smirks)," I wish, 27 across is a rock I am pushing up an endless mountain."
38628,Damon," It's an old tongue twister Eddie turned top 40, Eddie Vedder, pearl jam. Yellow Ledbetter."
38629,"(He sits the newspaper down. And Bonnie looks confused. Then she grabs the newspaper and looks at the puzzle, 27 across is filled in", 'YELLOW LEDBETTER'. A tune plays in the background of the scene.)
38630,Bonnie (looking up at Damon), Are you messing with me?
38631,Damon (taking it as a joke)," No, you messing with me?"
38632,Bonnie (talking about the crossword puzzle), I didn't finish this.
38633,Damon," Well, neither did I."
38634,Bonnie (still-faced), There's someone else here.
38635,Matt, You're from Mystic Falls?
38636,Damon, Where the hell are we?
38637,Bonnie, 1994.
38638,Dean (Boss)," Ain't a parking lot, kid."
38639,Stefan," Yeah, well I'm not here to work. Need a few days off."
38640,Dean, It looks like I need a new mechanic.
38641,Stefan," I said, I need a few days off."
38642,Dean," Are you slow? Let me simplify: Stay, keep the job. Leave, lose it."
38643,Dean, How the hell are you so strong!?
38644,Stefan," You hired a vampire, next time do a background check."
38645,Stefan," Now, shut up and don't move. (He sets his boss on the ground and Dean is still.) You have no idea how long I wanted to do that. See, I was trying to...get a fresh start, live a normal life, normal job, normal dick of a boss. That's you by the way, and this place was supposed to be my sanctuary. And it was until yesterday."
38646,(Stefan pulls Dean toward his car.)," Come with me. (He opens the trunk, revealing a dead Ivy.): This is my girlfriend Ivy, someone k*ll her last night in front of me. So, now I have to go back home, last place on this earth I wanna be. Find him, and k*ll him. (He shuts the trunk and turns to Dean.): Like I said, I need a few days off."
38647,Dean (slowly), You should take a few days off.
38648,Stefan," Thanks buddy, I will. (He grabs the keys from his back pocket.) Now, I need you to drive my car into the woods, and you're going to bury my girlfriend. And forget this ever happened. Oh, and when I get back you're giving me a raise."
38649,Elena," So I uh, volunteered at the hospital until like two. And then I figured we could carpool to the party at the swimming hole. (After setting the coffee down, Elena realizes Caroline is packing.) Um, normally when you move back in you unpack."
38650,Caroline, I'm not staying. Last night was just a momentary moment of weakness.
38651,Elena, Momentary moment?
38652,Elena, Are you sure you don't want to come back to school?
38653,Elena," Caroline, needing your friends isn't a weakness, momentary or otherwise."
38654,(Caroline shuts her suitcase.)," Tell that to Stefan, who clearly needs no one."
38655,(Elena crosses her arms)," Cut him some slack, he lost his brother. Granted, said brother was a homicidal maniac. But, still."
38656,Elena, What?
38657,Caroline," (shakes her head back into reality) Nothing, I just - I gotta go, I got breakfast with Enzo, so..."
38658,Elena, (looking judgmental) Enzo?
38659,Caroline (surprised alone)," Mm, hmm."
38660,Elena, You guys go on one road trip and all of a sudden you're breakfast buddies?
38661,Caroline," (giggles) Yeah, I guess so. Ironically, he's recently become one of the most stable people in my life."
38662,Elena," (looking skeptical & judgmental) Okay, then invite him to the party."
38663,"Caroline (sighing, frustrated)", Elena - 
38664,Elena," Come on, I got Matt to take the afternoon of from his training and Tyler to give the practice squad a break, even Jeremy is coming. It's been forever since we've all been together, it'll be fun."
38665,Elena, (pointing her finger at her) Don't make me invoke the nuclear option.
38666,Elena, Cause I will selfie b*mb you. Every five minutes.
38667,Caroline," (laughs) Okay, fine I'll go to the party."
38668,Elena, Yay. (She picks up the tray of coffees.)
38669,Caroline, But I'm not moving back in. (She heads to the door.)
38670,Elena, That is a conversation to be had over jello shots.
38671,Caroline (V.O. Matt), What did Alaric do to her?
38672,Matt, All I know is she doesn't remember what she saw in Damon and we're supposed to keep it that way.
38673,Caroline," (walking in a park with her coffee) I just spent the whole night with her, and it's weird. She just doesn't seem like her old self."
38674,Matt," (walking toward Tripp's car) Yeah, it's because she's happy isn't that the whole point?"
38675,Caroline," Yeah, I guess."
38676,Matt," Look, I gotta go. I'll see you later."
38677,Matt, It's a little early for a car wash.
38678,Tripp," Oh, yeah. I brought in some mulch so you guys could clean up that little park on 4th. Turns out red mulch stains. Who knew?"
38679,Matt," My friends are having a party, and I'd like to go by this afternoon after lunch."
38680,Tripp, You need a permission slip?
38681,Matt," Oh, I don't know."
38682,Tripp, I'm not your Mom. Go. (Jay jumps out from inside the car with a mop in his hand.) And take Jay. Suckered him into washing my car. He needs some fun.
38683,Jay," You're driving, I'm drinking."
38684,Tripp," (flashing a concerned, suspicious look) Both of you, keep your eyes open. We've had a lot of animal attacks lately."
38685,Jay, He means...dog -bite girl.
38686,Matt," Yeah, I know what he means."
38687,Sarah, That shower has four heads. Who's so dirty they need 4 heads?
38688,Jeremy," You'd be surprised. You want bourbon? (He looks back at the table, ready to give her a choice when he realizes it's just bourbon.) Or bourbon?"
38689,(Sarah hops up onto the place where the bourbon is.)," I hate bourbon, but I love this house. Can I just pretend that I found my dad and it's whoever lives here?"
38690,Jeremy," Trust me, it's not."
38691,Sarah," Why not? My mom lived in Mystic Falls for years before she had me, somebody had to knock her up."
38692,Jeremy, You ever think about asking her?
38693,Sarah," Oh, good idea. Hurry, let's go to the cemetery."
38694,Jeremy," Gotcha, sorry."
38695,Sarah, (looking around) Who does live here anyway?
38696,Jeremy," (looks deeply at the bourbon) Two brothers, one moved, the other...is dead. (He takes a swig of the bourbon from the bottle.)"
38697,Tyler," Hey, quick question."
38698,Liv," Quick answer, no."
38699,Tyler," Hilarious. We're having a party today, you think you could spare a keg or two from scull bar? You can come..."
38700,Liv, (smacks her lips) You and alcohol and my brother. Why does that combination sound so familiar and terrible? (She turns to her brother.) How is your trachea Luke?
38701,Luke," In fairness, he apologized."
38702,Tyler," I'm working on this, okay? I watch my drinking, I avoid things that make me angry."
38703,Liv," Come by the bar after 1, I'll see what I can do."
38704,Luke, You're doing that thing again.
38705,Liv, (looks up) What thing?
38706,Luke," Oh the thing where you're a bitch because you like somebody. It's pretty transparent, I don't blame you, he's hot. (Luke walks off, leaving Liv smiling.)"
38707,Elena, Hey cutebrag.
38708,Liam, Did you just call me 'cute brag'?
38709,Elena," Hey, I didn't come up with it. Another one of the volunteers did."
38710,Elena," What? Sometimes, you brag. At least it has cute in it."
38711,Liam," Small favors. I'm Liam, you're Elena. See how easy it is to remember?"
38712,Elena, Brag.
38713,Liam, Is there something you wanted other than to destroy my self -esteem?
38714,Elena," (smiles) Actually, yes. Are you doing anything this afternoon? My friends are throwing a party just outside my hometown, and there's a girl that I actually want you to meet."
38715,Elena, Just come.
38716,Liam, Okay.
38717,"Elena (surprised, caught off guard)", Stefan? Wha - hey! (She hugs him and then pulls away.)
38718,Elena," Wha - for the record, four months is far too long for me to go without seeing you."
38719,Stefan, I know. That's why I'm here. I wanted to stop by and say hi.
38720,Damon, I got it - (Damon said stubbornly.)
38721,Bonnie, (sighs) Okay. (She picks up a small piece of paper.) We need strawberries.
38722,Damon, Mmhmm.
38723,Bonnie," Eggs, milk and - ooh candles. (She picks up one and sets it in the cart, Damon looks at her for a second.)"
38724,Damon," I know it's been awhile, but you couldn't do magic as an anchor, so I'm curious what momentary lapse reason makes you think you can do it now?"
38725,Bonnie," You know, when all this started, you sucked at making pancakes but now they're somewhat edible.(She shrugs.) Milk."
38726,Bonnie, There's no reason to be Peter Pessimist. (She heads over to a rack of glasses and sets blue shades on her face with the tag dangling.) We have proof we're not alone.
38727,Damon," First of all. Don't nickname, that's my thing (He points to himself and strolls over to Bonnie with the cart, he snatches another pair of glasses from her) And this proof... (Damon sets the blue glasses on his face, so now they both are wearing it.) This mysteriously filled in crossword, could very easily have been you."
38728,Bonnie, (leans on the cart) I didn't. Fill. It. In.
38729,Damon, No. You don't know you filled it in. You also don't know that you talk in your sleep. Eggs.
38730,Bonnie, (opens the fridge beside them and grabs the eggs) What are you saying? Are you saying I sleep crossword?
38731,Damon," (takes the glasses off) I'm saying it makes more sense than the alternative. (He snatches the eggs and slams them in the cart, Bonnie takes off her glasses. )"
38732,Bonnie, I get what you're doing.
38733,Damon, What am I doing?
38734,Bonnie, You refuse to have hope that you'll see Elena again so you don't have to be disappointed.
38735,Damon (loudly), I refuse to have hope because there's nothing to hope for.
38736,Bonnie," (stops suddenly, pausing) Pork rinds."
38737,(Damon digs into the car and looks at the shopping index.), 
38738,Damon, Not on the list and eww.
38739,Bonnie," No, day -mon -a, (she emphasizes his name.): There were pork rinds on this shelf, There have been pork rinds here on every shopping trip we've had for the past 4 months."
38740,Bonnie, You hear that?
38741,Bonnie (satisfactory)," Hmm, you hear that, Damon? (She sounds like she's proved her point and Damon still looks bewildered.): That's what hope sounds like."
38742,Stefan, This hospital thing..Its a whole new look huh??
38743,Elena, Yeahh..Apparantly this color( pointing to her t -shirt) disguises all bodily fluids that i get covered in throughout the day. So far its been only observation but i don't know..i love it there. Seeing sick people getting better..it's inspiring.
38744,Stefan, You seem different. Seem happier.
38745,Elena, And you? Are you happy?(Pauses) Caroline told me a little bit.
38746,Stefan, Ohh..About the dinner party from Hell.
38747,Elena, (laughing) Her exact words actually. In between the ranting she may have mentioned something about your new job and a new girlfriend (questioningly) Ivy right?? Is it Ivy? (Stefan looks down uncomfortably) Stefan it's fine.Seriously. It's not weird i promise. I'm just happy to finally see you again you know. ( Stefan nods understanding) It's been really rough. Losing Bonnie the last couple of months. ( She stops suddenly realising something) Which is an incredibly insensitive thing to say to somebody who just lost their brother.I'm..I'm sorry.
38748,Stefan," No i've been working on the healing thing too. I guess. Hey, by the way, have you heard from Caroline? She's not returning any of my calls and i..i really wanna apologize for the way i acted."
38749,Elena, Ohh she'll be there at the swimming hole today. You should come.
38750,Stefan, No..no I'm not sure i'm ready to dive back into all that. No pun intended. (Elena smiles)
38751,Elena, Stefan they're your friends too. C'mon. I know that we can't hang out at the Grill anymore. But that does'nt mean we can't all spend time together. C'mon please. If not for that then atleast to convince Caroline that Enzo is not new best friend replacement material.
38752,Stefan, Will Enzo be there?
38753,Elena, Yeah..but i can easily uninvite him. I'd rather you come. (Stefan cuts in)
38754,Stefan, No.No. Don't worry about it. (Thinks for a moment) Yeah. Maybe i'll stop by.
38755,Elena, Great.
38756,Caroline, Do you understand the rules?
38757,Enzo," Yea Rule 1, don't mention Elena was madly in love with Damon or you'll k*ll me."
38758,Caroline, (Nodding) Mmhmm.
38759,Enzo," Rule 2, don't really reference Damon at all or you'll k*ll me."
38760,Caroline, Yup.
38761,Enzo," Rule 3, wear sunscreen and ( Caroline cuts in)"
38762,Caroline," Don't make fun of me. ( Enzo smiles a bit) It's important that we let Elena live her new, happy, problem ignoring, zombie life the way she wants."
38763,Enzo, A sentence that sounded oddly supportive and judgemental.
38764,Caroline, I support her. She did what she needed to do to stop chomping on innocent people on the road. It doesn't mean that i'm enjoying marinating all alone in my misery.
38765,Enzo, Well i'll marinate with you.
38766,Caroline, I appreciate it. Really i do.
38767,Enzo, But i'm not Stefan.
38768,Caroline," Rule no.4, Don't ever mention that jerk's name again or ( Enzo cuts in)"
38769,Enzo, Or you'll k*ll me. Got it.
38770,Caroline, Whoa..is that bl*od or pie? Please say pie.
38771,Enzo, Hmmm..(Dabs his finger with it and tasts it) That would be..Shirley..A special off the menu item. This little diner is surprisingly well stocked.
38772,Caroline," Tell me that you snatched, ate, erased."
38773,Enzo," Funny thing about that.You do the first two properly, the third isn't necessary."
38774,Caroline, You k*ll her?
38775,Enzo," Oh, don't act all shocked."
38776,Caroline," Well, I'm sorry, but death shocks me, and it also leads to a missing persons report, which leads to"
38777,Enzo, Sheriff's investigation? I'm terrified. I already have three warnings. One more is a fine.
38778,Damon," It's gotta be a short, faulty wiring, something."
38779,Bonnie, Or someone put a quarter in it and turned it on.
38780,Damon," You know i'm a little confused with all this misplaced hope. All right, Let's just say there's some one here. How do you know we're gonna get out?"
38781,Bonnie," Well, you say that this is your hell right? If there's someone else here, that means it's not your hell, and if it's not your hell that means Grams put us here, and if Grams put us here there's a way out."
38782,Damon, That's a hell of a logic knot you've tied for yourself.
38783,Bonnie," Thank you. So now that we have properly placed our hope, let's play a game. When we get out, what's the first thing you're gonna tell Elena?"
38784,Damon," (Thinks for a moment) Sorry i k*ll Bonnie. But she was the most annoying person in the world. (He starts walking towards the car park) She wouldn't shut up. She just kept talking.I mean, it's a wonder I made it as long as I did, but here's the thing, I think it's better this way because she didn't have magic, and she was pretty much useless."
38785,Bonnie, Damon.
38786,Damon, What??
38787,Bonnie," I don't know, you still think i'm useless? (She points to the parking lot and the screen pans to show Damon's car in the parking lot)"
38788,Damon, (Looks at the car and the number plate) That's my car. That's my car.
38789,Elena," She's determined but sweet, eternal optimist, never forgets a birthday. What else?"
38790,Stefan, Never gives up on her friends.
38791,Elena, Yes. True. She's completely loyal.
38792,Liam, This is good. Build her up. I'm sure she'll live up to these ridiculously high expectations.
38793,Elena, That's another one. Great at surpassing expectations.
38794,Liam, So she's perfect.
38795,Elena, Totally.
38796,Stefan, Pretty much.
38797,Liam, So how long have you two been together?
38798,Elena," Us? No. I'm... we're... heh. We're not, but, I mean, we did at one point..."
38799,Stefan, Not anymore.
38800,Liam, Was that recent? Because you two seem weirdly functional.
38801,Elena, Has it already been two years?
38802,Stefan, Time flies.
38803,Damon," ( Pretending like he's driving the car) Vrrrmm, vrrrmm!"
38804,Bonnie, How much longer are we gonna listen...
38805,Damon," Shh, shh, shh, shh. This sound is the opposite sound of your voice, and I so enjoy it."
38806,Bonnie," How did it even get here, Damon? Did you leave it here in 1994?"
38807,Damon," I don't know, Bonnie. It was 18 years ago. Had a lot going on that day."
38808,Bonnie, Ok. So you admit that it's pretty unlikely that you did.
38809,Damon, Very unlikely.
38810,Bonnie, ( Probing Damon to admit she's right) Which would stand to reason.. that...
38811,Damon," Someone may have put it here, Bonnie. Yes, i admit that."
38812,Elena, Damon
38813,Damon, I know. (Elena puts her hand over Damon's)
38814,Damon, I'm gonna tell Elena how much I love her. (Bonnie smiles) And then I'm gonna apologize for k*ll you.
38815,Bonnie, (Notices something behind) Wait. Did you just see that?
38816,Damon, I did that time. Let's go meet our little friend.
38817,Liam," So is a lake different from a swimmin' hole, or..."
38818,Elena, Swimming hole. Thanks for making me sound like a redneck. Why? Where did you party in High School?
38819,Liam," Oh. Somebody's house or second house, whichever had the biggest pool. Huh. I guess I do brag."
38820,Elena, Yup. Now it's my turn to brag because I bet nobody at your pool parties could do this.
38821,Elena," (While swimming she notices Jeremy kissing Sarah in the lake) Ahem. Um, ahem. Jeremy?"
38822,Sarah," Oh, my God."
38823,Jeremy, Elena.
38824,Elena," Sorry to interrupt what I'm sure was a heartfelt display of true love, but I'm Jeremy's sister, and we were about to have a nice little family chat."
38825,Sarah, That's why I'm an happy orphan. ( Sarah leaves from there)
38826,Elena, You invited the girl that I attacked?
38827,Jeremy, No. I brought the girl Caroline compelled to forget you attacked. She doesn't know anything.
38828,Elena," Jer, why would you even risk it?"
38829,Jeremy, Because she looks good in a bikini. Can I go now?
38830,Matt," Yeah. I may be driving, but if you puke in my truck, I'm gonna k*ll you."
38831,Jay," You know, dog bite girl's kind of hot. In, like, a trashy way, though."
38832,Matt, Why do you keep calling her that... dog bite girl?
38833,Jay, Because it's ridiculous. What kind of dog bites you in the neck.
38834,Tyler," I don't know, man I've seen some pretty vicious dogs."
38835,Matt," What's up, Ty?"
38836,Tyler, I just got a text from Elena. She wants to see us.
38837,Jay, Hold on. Are you telling me that you think a girl with two puncture wounds in her neck got bit by a dog?
38838,Tyler, I think if that's what she said then that's what happened.
38839,Jay, Then you're an idiot.
38840,Tyler, And you're a wasted douchebag. We all have faults.
38841,Jay, You want to say that a little louder?
38842,Matt," Jay, back off."
38843,Jay," No, no, no. I think you just called me a douchebag. I just want to make sure. ( Jay pushes Tyler and Matt comes in between)"
38844,Matt," Whoa, Jay! Jay, what you're doing right now, definition of a douchebag."
38845,Jay, (Calms down and smiles) Heh. Simmer. I'm just playing. You guys want beers?
38846,Matt, Yeah. (Turns around to face Tyler) Sorry.
38847,Stefan, Hey. It's Stefan. Leave a message.
38848,Caroline, Yeah. Not answering is one of his new things.
38849,Elena, He said he was here to apologize.
38850,Caroline, Lying. Also one of his new things. Stefan has a lot of new things.
38851,Elena, Hey. Have you guys seen Stefan?
38852,Matt, I didn't even know he was back.
38853,Tyler, So you want to fill us in on what we're doing here?
38854,Elena," You don't remember this place? We used to sneak off here and get wasted while our parents were outside grilling. Granted, we all have a few less parents, but we can still have fun. ( She offers them Jello shots)"
38855,Tyler," Actually, I can't. I'm working on my rage issues, and this wouldn't help."
38856,Matt," My buddy's wasted, and I've got to train in the morning, so..."
38857,Elena," Ok. Well, I don't want to sound like an alcoholic, but I do want a sh*t, so will someone do one with me?"
38858,Elena, Bottoms up.
38859,Caroline," Mmm! Well... Here we are, having fun. I'm having fun. Aren't we having fun? This is really fun."
38860,Elena," (Realising that Caroline is being sarcastic)Ok. Clearly, this was a big mistake. I just wanted to spend one afternoon where we pretend for just one second like we're not all drifting apart. ( She goes and sits besides Caroline)"
38861,Caroline," Well, that's the problem, Elena. Not all of us are ok with pretending. Some of us prefer to face our problems head -on."
38862,Tyler, I think we should go.
38863,Matt, Yeah.
38864,Elena, What's going on?
38865,Caroline," I'm just lonely, ok? And Bonnie's gone, Stefan's gone. Enzo... shocker...Terrible, m*rder friend."
38866,Elena," I'm still here, Car."
38867,Caroline, Yeah. You're still here. (She gets up to leave)
38868,Elena, Here take another sh*t and...(She realizes Caroline has already walked away)
38869,Elena, Ok. Not so much. 
38870,Bonnie, It was behind the pickup.
38871,Damon, No. It was in the front.
38872,Bonnie," Are you sure?
Damon: Yes. Absolutely I'm sure. It was right there."
38873,Damon, It was a tarp. We saw a tarp.( Suddenly the horse carousel turns on and music starts playing) And that... that is on a timer. That turned on by itself.
38874,Bonnie, But your car.
38875,Damon, I left it here in '94.
38876,Bonnie, And the crossword?
38877,Damon," You filled it out, Bonnie. Which means we're alone in my own hell with no Grams escape hatch. We're never getting out."
38878,Bonnie, (Frustrated) Give me your ring.
38879,Damon, What?
38880,Bonnie," Give me your ring. ( She takes his hand and tries to snatch it while Damon resists) All I've heard you say is that you have no hope and that this is your hell, so if it's so bad, why don't you just end it? (Damon pushes her back) Hope is the only thing keeping me going, Damon, so if you're really done, if you have none, then be done because this isn't helping. (She leaves from there)"
38881,Kai," Rough day, huh, Damon? Sorry. Manners. I'm Kai. Nice to meet you. Pork rind?"
38882,Elena, So you're sure you're ok to find your way back home? Sorry. My friend Caroline's having a bit of a crisis. It's been a rough couple of months for her. She's normally really sweet.
38883,Liam," Actually, I'm glad I didn't meet her because then it would have been awkward when I did this."
38884,Elena, Heh. Kissing a girl who's trying to set you up with her best friend? Red flag.
38885,Liam, Maybe. I have a sneaking suspicion that's your type.
38886,Enzo, That was Caroline's ice.
38887,Stefan," Yeah. Well, you'll be dead, so I think she'll let you off the hook."
38888,Enzo," I don't want to k*ll you, Stefan. (He takes out the wood stick from the ice bag and throws it at Jay who is standing behind Stefan with a g*n. It stabs him in the neck.)"
38889,Enzo, But it looks like he did.
38890,Caroline, I thought I told Enzo to go get more ice.
38891,Girl, Did you do it in that tone? Because I think I know why he didn't.
38892,Caroline, Congratulations. Now it's your job. (She compels her) Go get ice.
38893,Jeremy, Aren't we supposed to be having fun?
38894,Caroline, Is that why you brought your latest fling in a series of sad attempts to pretend like you don't care about Bonnie...To have fun?
38895,Enzo," Right. Cavalry's on their way, so why don't we put a pin in our little spat till this all gets sorted, eh?"
38896,Stefan," No, thanks."
38897,Enzo, You've got to be bloody kidding me. I just saved your life.
38898,Stefan," So you can give me a lifetime full of misery. Well, that's fine. I'm just gonna shorten the lifetime."
38899,Caroline, Stefan.
38900,Enzo," Good news, Caroline. I thwarted a vampire hunter. Bad news... Stefan has become a vampire hunter."
38901,Caroline, What are you doing?
38902,Stefan, Why don't you ask him?
38903,Caroline, What did you do?
38904,Damon, That is gonna have to stop.
38905,Kai," Oh, you think this is annoying? Hmm. Try listening to you and Bonnie bicker every 5 minutes."
38906,Damon, So you've been following us.
38907,Kai," Of course I have. You two are the closest thing I have a to a TV. I mean, you're no ""Baywatch,"" but...Remember ""Baywatch""?"
38908,Damon," No, I do not."
38909,Kai," Oh. Oh, man, you got to watch it. You like lifeguards, like... Hot ones?"
38910,Damon," This has been a monumentally bad day in a sea of bad days, so I'm gonna need to know who you are, what you're doing here, and how it relates to me, or I'm gonna rip your throat out."
38911,Kai," Temper's gonna get you in trouble, Damon. It's already driven Bonnie away how many times? Oh, oh, oh, wait. I know. 13."
38912,Damon, You think my temper's bad with her? I like her. You not so much. (Damon superspeeds and holds him up by his collar)
38913,Kai, Ok. Ok. Sorry. Seriously. I'm just kind of rusty on the face -to -face type human interactions.
38914,Damon, (Drops him down) Answers now.
38915,Kai, Maybe you should have a drink. That usually calms you down.
38916,Damon, Thanks.
38917,Kai," Then makes you angry, then sad, then calm again. It's a weird cycle, and look, if you really want to know the reason I'm following you, it's because I want to k*ll you."
38918,Kai, Vervain in your bourbon. Who didn't see that one coming?
38919,Kai," Who buys patio furniture from a grocery store? I mean, somebody must. Otherwise, it... it wouldn't be here, ( He picks up a beach umbrella and breaks it's wooden end into two) But now I'm a little unfamiliar with vampires, but from what I've gathered, a stake in the heart should do it, right?"
38920,Damon, Aah!
38921,Kai," You can always fight dirty, Damon. Like that time you and Bonnie played monopoly and you stole from the bank. Not cool."
38922,Damon, I'm gonna rip your head off.
38923,Kai," No. You're not. ( He smashes all the bottle on the shelf and the liquid from it burns Damon's skin and he falls to the floor again ) I didn't know which bottle you'd take, so I vervained them all. ( He raises his hand to stab Damon. )"
38924,Bonnie, Stay away from him.
38925,Kai," The useless one is here. Thank God. I've watched you try to do magic for months now. What are you gonna do, fail at me? It's embarrassing. I'm embarrassed for you."
38926,Kai, Uh -oh.
38927,Bonnie, Run.
38928,Bonnie, Phesmatos Incendia. ( Fire lights up in front of Kai)
38929,Kai, Ok. Ok. Ok.
38930,Bonnie, Giving up so soon? I'm embarrassed for you.
38931,Damon, Sorry I called you the most annoying person in the world. I hadn't met him yet. (Bonnie smiles)
38932,Tyler, Whoa. Was that always dented?
38933,Matt, What the hell does it matter? It's a keg.
38934,Tyler, Liv lent them to me man.
38935,Matt," Oh, is that when you lent Liv your manhood?"
38936,Tyler, Just lift the damn thing.
38937,Enzo," (Walks up with Jay's body on his shoulder and puts it into the back of the truck) Actually, don't. I'm in desperate need of an empty truck bed."
38938,Tyler, Isn't this your friend Jay?
38939,Matt, What the hell did you do?
38940,Enzo, I avoided the stake he planned to fire at Stefan and me.
38941,Matt, Stake?
38942,Enzo," Ah. You didn't realize your friend was a vampire hunter? Well, you do now."
38943,Matt," No. No, no. That's not possible."
38944,Enzo," Yes, it is, and as much as I'd like to watch you process what I'm sure is a dreadful revelation, I need to bury the body."
38945,Tyler, (throws the trucks keys to Enzo.)Get out of here.
38946,Caroline," Stop, ok? I am sorry. I did not know about Ivy, but..."
38947,Stefan," But what? What? I was fooling myself, I was using her as an escape? Yeah, I know what you think, Caroline."
38948,Caroline," Well, actually, I was gonna say, ""but k*ll Enzo won't bring her back."""
38949,Stefan," No, but it will stop him from reminding me of my brother. I k*ll him, I can leave this place, and I can start over again."
38950,Caroline," So that's why you left all those messages on my phone, promising apologies. That's why you visited Elena, that's why you came to this party, just to k*ll Enzo and start over?"
38951,Stefan, Yep.
38952,Caroline," I don't believe you. I know that a part of you misses this place and these people, your friends. I know that being back here reminds you how much we need you, how much... I need you, but if I'm wrong, then go ahead. Just go. Start over, but, God, if I'm right, if just a little part of you came back to check on Elena, who's had an unbearable 4 months, or Alaric, who just came back from the dead, or me... If even just a small, little part of you came back to check on me... Then stay."
38953,Jeremy, Hey. Weren't you getting ice?
38954,Girl, I was till I realized how mean that girl was to me.
38955,Jeremy, How?
38956,Girl," Um, I have self -respect. It may have taken me till I was halfway to the sip and serve to realize it, but I have it."
38957,Jeremy, Wait. Halfway to the sip and serve? Where is that specifically?
38958,Girl, I don't know. Right around route 13 when you get into Mystic Falls. Sorry about your warm booze.
38959,Jeremy, Have you guys seen Sarah?
38960,Elena, No. Why?
38961,Jeremy, There's no ice.
38962,Elena," I think you'll live, Jer."
38963,Jeremy, Caroline compelled that girl to go get ice. She didn't.
38964,Caroline," Well, why not? Is she on vervain?"
38965,Jeremy, No. She had to go into Mystic Falls to get it. She had to cross the border.
38966,Caroline, (Suddenly realising) Compulsion is magic.
38967,Jeremy," Which means that every memory you compelled away came back, so Sarah, the girl you attacked (looking at Elena)and you compelled (looking at Caroline)..."
38968,Elena, Knows what I am.
38969,Damon, You're awake. Good. Now for the Q&A portion of the evening.
38970,Kai," Let me guess. I answer right, I get a pork rind. Wrong, I get a poker."
38971,Damon," What? No, no, no. These are for me. You just get the poker."
38972,Kai, Yeah. You don't have to do that.
38973,Damon, No?
38974,Kai, We're on the same team.
38975,Bonnie, Really? Do you always try and k*ll your teammates?
38976,Kai," The important thing is that you have your magic back. It worked.(Damon and Bonnie look at each other) What, you... you didn't really think I'd k*ll Damon, did you? Heh heh. In what universe does that make sense? Who would k*ll 1/3 of our population? I'm not a monster. I knew Bonnie would show up. She always comes back, all 13 times, and I knew with the right motivation she'd be able to access her magic, although I -I did get a little worried with all your bickering that Damon's life wouldn't be enough motivation,( Damon and Bonnie look on unamused) but turns out it was. I guess that's just how you two show your love."
38977,Bonnie, So you did all that just to make sure I would have my magic?
38978,Kai, Of course I did. Because your magic is the key to getting the hell out of here.
38979,Tyler, Maybe this is an isolated thing. Jay could be working alone.
38980,Matt," Yeah. Maybe Jay, who I've known since I was 10, somehow became a vampire hunter on his own. I'm such an idiot. I spent all summer training with a founding family member, thinking that he was only worried about protecting old ladies from getting mugged."
38981,Liv, Because this is how I wanted to spend my saturday night. Load them up. What the hell happened to your truck anyway?
38982,Matt, It's a little complicated.
38983,Tyler," I got this, dude. I'll see you in a bit."
38984,Liv," Sad jocks are kind oflike sad clowns, you know, they're pathetic but kind of hilarious."
38985,Tyler," Not in the mood, Liv."
38986,Liv, Uh -oh. That sounded like a threat.
38987,Tyler, No. Just a request.
38988,Liv, Oops.
38989,Tyler, Is this what you want? You want to see my break?
38990,Liv, You're right. I'm sorry. It's just easier for me if you're an aggressive unlikable dick.
38991,Tyler, Why?
38992,Liv, So I don't have to worry about falling for you. ( They stare at each other for a moment. Liv pushes him away and leaves.)
38993,Jeremy (phoning Elena), I checked every room. Sarah is gone. And it looks like she trashed place.
38994,Elena," Okay, well, Caroline and I will go out and search her at the border then."
38995,Jeremy, I keep looking in town. I call you if I find anything.
38996,Caroline," So, I was just gonna leave my clothes here while we look, if that's okay."
38997,Elena," Yeah, of course."
38998,Caroline, I also was thinking that - you know - if there are vampire hunters on the loose then living alone right by there home base is probably not a good idea.
38999,Elena, Is this an official unpack? Because your moving methode is so confusing.
39000,Caroline," Yes, this is an official unpack. I'm sorry I got mad at you earlier. Sometimes iIt just seems like you have your secret way to move on. Is this ...?"
39001,Elena, ... Bonnie's? Yeah. There we go. You just discovered my secret of moving on: Sometimes I don't.
39002,Caroline," I miss Bonnie, I miss Mystic Falls, I miss my old life. And I miss ..."
39003,Elena, ... Stefan?
39004,Caroline," Yeah, I miss Stefan."
39005,Elena," Caroline, you and Stefan ... did you have feelings for him or something?"
39006,Caroline," Yeah, I think maybe I did. Well, we should go ahead and find that girl before she outs us."
39007,Tripp, Rough night?
39008,Enzo, Ahh. Nothing a piece of pie can't fix. (snapping his fingers) Service! Would be lovely though.
39009,Tripp," My fault, sorry. I sent her home for the night. Can have you k*ll any more of the wait staff. (He injects Enzo vervain.) Consider being more discreet when you feed. You never know whose eyes are watching."
39010,Enzo," This normally works, doesn't it? Knocks vampires right out. See, I'm a bit different than a normal vampire. I can fight the vervain. Not for long, but ... (he heads in Tripp's direction and grabs him). I will have to take care of you. (Two stakes gore Enzo and he lets Tripp off. It was Stefan who attaked Enzo with the stakes.)"
39011,Stefan, (Points at the w*apon in his hand) Found this on one of your guys. I think he k*ll him though.
39012,Tripp, Who are you?
39013,Stefan, Stefan Salvatore. You and I have something in common.
39014,Tripp," One of the founding families. THank you. Acutally, if you don't mind - I have my own way I liked him to die."
39015,Stefan, (hands Tripp the w*apon) Just make sure it's painfull.
39016,Caroline, k*ll Enzo won't bring her back.
39017,Jeremy, Sarah... The girl you attacked and you compelled...
39018,Damon, Where the hell are we?
39019,Bonnie, 1994.
39020,Bonnie, There's someone else here.
39021,Kai, We're on the same team.
39022,Kai," And, of course, I broke into the Oval Office, and took a picture of myself at the window looking all JFK. But then, I was, like...wha - how am I going to get these photos developed - "
39023,Damon," (interrupts) Oh my god, just answer the damn question. How are we going to get out of this Twilight Zone? (Damon is sitting across from him in a dark couch.)"
39024,Kai," I got a question for you, first. Why do you think we're stuck on a repeating loop of May 10th, 1994?"
39025,Kai," Doomed to relive a solar eclipse forever and ever, and ever."
39026,Damon, How the hell should I know? (He takes a sip of his bourbon.)
39027,Kai," Well, I heard you tell Bonnie this place was your own personal hell. I'm curious why."
39028,Bonnie," (walks into the room) I found everything you asked for: can -opener, shower drain, grinding wheel, jam. Pocket kn*fe, volume ""O"" of the Encyclopedia, a nail and a black marker."
39029,Bonnie, Now what?
39030,Kai, Can't show you with my hands taped. 
39031,Damon, (warningly) Bonnie...
39032,Kai, Thank you.
39033,Damon, Okay.
39034,Damon, Fine. How is this pile of crap going to get us out of here?
39035,Kai," (rubs his sore wrists) I'll explain... as soon as you tell me what you did on May 10th, 1994."
39036,Damon, (frustrated) What difference does it make!? 
39037,Kai, Let me put it this way - Bonnie's magic is one part of the equation. My as -yet undisclosed knowledge is the other. Which means you would be hitching a ride home for free. I just want to know if you deserve to come along.
39038,Damon, Or I could just torture you until you say something useful. 
39039,Kai," (confused, speaks slowly) If you torture me, I'll get mad and then I won't want to help you. (he looks toward Bonnie) ...What kind of person needs to have that explained to them?"
39040,Bonnie, Play nice.
39041,Damon, Stop trying to impress the new guy. 
39042,Bonnie, Why don't you just tell him your story?
39043,Damon," Maybe because I don't want to talk about the worst thing I ever did, Bonnie."
39044,Kai," Ooooh, now I'm listening. (He scoops out some jam from the jar with his hand and eats it)  "
39045,Damon, Ready for some bad news?
39046,Damon," Barely seen you in 50 years, Stefan. You could invite a brother in."
39047,Stefan, Give me one good reason why.
39048,Damon," Check your answering machine, I'm trying to turn over a new leaf."
39049,Stefan," Oh, I heard your message. I also heard you sent Lexi some flowers, 17 years after you left her to burn to death on a rooftop."
39050,Damon, Well - 
39051,Stefan," It's a little late, but I see you're trying to make amends. I just want to know why."
39052,Damon," Uh, well, I can tell you this, Stefan - I'm tired of tearing up New York City. And, maybe it's the partying, or maybe it's my conscious - "
39053,Stefan," Well, I believe that word would require one."
39054,Damon," (ignores him) - and then, I had this moment of clarity, and I said. ""Wouldn't it be great if I just woke up in my own bed and could have a fresh start?"""
39055,Zach, You must be Damon.
39056,Stefan," Damon, this is, uh, Zach Salvatore. He owns the house now, he knows the family house tree, and I told him if you got out of line, I'd take care of you myself. "
39057,Damon," Why you always expecting the worst out of me, Stefan? "
39058,Stefan," Oh, I don't. Otherwise, I wouldn't allow this."
39059,Zach," Come on in, Damon."
39060,Damon," Huh. (he takes steps into the house, smiling) Thanks. (He brushes past Stefan after tapping his shoulder)"
39061,Stefan, You ready to start over?
39062,Damon, Hell yeah.  
39063,Stefan, Hello. Any sign of our runaway girl?
39064,Elena," No, Caroline and I combed the border of Mystic Falls three times already. No sign of Sarah."
39065,Stefan," She's not on any of the roads, which means she's probably in Mystic Falls. "
39066,Elena," This is bad, Stefan. Her compulsion went away as soon as she crossed the border. She knows that Caroline and I are vampires. "
39067,Stefan," Listen, I gotta go. I'll uh, talk to you later."
39068,Elena, Where do you think you're going?
39069,Stefan," (chuckles) Uh, I'm going home. "
39070,Elena," Savannah is not your home, Stefan. It's an escape, a hiding place. This is your home."
39071,Stefan," No, it was my home. But, I can no longer enter its borders, therefore I have a new home. "
39072,Elena," (raises her eyebrows) So, you're just going to throw in the towel and go back to your fake new life?"
39073,Stefan," Look, my fake new life ended when Enzo decided to k*ll my not -so -fake girlfriend, Ivy. So, I am going to go home, pack up and start over. Again."
39074,Elena, By pretending like your life here never existed? 
39075,Stefan," You'd be surprised how easy it is to forget the past, Elena."
39076,Elena, But I'm not buying it. You lost your brother. There's no way that you're fine.
39077,Stefan," You do not have to worry about me. It's not like I haven't done this before, I have a system. "
39078,Elena," Show me. Prove to me that your system works. If I believe that you actually are happy, then I'll let you go. But if I don't buy it, which I probably won't, I will keep harrassing you until you come home. (she scrunches up her nose) And, I'm talking about like Enzo -sized harrassment."
39079,Elena, Deal?
39080,Stefan, Sure.
39081,Stefan," And what about our runaway girl, Sarah? "
39082,Elena," Well, we can't step foot into Mystic Falls. So now, it's up to Matt and Jeremy.  "
39083,Alaric, Atta boy. Get her all out.
39084,Matt, (voiceover) Is he seriously still wasted? 
39085,Alaric," Yeah, little punk showed up on my doorstep at four in the morning. Drunk. I thought you two were looking for Sarah together."
39086,Jeremy," (groans) I did my part, she is definitely not hiding in the Salvatore liquor cabinet."
39087,Alaric," Listen, what about your vampire -hating neighborhood watch guy? If Sarah goes to him for help, that's a problem."
39088,Matt, (in his car) I'm on my way to Tripp's office now. I think I can get him to trust me and tell me what he knows.
39089,Alaric, Be safe. (He hangs up.)
39090,Jo, Alaric  
39091,Alaric, Hi. (He stands up.)
39092,Jo, Who do we have here?
39093,Alaric, This is Jeremy... (He stands Jeremy up with one arm.) Jeremy Gilbert. He's a little...
39094,Jo, Underage?
39095,Alaric, Yeah...
39096,Jo," Yeah, I can see that."
39097,Alaric," I was hoping you could give him one of those, uh... rapid -rehydration hangover -cure -type things?"
39098,Jo," (gives Jeremy a look) Oh, yeah. You mean, the ones we reserve for professional athletes and starving children in third -world countries? Yeah. I think we'll start with a full workup...(She holds an empty urine cup up and hands it to Jeremy.) Physical, bl*od, toxicology..."
39099,Alaric," Yeah. Why don't you throw in an STD screening while you're at it, huh?"
39100,Jeremy, (takes the cup and rolls his eyes) Really?
39101,Alaric, Yeah!
39102,Jo, (to Jeremy) Down the hall to the right.
39103,Jo, (winces) Do I want to know? 
39104,Alaric, It's just another day in the life of an Occult Studies professor.
39105,Jo," Well, if that entails supervising drunk morons, then you and I have a lot more in common than I thought!"
39106,Tripp," I know, and I'm sorry, Karen. Jay was a good kid. (Seeing Matt in the hallway he gestures for him to come in.) I promise, you'll be the first one to know, okay. (He hangs up and sits back in the chair.)"
39107,Matt," Tripp, are you okay?"
39108,Tripp (sitting up), No. No. I just told Jay's parents that I was the one who found their son dead in the woods last night.
39109,Matt," I heard, do you know what happened?"
39110,Tripp, You tell me.
39111,Tripp, He went to the party with you.
39112,Matt," I -I don't know. He was drunk... I offered to give him a ride home, and he said he'd walk... I should have, driven him home."
39113,Tripp," Okay. I'm gonna give the sheriff my statement - (Tripp stands up, waving his arms) - and try to make sense of what happened to Jay."
39114,Matt (standing also), Wait. Maybe I should go with you. I mean I might have been the last person to see Jay alive.
39115,Tripp (staring at Matt), Ok. Done. Let's take a ride. (They walk out together.)
39116,Kai," I need to be entertained, while I work."
39117,Kai (singing)," ♪ Hell story, please ♪"
39118,Damon, Remind me not to k*ll him.
39119,Bonnie (moving her head), Maybe telling him your story will take your mind off of it.
39120,Damon, Whose side are you on? -
39121,Bonnie, The side where we get to go home to the people we love.
39122,Damon (after a prolonging moment), Fine.
39123,Damon," On May 1994, I was living here. I'd come home to walk the straight and narrow."
39124,Damon, Can I have a sip of that? I'm starving.Stefan: Suure. (He emphasized.)
39125,Damon, Whoo. (He unscrews the cap and takes a swig.)
39126,Stefan, Mmmm..
39127,Stefan," It's good, right?"
39128,Damon," Um -uh. (He's holding the bl*od in his mouth even though it's disgusting, his lips contorted.)"
39129,Stefan," Oh, yeah. I can't remember if that squirrel was k*ll or one I caught in the rat trap."
39130,Stefan," Better hope it was k*ll, though, because the rat trap was full of rat droppings."
39131,Stefan, Swish your tongue around.
39132,Stefan (rubbing two fingers together)," Does it feel like hair, or is it more of a grainy pellet?"
39133,Damon," Ugh - (He looks relieved,)"
39134,Damon," How's it going, Zach? What's up with all the grocery trips?"
39135,Zach, Ah. One of the boarders is craving blueberry pancakes. (He continues his way to the house.)
39136,Damon," You know, maybe I should run the Salvatore boarding house - "
39137,Damon," Take over for Zach, get in good with Gail."
39138,Stefan," She's on vervain. So is Zach, which means hands off."
39139,Damon (from the bourbon station), Perfect. Our savior's insane and narcoleptic.
39140,Kai," No, no, no, I'm awake."
39141,Kai, Let me guess... You k*ll the pregnant woman.
39142,Damon," Shut up, Kai. You weren't listening."
39143,Kai," I was listening in my sleep. You were hanging out with your distant nephew Zach, who you called uncle Zach because that's not confusing. Plus pregnant lady Gail, who had a big bull's -eye on her chest. Got it."
39144,Bonnie (turns to Damon), Tell me you didn't k*ll a pregnant woman.
39145,Kai," Oh, that's totally what happened. Why else would today be his personal hell?"
39146,Kai," Oh, here we go."
39147,Damon," The only reason that you're alive right now is because I thought you could get us out of here and you could help us, but you don't HAVE any answers! You're just a man -child - (he picks up an empty jam can) - with Jam on your fingers! (He tosses the can to the side.)"
39148,Kai," Okay then, to get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic. It's called an ascendant, and it looks like this, Damon (he picks up something, it's round, black and red.) The last time we had it, was in the pacific north west. (He opens a book, and sets it down.): Oregon."
39149,Bonnie, We?
39150,Kai," It belonged to my family. So, (He picks up the pocket kn*fe.) here's a little bl*od to get you started - (He slits the top of his finger.) Now all we need, is a locator spell. (He stands, eyes on Bonnie.) To pinpoint its whereabouts."
39151,Damon," Think you can find our ticket out of here, Bon -bon?"
39152,Bonnie (unfazed)," Hell, yeah."
39153,Elena, She's cute.
39154,Stefan, Was cute. 
39155,Elena, I'm sorry.
39156,Stefan," Me too. But what's done is done. So, after taxes and social security and health ensurance, I'm left with 206,003 cents to spend for the week. Do you wanna get drunk?"
39157,Elena, Stefan? Health ensurance?
39158,Stefan, Yeah. Point is to start over. Pretend to be as human as possible. 
39159,Elena," Okay so no vampire previliges, no bagage, nothing from our old lifes whatsover, huh? (She points at Stefan's car.) What's this? "
39160,Stefan," You got me there. Damon isn't around calling it granny -mobile, so ..."
39161,Elena," Yeah, your brother really did love to torture people with nicknames. And just torture people. "
39162,Stefan, That's one way to put it. 
39163,Elena," So, your system for moving on requires both burning bridge and a dead -end -Job.  "
39164,Stefan, We haven't even gone for the fun part. 
39165,Elena, Paying utilities? 
39166,Stefan," No. Deciding we wanna be for the next thirty years. You wanna be an astronaut, you wanna be an olympic athlete, you wanna skip med school - boom, you're a doctor! Right? Challenge me. I show you how it's done.  "
39167,Elena," Alright, Let see what you got."
39168,Stefan, Okay.
39169,Jo," Quite a boozer, that kid. Put him on a saline drip he's lucky I didn't pump his stomach."
39170,Alaric," Yeah, you know, he's had a rough couple months."
39171,Jo, Did you bring him in here to put a Band -Aid on it and make some more excuses?
39172,Alaric," No, I acutally came here for some advice from a professional."
39173,Jo," Well, a kick in the ass might help. Jeremy too. Look. If he's anything like his sister, I'm sure he'll be fine. It's nothing I don't treat every single night on campus or didn't do myself when I was a student. Alaric"
39174,Alaric, Okay.
39175,Jo, What about you? Born a party animal?
39176,Alaric," Oh, yeah, yeah. I used to get kicked out library all the time, you know. Because it was closing."
39177,Jo, Right. Head in a Wiccan bible?
39178,Jo," Okay, one more piece of professional advice: When a successfull, sexy and only moderatly insecure doctor is flirting with you, give her your undivided attention."
39179,Elena," Caroline's laying low at the dorm, no sign of Sarah yet, which means she's either hiding out or she's planning her nightly news exclusive to out me."
39180,Stefan," Well, if she does out you then you start your life over somewhere else. With all the supernatural drunks."
39181,Elena, Right.
39182,Stefan," So, you're ready to see the system in action?"
39183,Elena, Ready.
39184,Stefan, Alright. Hand over your ring.
39185,Elena, What?
39186,Stefan, Your ring.
39187,Elena, Okay. (Hands him the ring)
39188,Stefan, Elena Williams.
39189,Elena (playing along)," Stefan Cooper, what are you doing?"
39190,Stefan, We'd known each other for a very long time now. And you've always been my best friend. I've always loved you. And I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. Will you - 
39191,Elena," Wait! You're not just proposing to me because I'm pregnant, are you?"
39192,Stefan," No. No. I -I am proposing to you because you are my rock, ok? You have stood by my side through the multiple rehabs, the jail time, the bull fighting injury. I mean, you have brought me back from the edge, and, sweetheart, this baby is the best thing that ever happened to us. Will you marry me?"
39193,Elena (with tears of joy in her eyes), Yes.
39194,Stefan (whipsering in Elenas ear)," New identities, new lives, it's easy. (speaking up) Thank you all so much!"
39195,Bonnie, It doesn't feel right. Maybe I need a bigger map.
39196,Damon," Maybe you started practising, you suck at magic now."
39197,Kai," Ignore him, Bonnie. Pretend he's a white noise machine. That's how I used to  tune out my siblings. I grew up with a ton of little sisters and brothers, you know, all of them constantly yammering. (He comes closer to Bonnie.) But it tought me how to focus. (He looks like he's about to kiss her.)"
39198,Damon," Easy there, big brother! She doesn't know you. At least buy her a drink."
39199,Damon, May I call you Liz?
39200,Liz, Sure.
39201,Damon, Your daughter is so adorable
39202,Liz," Yeah. Caroline's high maintenance, but she's worth it."
39203,Gail," I'm so getting rid of that photo! Stefan, come, take a picture of Zach and me."
39204,Stefan, Sure.
39205,Zach, Thanks.
39206,Gail, And now back to my cravings.
39207,Stefan," Hey, what happened to your wrist?"
39208,Gail, I don't know.
39209,Liz, So how does this thing help us watch the eclipse?
39210,Damon," You put it between you and the thing that is too hot to look. (He puts it between Liz and himself.) Ah, it works."
39211,Liz (laughing), My husband will get to kick out you. We should you invite to dinner sometime.
39212,Stefan, Damon? What did you do to Gail?
39213,Liz, Is everything okay?
39214,Damon, Looks like the jig is up. (Compelling Liz) Hey. Look at me. Go home. Forget you ever met us.
39215,Stefan, How the hell did you feed on Gail? She's on vervain.
39216,Damon," Yeah, in her coffee. I swapped it out last week. Same for Zach."
39217,Stefan, These people are my friends. Zach is family. They trust me.
39218,Damon," They trust us both! Look, no feeding inside the house, right? Snatch, eat, erase. It's all completely functional, Stefan. I told you: soon start!"
39219,Kai, The spell's leading to South Virginia. That can't be right.
39220,Bonnie," M -m, the spell's working. Showing we're in Mystic Falls. It feels so close. (The candles are beaming.) It's right here. (As she touches Kai's chest, the candles go out.)"
39221,Kai, Very good.
39222,Bonnie, That's the ascendent?
39223,Kai, The one and only.
39224,Damon," Thanks for the mind games, jackass."
39225,Kai," It was just another little test. To make sure Bonnies magic was presice enough for the spell. I do believe, you're ready. Pack your bags - we're going home."
39226,Stefan," So here's what I don't get, Damon. Why'd you insinuate yourself back into my life and then cheat and lie and break all the rules?"
39227,Damon," Well, because I may be mad. Believe me or not, I like being here, Stefan."
39228,Stefan," You get your daylight ring back, when you decide to behave. Now, answer my question: Why did you come back here?"
39229,Damon," Because I missed my brother. I don't have a connection to my humanity, Stefan. I wanted to feel something again. And when I came back home, it all came rushing back, just like I hoped it would."
39230,Stefan, Congrats. Now what?
39231,Damon," Come on, man. Let's just hit the road, you and me. Huh? I'll let you drive my car, I'll get you off this vegan diet, teach you how to feed again. It'll be great, Stef. Huh? What do you say? Come on! Trust me."
39232,Stefan," Uh, I can imagine a road trip with you. I can imagine you feeding on innocent people and uh leaving a trail of bodies behind. I can image you making me drink human bl*od and laughing at my while i suffer."
39233,Damon," Way to be an optimist, Stefan."
39234,Stefan," Just looking at the facts, Damon. 1912 you convinced me to drink human bl*od again which is why I became a ripper. 1942 you almost pushed me out the rails again, because you were so damn needy. 1977 you left my best friend to die, after I sent her to come help you. And now I'm finally happy. I have a new life and doing well and you just can't handle that, can you, Damon?"
39235,Damon, I'm not trying to screw up your damn new life.
39236,Stefan," You don't have to try, Damon. All you have to do is exist. Because no matter what I do or where I go, you will be with me forever, trying to destroy every single thing that I build. I don't know why I thought this time would be any different. I wanted it to be different. You just keep failing."
39237,Damon," Guess that's a no on the road trip, huh?"
39238,Stefan, That's a NO on the road trip.
39239,Elena," So according to Caroline, Sarah's still M.I.A. and now Enzo's missing."
39240,Stefan," Probably out, k*ll someone else's girlfriend."
39241,Stefan," Hey, hey, pregnant, remember?"
39242,Elena, Dumbest lie I've ever told. Can I just take that one back?
39243,Stefan," No, but you'll have to reinvent yourself in 30 years. If you don't, people will start asking why you're not getting any older."
39244,Elena," But when I first met you, you said you'd been away from Mystic Falls for 15 years. What made you come back at half the schedule?"
39245,Stefan," You said it yourself: I met you. Since 1864 I have been a carpenter, an ambulance driver, immigrant worker, high school student."
39246,Elena, So then why auto mechanic for 200 bucks a week?
39247,Stefan, No reason.
39248,Elena," Yeah, it must be hard. All that change without a constantly life. We haven't talked about your brother."
39249,Stefan, We are to refer that Damon is just my brother?
39250,Elena, What else would I call him?
39251,Stefan, I don't even know anymore.
39252,Elena, Anymore? What does that mean?
39253,Stefan," You know, it's ... uh ... it's not important. Things change, right? (He rises his glas) To change."
39254,Elena," Who cares what do people think, right? To change."
39255,Damon," You are wandering around like a crazy man, why?"
39256,Kai, Looking for the exact right spot. We need to found where the power of the eclipse is focused.
39257,Bonnie, You know you could have just shown us the Ascendent to begin with.
39258,Kai," Yeah, but I wanted to feel your hand on my chest."
39259,Bonnie, There's something not right about him.
39260,Damon, You're just not used to guys hitting on you.
39261,Bonnie, You know I can't wait to get out of here and talk to somebody else.
39262,Damon, Can we just have a few lasting seconds of peace while this idiot uses that thing to get the stars to align?
39263,Damon," Hey, what's up with the nature walk?"
39264,Kai, I used the Ascendent to figure out where we need to be standing during the eclipse.
39265,Damon, Great. Let's do some magic and get the hell out of here.
39266,Bonnie, (whispering) Oregon.
39267,Damon, What?
39268,Bonnie, I read this paper like a thousand times and something in it about Oregon.
39269,Damon, What about it?
39270,Bonnie, You know Kai said he had all this brothers and sisters.
39271,Damon, Mhm.
39272,Bonnie," Family massacred in Portland. The only one missing was the oldest boy, 22 year old named Malakai."
39273,Kai, Who names a kid Malakai? It's like they expected me to be evil.
39274,Bonnie, All these kids were m*rder!
39275,Kai, Hello! Not everyone died. I had a soft spot for one of my sisters. Cuz otherwise I would've cut her lungs out. And not just her spleen.
39276,Bonnie, What?
39277,Kai, You can survive without a spleen.
39278,Damon, Something tells me you're not speaking high pathetically.
39279,Kai," Well, these two, I, uh, hung off a stairwell railing. Then I put a hunting kn*fe in her abdomen, and him I drowned in the pool. He kept fighting me. I was like, ""I saved you for last, you ungrateful little...""Anyway, that was that."
39280,Bonnie, You just k*ll your whole family?
39281,Kai," Coven, to be precise. Oh, you know, family of witches."
39282,Damon, You're making a jump to whoops and you're a witch.
39283,Kai," Sort of, yeah. No powers, obviously. Oh, and of course, Gemini Coven did not take it too well what I did in Portland. So they banished me here."
39284,Bonnie, (to Damon) This place is a prison. (to Kai) They created it for you.
39285,Kai," Yep. This place isn't your hell, Damon. It's mine."
39286,Jeremy, You call this a fair fight? You're basically an Original Vampire.
39287,Alaric, You've k*ll an Original before. Focus your head in the game and maybe keep it out of the bottle.
39288,Jeremy, Happy?
39289,Alaric," I'm trying to help you pull yourself together, Jeremy. Now what is your problem?"
39290,Jeremy, My problem is that everyone thinks I shouldn't have one. I have the right to be myself right now. Bonnie is dead. She knew it was gonna happening and she said goodbye over the phone! Just so you - 
39291,Alaric," Keep going so what? So I can come back to life, right?"
39292,Jeremy," You, Elena, Stefan, Tyler, Enzo. She saved everybody but herself!"
39293,Alaric," You wanna talk about resentment, huh? Is that it? My wife ran away, because she would rather be a vampire than be married to me. Came to find out it was Damon who turned her. And then she died. And then Jenna - she died. And then I died. And then the guy who k*ll my wife died. And I actually kinda miss him. And now I can't even talk to a girl without fantasising biting into her neck. I mean, Jeremy, I have resentment for years, YEARS! I get it. Okay? But I find a way to keep going. Because that's what we do: We find a way TO KEEP GOING! Ready?"
39294,Elena," So, if we were to run into each other in some random town in 30 years, do we pretend like we're strangers?"
39295,Stefan," Elena, I'm avoiding Mystic Falls, not you. We can talk, we can visit."
39296,Elena," Bye, Stefan."
39297,Stefan, Bye
39298,Stefan," Hey, man. Noticed you weren't celebrating my engagement. How come?"
39299,Guy, Hard to be happy for the guy who put my brother in a hospital?
39300,Stefan," Oh, right, right, right, okay. Remind me, which guy was it? Broken nose or fractured arm? I was kinda drunk. Still waiting for the congrats on my engagement. (He grabs the guys cheeks to make it seem like he is speaking.) I'm really happy for you."
39301,Stefan," Don't know what you got. Come on Come on, man. Hit me. Come on."
39302,Guy," You're freaking enjoying this, you sick freak?"
39303,Elena (compelling the guy)," Go home, clean up and forget this ever happened. (to Stefan): What the hell are you doing?"
39304,Bonnie," I'm not letting Kai out of here, okay? He just said, he's a serial k*ll."
39305,Damon, I don't care. I wanna get out of here.
39306,Bonnie, How can you not care? Maybe because of the horrible things you have done? Maybe cause k*ll a bunge of kids is not a big deal to someone who has m*rder a pregnant woman? Am I wrong?
39307,Stefan (to Zach), Did you leave the door open?
39308,Zach, No. Why?
39309,Damon, This eclipse party blows. I didn't see the sun at all when I made it across the yard. I forgot how much stronger we are when we drink human bl*od.
39310,Gail (scared), Zach.
39311,Stefan," Damon, please don't hurt her."
39312,Damon," I want my ring back, Stefan. (Stefan throws the ring to Damon.) Attaboy."
39313,Stefan," I'm never gonna be right at you, am I?"
39314,Damon," No. I do not. Cause in 1912 I showed you who you were, Stefan. In 1942 I gave you your freedom and in 1977 I almost k*ll your best friend because it should have been you there to help me, Stefan. You owe me and it'll take you an eternity to pay me back."
39315,Damon," An eternity of misery, brother. Just like the promise."
39316,Kai, Ouch. Poor nephew -uncle Zach.
39317,Damon," Stefan compelled uncle Zach to forget about the girlfriend and the baby. But he couldn't cover up all those m*rder. Founder's council was restarted and Stefan took off, left Mystic Falls for about 15 years. We both did. And when I saw uncle Zach again, I couldn't look at him without remembering that I ruined everything. So it was a releave when I got to k*ll him. Can we go back now?"
39318,Kai," Oh, come on, Bonnie. You wanna go home to your friends, I wanna go back and give the rest of the Gemini coven an excruciating death. Win -win."
39319,Damon," Look, Bonnie, but I gotta get back. Not just for Elena, but for my brother."
39320,Bonnie," Sorry, Damon."
39321,Kai, Sorry doesn't work for me.
39322,Damon," We may be having a bit of an disagreement, but don't ever lay a hand on her."
39323,Kai, Kind of a non-issue now. Missed today's eclipse. Rain check for tomorrow.
39324,Bonnie, No.
39325,Matt, You and the Sheriff. Don't seem to get along.
39326,Tripp," Oh. Liz and my wife were high-school rivals, some issue about who was captain of the field hockey team."
39327,Matt, You were married?
39328,Tripp," I was. Yeah, Chris died in a car accident."
39329,Matt, Sorry.
39330,Tripp, So I left Mystic Falls. Too many memories.
39331,Matt, So what did you tell the Sheriff about Jay?
39332,Tripp," Just what I saw. Uh, tons of bl*od. Probably a mountain lion."
39333,Matt," Just another animal attack, huh?"
39334,Tripp, You sound awful.
39335,Matt," This is gonna sound weird. But last night Jay told me that he was tracking a vampire. I mean that's crazy, right?"
39336,Tripp, I'm gonna show you something.
39337,Stefan, I thought you agreed to leave.
39338,Elena," I forgot my jacket, Stefan. What happened with that guy?"
39339,Stefan, Told you I have a system.
39340,Elena, Letting somebody kick your ass ... so that you can feel?
39341,Stefan, You are the last person who should be lecturing me on coping mechanisms.
39342,Elena," You're not alone in your grief, Stefan. I lost Bonnie when you lost Damon. But I fought through it."
39343,Stefan, All by yourself.
39344,Elena, Yes. And it was hard. I know that you're pushing me away because I never liked Damon.
39345,Stefan," Believe me, that's not what it is."
39346,Elena," I know that he's your brother, i get it. But why inflict so much pain to yourself for such a hateful person? I mean, he doesn't deserve your grief. I mean, there's gotta be another way so you can move on."
39347,Stefan," I'm sorry that I can't just forget him like you, Elena."
39348,Elena, No one's forgetting him.
39349,Stefan, You are. You erased him.
39350,Elena, What are you talking about?
39351,Stefan, You had Alaric compell you to forget every good thing that Damon ever did. You made him a monster in your own mind because you couldn't handle the grief of losing him.
39352,Elena, I don't believe anyhting that you're saying. Why would I do that?
39353,Stefan," Because you were in love with him and he was in love with you. And when Damon died, a part of you died too."
39354,Elena, Wow. What? No. No. Stefan ... how can I possibly love Damon?
39355,Stefan," Believe me, I asked myself that for a very long time. And eventually I saw it. Damon inspired you. He pushed you to own the darkest parts of yourself. And when you died, he was the only one that could made you feel alive again. And you made him feel human. You loved Damon for the same reasons that I loved Damon. Because in spite of every single thing he did, we couldn't live without him. Now you don't have to - but I do. So, I do it my way. You do it yours."
39356,Matt, What is this place?
39357,Tripp," A secret. A secret I only share with people I trust. Remeber the gas leak in town over the summer? Well, I came back to make sure my grandmother was ok. First time I've been back in years. When I crossed town boarder, something changed. Memories came flooding back. And I realised, that my wife didn't die in a car accident. She was m*rder. Drained of her bl*od right in front of me. And the k*ll made me believe, I was responsible. And I found out what kind of monster could do all that."
39358,Tripp," They are real, and one m*rder my wife, but this is the one who m*rder Jay, and I'm gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies, starting with the one who bit your friend Sarah."
39359,Jeremy, Sarah?
39360,Sarah, You try anything and I call 911 and out your vampire sister to the world.
39361,Jeremy, Just take it easy. What do you want?
39362,Sarah, Answers. I found this (she shows him a picture) when I was tossing the house last night. That's my mum. And the reason I know this is because I've had this (she shows him another picture) since I was a baby. My mum was a Jane Doe Her body was still warm and entered the hospital six months pregnant. But one doctor did an emergency C -section and I survived. Three months in an incubator. They didn't know who my dad was. And neither did I. But then I found this (she shows him another picture. Jeremy takes it.).
39363,Jeremy, Your dad is Zach Salvatore.
39364,Elena, How could you obliterate an entire chapter of my life?
39365,Alaric," Look Elena, as much is I'd like to think that I am full of wisdom, I think it's time we stop pretending that I actually know what's best, okay? Look, I've got my own issues to solve right now and I think that this will explain it much better than I can. (He hands Elena a little blue book.)"
39366,Elena (reading out loud)," Dear me, if you're reading this than somebody spilled the beans about your selective memory loss. My mind is on Caroline. Yes, you loved Damon. You loved him with a passion that consumed you. And then when Damon died, the void you feeled was too deep, too dark. Facing an eternity without your soulmate you went of the deep end. You turned into someone that you weren't. A monster. Alaric will restore your last memories - all you have to do is ask. But I hope that you don't. I tried it the other way and I didn't see an end to the pain. I want you to rediscover yourself in absence of who defined you. If you feel any hope for the future at all, then you're already better off. You've been given a chance to start over. I want you to take it. I want you to be happy."
39367,Alaric," So, what do you want me to do?"
39368,Elena (hands him the book), Can you hold on to that? And keep it save in case I ever need to read it again.
39369,Damon, Shame eating?
39370,Bonnie, Thinking about that pregnant Lady. She had a thing for pancakes.
39371,Damon, That's what you remember?
39372,Bonnie," You remember it, don't you? You make pancakes every day."
39373,Damon, Cuase I'm bored.
39374,Bonnie, No. Cause you're punishing yourself. You call this place your hell and it makes you feel remorse. That makes you different from Kai. There is hope for you.
39375,Damon," Look. We can still get out of here, Bonnie. We can just steal that ascendant contraption, find out what Kai knows. We'll ditch him. Because he ain't got powers anyway."
39376,Kai (suddenly appearing at the door), Actually it's not that simple.
39377,Damon," You gotta stop doing that, creepy."
39378,Kai, Here's a thing: I have a k*ll effect on magic. I can't generate it myself. But I can consume it from others temporarely. My family callled me an abomination. That hurt my feelings.
39379,Damon," Okay, get it!"
39380,Kai, You can see why my coven and I didn't get along.
39381,Damon, I smell an ultimatum.
39382,Kai," If I consume all of Bonnie's magic I'm just gonna end up k*ll her. But if we work together, we can all go home as friends. Or I can develop her magic, k*ll you both and go home alone. What's it gonna be?"
39383,Stefan, Hello?
39384,Stefan, Ivy.
39385,Ivy, Stefan. I don't feel so good. Your friend Enzo drink his bl*od and now I'm so thirsty.
39386,Stefan, That's my girlfriend Ivy. Somebody k*ll her last night right in front of me.
39387,Tripp, Vampires m*rder my wife. 
39388,Stefan, Hello?
39389,Tripp," Hey, Tripp Cooke. I, ah, just wanted to thank you for turning over that vampire Enzo to me. He's been very helpful. (Tripp emphasized.)"
39390,Stefan," Enzo? I-I thought, thought you were supposed to k*ll him."
39391,Tripp," Oh I will, eventually. Once I know everything he does."
39392,Stefan (moving his lips as if he were to say something else but then thought better of it)," So, what has he told you?"
39393,Tripp," Sounds like the vampire problem in Mystic Falls isn't as bad as I thought, I mean if he had any names he'd have given them up. (Tripp is sitting in the back of his truck, looking at all these stakes.) Lord knows I've done plenty of things to get him to talk."
39394,Stefan," Well that's um, good to hear."
39395,Tripp," Yeah, seems like it's moved on to Savannah. I've sent some of my guys down there, they're gonna check it out, see what they find."
39396,Stefan (nodding)," Thanks for the, uh, heads up."
39397,Tripp," Founding families, gotta stick together."
39398,Stefan, Absolutely.
39399,Stefan, Ivy?
39400,Stefan (stepping over the strewn mess), You redecorated.
39401,Ivy," I should probably tell you I k*ll your boss. (Stefan looks down at this.) Dean? I woke up and he was burying me in the woods, I drank every drop of his bl*od. It wasn't enough."
39402,Stefan (breathing deeply)," Yeah, I know the feeling."
39403,Ivy (stepping forward), Then why aren't you helping me?
39404,Stefan (raising his voice), I'm trying to help you.
39405,Ivy," Two bl*od bags and a lesson on sunlight? Wow, thanks a million. (She walks back to the fridge."
39406,Stefan," Listen, I have to get you out of Savannah."
39407,Ivy," Hey, I am dead because of you. Because you lied to me about who you were. Because your friend Enzo turned me into something straight out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer!"
39408,Stefan," Ivy, calm down, when you are a vampire your emotions are heightened."
39409,Ivy," You think? Look at me, I used to be a decent person, I got good grades, I went home for Christmas, I had a fricking etsy store!"
39410,Stefan," Ivy, please."
39411,Ivy," And now, I am a k*ll. And all I am going to do is k*ll more, and more, and it's all your fault."
39412,Caroline, Stefan? Wh-what are you...?
39413,Stefan (pushing past her carrying a black trunk), I need a favor. (He drops it on the floor.)
39414,Caroline, What are you doing? And what is with this trunk? (She leans down to open it.)
39415,Stefan (closing the curtains), Hang on.
39416,Caroline," Oh, my god!"
39417,Ivy, Where am I? (Looking at Stefan.) What did you do?
39418,Caroline," Ivy, wha... how did this happen?"
39419,Stefan," Uh, Enzo turned her."
39420,Ivy, Then Stefan broke my neck and I woke up in a trunk.
39421,Stefan," Right. So, I need a little bit of help."
39422,Caroline," No, (she looks at Ivy.) No, no, no."
39423,Stefan," Just watch her for a little while, while I get Luke to make her a daylight ring."
39424,Stefan," Show her the ropes, teach her some control."
39425,Caroline," No, no. This is not my mess. (She points at him.) This is your mess."
39426,Stefan, A mess that wouldn't have happened if you had just left me alone.
39427,Ivy (behind caroline)," Um, I can hear you, you know? I can hear everything, like, perfectly."
39428,Caroline, Do I need to remind you that there is a vampire hunter lurking around?
39429,Stefan," He's not here. He's in Savannah, which is why we're not."
39430,Ivy (plopping on caroline's bed)," You know the real tragedy in all this? I read ""he's just not that into you,"" and..."
39431,Stefan and Caroline, Shut up!
39432,Stefan," Look, Tripp Cooke has somehow decided to become the eastern seaboard's self-proclaimed vampire hunter. None of us are safe, if we can't control ourselves. If anybody can teach her, it's you."
39433,Caroline," Yeah? Well, you don't have to flatter me because I already know that."
39434,Stefan," All right? So just a couple of hours, and then you'll never have to deal with me again."
39435,Caroline, Is that what you think I want?
39436,Stefan," I don't know, you tell me."
39437,Caroline, Okay.
39438,Ivy, When do we eat?
39439,Alaric," Homecoming, (he reads, turning toward his class-filled room.) All right. By a show of hands, who knows the supernatural origin of tonight's homecoming party? (No one raises their hands, and Elena gives Alaric a small wave and a smile.)"
39440,Alaric," A civil w*r soldier Nathan Whitmore horribly disfigured throughout countless battles somehow survived them all just so he could get home to the woman he loved, and when he finally got home to his farm, he found her in bed with his brother, and did what any sane man would do...He m*rder his brother in cold bl*od and then chased the love of his life out into the cornfields."
39441,"Tyler (uninterested, turns to Liv)"," I got to run some gear over to the football stadium later. If you want, I could pick you up after, and we could go together."
39442,Liv," You mean, like a date?"
39443,Liv, Because definitely not.
39444,Alaric," But the legend goes...That lady Whitmore is out on this night every year dressed in white, covered in her lover's bl*od, running through the cornfields, screaming for her life. (All the students look at each other.) And the moral of the story is? Do not fall in love, especially with your brother's girl. (He cuts a glance at Elena, who rolls her eyes, knowing what he's talking about.) All right, kids. You have a fun night tonight. Be safe."
39445,Elena," You know, that cautionary tale would have had more of an impact on me about two weeks ago."
39446,Alaric," Damon may be gone, but I can still find pleasure in judging his life choices. Speaking of which, have you changed your mind about me compelling you to forget about him yet?"
39447,Elena," Why do you say, ""yet,"" as if I'm gonna wake up one day and realize that my life is over if I don't have the traumatic memories of loving a serial k*ll?"
39448,Alaric, Had to ask.
39449,Elena," You know, maybe you're right. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, or maybe I got a very valuable piece of advice from myself about how to be happy and I intend on taking it. Am I gonna see you at the party tonight?"
39450,Alaric," You know, I'm waiting on the mixer for thirtysomething vampires just back from the dead. Less of a crowd."
39451,Elena," Come on, Ric. You are like one hoodie and 3 missed haircuts away from becoming Professor Shane."
39452,Alaric," I am perfectly content staying at home, letting my hair grow out."
39453,Elena, You're hiding. You're becoming a self-loathing vampire hermit. Tell you what. You've been given the chance to start over. Take it. Be happy.
39454,Alaric, I am happy... ish.
39455,Elena, Exactly. I'll see you at 8: 00 but not in that t-shirt. You've worn it twice this week.
39456,Elena (pumping her fist)," There you are, good."
39457,Elena, Are you going out tonight?
39458,Liam, On the friday of homecoming weekend? No. I'm studying.
39459,Elena, Sarcasm. What an unexpected response. I think you should come to the corn maze with me.
39460,Liam, A corn maze?
39461,Elena, Mm-hmm.
39462,Liam, Will Dorothy and Toto be joining us?
39463,Elena," Hilarious. You know, there's an actual scientific word for why people go to these invents."
39464,Liam, And what's that?
39465,Elena, Fun. (She stops walking and turns to him.) Do you feel like having some with me?
39466,Liam, That depends. Are you gonna try and set me up with any more of your friends?
39467,Elena, That depends. Are you gonna kiss me out of the blue again?
39468,Liam, Not when you say it like that.
39469,Elena, I got to go. More people to invite.
39470,Liam, You're inviting multiple people to be your date tonight.
39471,Elena," I'm inviting multiple people to join in on the fun. As for who my date will be, well, that depends on you."
39472,Bonnie, You're in a good mood for the first time this decade. (Damon pokes her with the stick.) Stop that.
39473,Damon, Because I have a hot date with my girl tonight.
39474,Bonnie (quickly)," Yeah, assuming Kai's telling the truth."
39475,Damon," I'm thinking dinner and a movie, you know what? Screw the dinner and a movie. Skip straight to the good part.(Damon pokes her again and she jumps a bit.)"
39476,Bonnie," Yeah. And assuming I can do the spell, which I won't know...until I see it."
39477,Damon," Whatever happened to hope, Bon? 'Member when I was all like boo, grr? (Bonnie looks over to him. Damon uses a high-pitched tone to mimic Bonnie): And you were like ""hooray, hooray. We're getting out of here!""?"
39478,Bonnie," Look, I want to go home more than anything but Kai's a sociopath, who's to say he won't screw us over?"
39479,Damon (wearing a piercing gaze)," Me, I say, because I will k*ll Kai and anyone... (Damon does a playful jumping stance with the stick) ...who comes in the way of me going home."
39480,Kai (wearing that bland smile)," I heard my name. All good I hope. (He also has the ascendant in his hand and he uses it as he looks up and blocks the sun from his face with it.) The eclipse will happen directly overhead. (Kai looks at Damon and Bonnie who are sh**ting him glares.) In perfect alignment with the Gemini constellation. (He looks toward Damon, who looks right back, angrily.) You, need to dig into the tunnels below us."
39481,Bonnie (confused), Why?
39482,Kai (pausing a second and speaking to her slowly as if she were a young child), Have you never portal jumped through an eclipse before?
39483,Kai," Okay look, the light of the eclipse will shine down and activate the ascendant, you spout a little witchy woo and then poof! (He gestures an expl*si*n with his hands, Bonnie raises her eyebrows.) Anyone standing in the circle of light holding the ascendant goes home."
39484,Bonnie," By 'witchy woo', I assume you mean the spell?"
39485,Kai, Uh-huh.
39486,Bonnie (scrunching her eyebrows like she always does), Let me see it.
39487,Kai (pauses), When the time comes.
39488,Damon (slowly turning to look), Where are you going?
39489,Kai (smiling)," Into town, I need to..gather some important supplies."
39490,Ivy, What do you think?
39491,Caroline (now holding a bl*od bag)," I think you're wearing my dress. And you must be deaf because I already said. The. Party's. Not. Happening. (She tosses the bag to Ivy, who catches it.)"
39492,Ivy, So you'd rather be looked in a dorm room with a newbie vampire?
39493,Caroline, No. I would rather be at the party (she swings her head) just like I'd rather have friends who didn't ignore me for months and then use me when they need help.
39494,Ivy (pulling the bloodbag free of her mouth), Whoa. Just realized why Stefan brought me here to learn control. (she sits on Elena's bed) Just do yourself a favor. Unwind. Just admit you have a thing for him. (She brings the bloodbag to her mouth again.)
39495,Caroline (sitting up on the bed while jabbing a finger at Ivy), Excuse me?
39496,Ivy (tilts her head), I saw the way you looked at him that night you came over for dinner. (Caroline scoffs) You practically cut his food for him...
39497,Caroline," Oh, you kn... (she says quickly) My relationship with Stefan is strictly... c-complicated. Okay, aren't you supposed to be practicing your vamping or something?"
39498,Ivy," Done. See? I'm fine, you already put your number into my phone as my emergency vampire contact. I know I burn in the sun, we covered compulsion and snatch, eat, erase. (She looks at the window.) Look, it's getting dark. Let's go party. You can teach me how to eat someone without k*ll them."
39499,Caroline," Stefan will be here very soon, and then you can do whatever you want... WITH HIM."
39500,Ivy, Can we at least play a board game or do something non-vampire related.
39501,Caroline (impressed)," Finally, a good idea. (She stands and heads for the cabinet. What kind of game do you want to play?"
39502,Ivy," I don't know, scrabble?"
39503,Caroline (oblivious to the fact that Ivy is standing right behind her)," I have tournament, classic, and travel-sized.(Ivy's hands twine around Caroline's neck and snaps it, Caroline falls to the ground and Ivy speeds out of the dorm.)"
39504,Liam (looking at something behind her), What's doctor Laughlin doing here? Looking hot.
39505,Liam, I thought the lab coat was permanently attached.
39506,"Elena (smiling mischievously, turns back to Liam)"," I invited her. (she leans forward, scrunching her nose secretly) It's kind of a setup, only neither party knows about it."
39507,Elena, Come on. (She uses a country accent.) It's time to get your Kansas on.
39508,Caroline (while walking)," Stefan, hey. This is the third message alerting you that your psychotic little she-vamp has gone AWOL, and if you hadn't noticed, it's dark outside, so every dead sorority girl tonight is officially on you."
39509,Stefan," Grading on the curve, huh?"
39510,Alaric, You know this barely makes a dent. (He's staring at the Bourbon.)
39511,Alaric," Can't fault me for trying, though. You want some? (He looks up at Stefan.)"
39512,Stefan (stepping further into the classroom)," No, I just...came here to get one of these from Luke. (He holds up a daylight ring.)"
39513,Alaric (placing the Bourbon on the floor)," Let me guess... You played the 'Damon is dead, and it's all your fault,' card."
39514,Alaric (angry at Stefan)," What do you want, Stefan?"
39515,Stefan (steps further more into the room), Enzo turned a vampire when he and Caroline found me.
39516,Alaric (sitting down his pen)," You mean your girlfriend, from Savannah. (Alaric stands, walking over to Stefan.) The one you falsely led me to believe was a witch who knew how to help Damon and Bonnie?"
39517,Stefan," (sighs) Her name is Ivy. I was hoping you can compel her to get a handle on things, get somewhere far away from me, live a good life."
39518,Alaric (leaning his head forward), Are you asking me to help you with a break up?
39519,Stefan, I'm just asking you to give her a fresh start.
39520,Alaric, You mean give you a fresh start.
39521,Alaric," Sorry, Stefan. It's not that easy-"
39522,Stefan, Well it was when you compelled Elena to forget about Damon.
39523,Alaric," Well you forgot about him first, pal. (Alaric turns away.)"
39524,Stefan, He was my brother.
39525,Alaric (turning back to him)," Yeah, and he was my best friend....Why don't you get out of my face before I compel you to be the guy I used to know instead?"
39526,Man, He takes a breath: You scared me. (But he's smiling.)
39527,Ivy, Really? That wasn't scary...(Her tone changes.) But this is.
39528,Ivy," I snatched, I ate, now...ERASE!"
39529,v*ctim, Erase what? What the hell are you doing to me?
39530,Ivy," I-I don't think I did it right. (She's breathing deeply.) And I'm still hungry. Oh god, I am totally going to k*ll you, uh. (She looks directly in his eyes.) You should GO, RUN, SERIOUSLY!"
39531,Ivy, I suck at this.
39532,Bonnie, Hey.
39533,Bonnie," You know there's a very probable chance you're digging your own grave, and...not bothered?"
39534,Damon, Ha.
39535,Kai, Looks like I got back just in time.
39536,Damon," Zima, grunge, every Alex Rodriguez rookie card in demand, and a pager. Really? (Damon drops the bag on the ground.)"
39537,Kai,"  555-Hiya-Kai, no way I'm giving those digits up."
39538,Damon, These are the important supplies you needed to get?
39539,Kai," Look. The future sound great, all right? I'm superexcited about the Internet, but 1994 has been my home for most of my life. I'd hate to get homesick. So let's get down there..."
39540,Bonnie (standing)," No. (She walks forward, pushing Damon out of the way, who attempted to stop her.) We are not going anywhere until you show me the spell."
39541,Kai, Okay.
39542,Damon, Are we literally not going anywhere?
39543,Bonnie (pursing her lips)," Fine, you don't want to show me the spell? Then you can do it yourself."
39544,Bonnie, You...want my magic. (She holds out her arm.) Take it.
39545,Kai (looking up at Damon)," Uh-oh, she's being brave."
39546,Bonnie," I'm serious Kai! This was your big threat, wasn't it? If I do the spell and let us out of here, you'll just take my magic, leave me for dead, and do the spell yourself. So go ahead. Take all of it. (Damon looks worried, and Kai looks down at Bonnie.)"
39547,Kai, *sighing* Don't mind if I do.
39548,Damon, Bonnie?
39549,Bonnie (managing to speak)," It's okay, he won't k*ll me."
39550,Damon, Doesn't look like that from here.
39551,Bonnie, OW.
39552,Damon (extremely worried), Hey! Bonnie.
39553,Damon," Whoa, hey, guys. (And when they continue.): STOP."
39554,Bonnie (trying to catch her breath and when she finally does)," He doesn't..know the spell. Which means, we don't need him. (She raises her hand.) Motus."
39555,Damon," NO! No, BONNIE?"
39556,Damon (turning away)," Great work, Bonnie."
39557,Elena," Oh, I think I recognize this scarecrow. (She points at one.)"
39558,Liam, You said that about...every scarecrow.
39559,Elena," Okay, well then, we are officially lost."
39560,Liam," Actually, it's two lefts and three rights. I pulled up a satellite image of this maze before I came."
39561,Elena (tilting her head), Oh. Competitive type. Got it.
39562,Liam (smiling)," Question is, am I your type?"
39563,Elena (widening her mouth)," Honestly, no..."
39564,Elena," But people can change, right?"
39565,Liam (stops walking), Uh-oh.
39566,Elena (turning with a smile), What?
39567,Liam, You're still hung up on your ex.
39568,Liam," Overly ambitious premed student, desperate to become a doctor so she can prove to the guy who dumped her that he messed up big time."
39569,Elena (impassively and nonchalantly)," Actually, he died."
39570,Liam (eyes widen)," Or that. I'm... I'm sorry, I thought Stefan was..."
39571,Elena (quickly), No.
39572,Liam (looking down), Yikes.
39573,Elena (scrunching up her face)," Yeah. It's ok, it's ok. (She takes a long breath.) His name was Damon, but... tonight isn't about him, it's about you and me."
39574,Jo," Ahh, NOT COOL!"
39575,Alaric (sees her and walks over)," Heh, heh."
39576,Jo," Oh, Professor Bourbon. Perfect timing."
39577,Alaric, Imagine you see a lot worse in E.R.
39578,Jo," Everything I see there is natural, gross but natural. Zombies, ghosts, the undead...not cool."
39579,Alaric (making a face)," Good to know. (He takes a breath.) You haven't seen Elena around here, have you? She...basically blackmailed me into coming tonight."
39580,Jo," Oh, let me guess, she told you to get out of the classroom, live a little? Yeah..."
39581,Alaric, We're being set up. Ok.
39582,Jo," Now why don't you be a gentleman and get me the hell out of here because we are way too old for this party, and I need a drink stat."
39583,Jo (accepting it), I thought you were a germaphobe.
39584,Alaric, I'll make an exception.
39585,Elena," See, I told you it would be fun."
39586,Alaric, Speak of the devil.
39587,Tyler, Oh god.
39588,Man, Help.
39589,Liam, Elena! (When she doesn't answer: Elena! Get over here!
39590,Elena," Oh god, h-ho-how bad is it?"
39591,Elena, I got this.
39592,Liam, I'm not sure there's anything you can do.
39593,Elena," I'll do everything that I can, j-just go see if you can help someone else, alright?"
39594,Elena, Come on. GO.
39595,Elena (eyes up close on the screen)," Listen to me, you dove out of the way just in time. You were very lucky. Now get out of here and take as many people as you can, ok? Come on."
39596,Elena, Tyler?
39597,Tyler," I was driving the truck, Elena."
39598,Elena, What?
39599,Tyler," This guy ran right in front of me, and he's hurt bad. If he dies, I'm a werewolf all over again, ok? I need you to get here. We're in a ditch. (He speaks while staring around.) I don't know where, but I need you here now, so please hurry."
39600,Elena (quickly and squeakily)," Tyler you don't understand, you drove right through the maze, there are injured people everywhere. "
39601,Tyler (pauses for a second), What the hell am I supposed to do?
39602,Elena (looking around)," Ah, Just... listen. Just hang on. Um, make sure that you keep him awake. Assess his injuries while I go find Jo and Alaric."
39603,CORN MAZE, 
39604,Jo, You're bleeding.
39605,Alaric, I'm fine.
39606,Jo (crawling over)," No, you're not. Let me see. (She raises his shirt and sees that there is no wound, she looks momentarily confused.): Wait, how the hell...?"
39607,Alaric, I don't think It's my bl*od.
39608,Jo, Oh. Ok. That's gonna make things more difficult.
39609,Alaric, I really think I should get you out of here.
39610,Jo, No. That's not an option. (She grabs a random strip of material and wraps her arm in it.) You look pale. Does bl*od make you squeamish?
39611,Alaric, Yeah. Something like that.
39612,Jo," Don't worry. You'll get used to it. Call 911, follow me."
39613,Alaric, Ok.
39614,Caroline, THANK GOD!
39615,Stefan (rushing forward), You lost her?
39616,Caroline," Oh, so you decided to listen to your messages a million hours later? No, I didn't lose her, she snapped my neck and what the hell took you so long?"
39617,Stefan, I got caught up.
39618,Caroline, You got caught up doing what?
39619,Stefan (a little guilty), Driving halfway out of town.
39620,Caroline (pauses), You were leaving?
39621,Stefan (looks down for a second), I slid Ivy's daylight right under...
39622,Caroline, No.
39623,Stefan, ...your front door...
39624,Caroline," No, I don't care about some stupid ring, Stefan! Were you seriously about to dump your vampire ex-girlfriend onto my lap, and then just skip town?"
39625,Caroline," God, who are you right now?!"
39626,Stefan (raising his voice)," I'm someone who's trying to start over, and then suddenly you and Enzo show up and now I have hunters on my trail and a brand new vampire who wants to k*ll me and everyone else in her path! And that's not how someone starts over, Caroline!"
39627,Caroline (after a while in a more serene tone)," You know what the worst part about all of this is? Is about a month ago, I wished that Damon would come back. Because I knew if that happened, that I'd get you back too. But right now, all I want is for you to just..get back in your car, and go."
39628,Caroline, Where are you?
39629,Ivy, I did a really bad thing.
39630,Caroline," Oh, you mean, break my neck? Yeah, I noticed."
39631,Ivy," Okay, two bad things. Look, I'm sorry-"
39632,Caroline," (sighs) Tell me exactly where you are and stay put, I'll come get you."
39633,Damon, Mmm.
39634,Damon," Mmm, mm, MM."
39635,Bonnie, Can you... stop. Let me concentrate?
39636,Damon (staring at the bottle)," On the bright side, this stuff's not so bad. (Bonnie sighs, annoyed) It's fruity, and fizzy."
39637,Bonnie," Damon, I'm working on something..."
39638,Damon," On the not-so-bright side, is your intelligence, because you took the only chance of us getting out of here and turned him into a giant....douche-kebab. (He drinks up.)"
39639,Bonnie," Think about it, Damon. What prison gives an inmate a key?"
39640,Damon, Is that a trick question?
39641,Damon," Or is this stuff actually starting to kick in,"
39642,Bonnie," I think the Gemini coven used a Bennett spell to create this place, what if that's why my Grams sent me here?"
39643,Damon (pointing at his face), This is the face I make when I don't understand you. (he goes cross-eyed and purses his lips)
39644,Bonnie (rolling her eyes and sighing)," You know the last thing my Grams said to me..was to stay strong.....what if that was her way of telling me I have the power to get out? (Damon chugs some more) I have the ascendant, a massive celestial event to draw from, plus a burning desire to get away from you. (she points the ascendant at him)"
39645,Bonnie,  [Chanting a spell that I can't type down.]
39646,Bonnie, [Repeating the spell I can't type down.] 
39647,Bonnie," That's why Kai wouldn't k*ll me. He needed a Bennett,...I was his only way out of here."
39648,Damon (slack-jawed)," Whoa, where are you going?"
39649,Bonnie (climbing towards the hole Damon had dug open), Home. Coming?
39650,Liv (after a moment of taking in the scene), What happened?
39651,Tyler (sweating and disheveled), I hit this kid in the road.
39652,Tyler," Look, it wasn't my fault. It was an accident."
39653,Liv (after stuttering)," That's a good thing, right?"
39654,Liv, You know what I mean.
39655,Tyler," It doesn't matter. If he dies, I'm...(He shakes his head in disbelief.) Call Elena."
39656,Alaric," Ambulance is on the way,"
39657,Jo (from the ground), Good.
39658,Jo," Get over here, I need your hands. (She grabs Alaric's hands and places them on the wound.) Put your fingers right there, that should stop the bleeding.)"
39659,Jo, While I get a look at the rest of em'.
39660,Jo, You doing okay?
39661,Alaric (looking away from her)," Yeah, I'm fine. Wow."
39662,Jo, Just keep your finger on that femoral artery.
39663,Alaric, Ok.
39664,Jo, His pulse is still dropping.
39665,Alaric, This isn't your first rodeo?
39666,Jo (still helping the injured man)," Listen, I was in the army right out of med school. Family stuff. Just had to get away."
39667,Elena," Dr. Laughlin, my friend Tyler, he's in trouble, and its sounds really bad, and... I don't know where he is."
39668,Jo, Call me Jo. Put him on speaker.
39669,(Elena does so.), Ok.
39670,Jo (voiceover), Tyler can you hear me?
39671,Tyler ((freaking out))," I-I don't know what to do, I think he's losing consciousness."
39672,Jo," Need you to answer my questions as accurately as you can, is there bl*od?"
39673,Liv, Tons.
39674,Jo," Is it still flowing, is he bleeding now?"
39675,Tyler (hoarsely), No. No. I... it looks like it stopped.
39676,Jo," Is there any coming out of his nose, or his mouth?"
39677,Tyler, Yes.
39678,Jo," What color is it? Is it red, or is it black?"
39679,Liv, It's black. It's really freaking black. What do we do?
39680,Jo, Take his hand.
39681,Liv, Now what?
39682,Jo, Just try and keep him comfortable.....Won't be long now.
39683,Bonnie (in a soft whisper)," Okay...(She looks up at Damon, who's staring.)"
39684,Bonnie," It's time, Damon."
39685,Damon," Alright... (he walks over to Bonnie, under the direct light of the eclipse) ...let's get awkward."
39686,Damon, Like this?
39687,Bonnie (slightly-nervously), Yep.
39688,"Damon (looks up at Bonnie, his eyes a brilliant blue)", (sighs) I'm sure there are about a billion people you'd rather be here with.
39689,(Bonnie smiles.), Not exactly.
39690,Bonnie, Let's go... AH!
39691,Kai, Forgetting someone?
39692,Kai, Did you really think I hadn't tried to k*ll myself before?
39693,Kai," Because I had... (he reloads his crossbow) ...lots of times, lots of ways."
39694,Kai (about the ascendant)," Grab that, and the next arrow goes in her heart. Your choice."
39695,Damon (whispering)," Okay, I got ya..."
39696,Bonnie," DAMON, NO!"
39697,Tyler," Come on, man. Please, you gotta live. Come on, buddy. Come on."
39698,Tyler," Come on, man. You can't die!"
39699,Liv," Stop! Tyler, stop! (She rushes over and pulls him away.) Just stop, okay? There's nothing you can do."
39700,Tyler, i k*ll him.
39701,Liv," No, you didn't."
39702,Tyler (as Liv slowly sits in front of the almost-dead man)," Yes, I did, Liv. Everything we've tried to do to keep me from this, and all it took was one guy running out into the road."
39703,"(Suddenly Liv's hands sh**t forward and cover the v*ctim's nose, and mouth and the guy obviously can't breathe.) Tyler"," WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LIV, LIV STOP! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?"
39704,Liv, You didn't k*ll him Tyler. (She looks up at him.) I did.
39705,Elena, Hey. The ambulances have arrived. Jo said to let the paramedics take it from here.
39706,Liam, I don't think she can wait.
39707,Elena," Her windpipe, it's..."
39708,Liam," Deviated is the medical term. Screwed is more like it. Either way, she's not getting enough air."
39709,Elena (softly)," Liam, I can help."
39710,Liam, Good. Stabilize her head while I trache her.
39711,Elena, Have you ever done this before?
39712,Liam, Practiced on a grapefruit. Didn't end well. (He has a pen in his hand.)
39713,Elena," No, Liam. That's not what I meant. I can actually... (She's ready to bite into her wrist when Liam stabs the girl in the neck with the pen, the girl gasps and begins to breathe.)"
39714,Elena, It worked. You actually did it. (She smiles at him.)
39715,Liam (breathing deeply), Don't sound so surprised.
39716,Damon (grunting), Bonnie...get...out of here.
39717,Bonnie (tears in her eyes), I'm not going to make it.
39718,Bonnie (bravely), But you are.
39719,Bonnie (holds her hand out), Motus... (she chants.)
39720,Kai, DON'T!
39721,Damon (desperate to save bonnie), NO.
39722,Damon, NO!
39723,Alaric, How you feeling?
39724,Jo, You really want to know? Because I'm hopped up on pain meds and just obnoxious enough to tell you.
39725,Alaric (smirks), I'll take my chances.
39726,Jo (laughs)," I think you're great. You're brave, funny, not to mention maybe the most attractive man I've ever seen, and I feel completely comfortable telling you this because I'm old enough to know what I want. And call me crazy, but I think I was meant to know you."
39727,Jo, This is the part where you say something or kiss me or run for the hills.
39728,Alaric," Yeah, I, um. I think you're amazing, brilliant, and one of the sexiest women I have ever met, and I would love to believe that you and I were meant to be because I would love to believe there was a plan for me other than this life that I am living right now."
39729,Alaric," But tonight was a disaster. You thought I was boring and a borderline alcoholic, and because you don't know me, not the real me anyway, you don't want to kiss me, and you absolutely want me to run for the hills."
39730,"Jo (blinks, taking a breath)"," You're right, tonight was a literal disaster, and you're definitely an alcoholic...(She leans forward, grabbing him and kissing him softly, and when they pull away, she says: But you're far from boring, Ric."
39731,Ivy, Where are you? I have been standing here for a hundred years.
39732,Caroline (voiceover)," Don't exaggerate, I'm almost there."
39733,Tripp, Need any help?
39734,Tripp," I heard about the, uh, big campus accident on my scanner. Sounds like some people got hurt or something."
39735,Ivy, I'm fine.
39736,Tripp (still walking toward her)," Actually, you're bleeding, you might be in shock."
39737,Ivy (her head still turned), Please. Just. Go.
39738,Tripp (reaching out for her shoulder), I don't think...
39739,Liam," So that girl dressed like lady Whitmore, I was ready to give up on her, and you were able to save her. How?"
39740,Elena, I don't know. Beginner's luck?
39741,Liam," Elena, she should have died."
39742,Elena," And she didn't. There are crazy, mysterious things in the world, I mean, some things science can't explain."
39743,Liam, Name one.
39744,Elena (stopping and turning to him), Ok. Um...Why does a baby take its first breath?
39745,Liam (shrugging), A reflex. The fluid in a newborn's lungs are...
39746,Liam, I thought kissing me was a fate worse then death.
39747,Elena (smiling)," You asked me what my type is. You were a hero tonight, an absolutely jaw-dropping and out-of-this-world hero. That's my type."
39748,Liv, We're closed.
39749,Tyler, I talked to Elena.
39750,Liv, Still closed.
39751,Tyler, She said everyone else lived. (Tyler slowly walks toward her.) You don't want to talk about what happened?
39752,Liv, I've got nothing to say.
39753,Tyler," You k*ll someone tonight. (Liv has her back turned to him, and her eyes are watery) You can't just pretend that didn't happen."
39754,Liv, Watch me.
39755,Tyler (tilting his head)," Liv. (She doesn't answer so he approaches her.) Liv. He was dead. There was nothing you could have done to save him, so you saved me instead. (He reaches over and takes her hand.) You. Saved. Me. I can never repay you for that. All I can do is promise you that I won't waste it."
39756,THE SALVATORE CRYPT, 
39757,Stefan (looking around), Ahh.
39758,Stefan, Yep... This is happening. I'm gonna talk out loud to a... A crypt filled with my dead family.
39759,Stefan," Everyone but you, Damon. Because wherever you are, it's not here."
39760,"(He takes a seat on a small bench.) Stefan, looking down"," I got to say...I'm not doing so great...without you. I keep trying to start over, but... I can't get anywhere..."
39761,Stefan," Because I'm lost, brother, I'm lost."
39762,Damon (using his snarky tone)," So what? Gone a couple of months, you think it's okay to waste a perfectly good bottle of Bourbon?"
39763,Damon, Ahh.
39764,Stefan (in a soft whisper), Damon?
39765,Damon, Yep. (He pops the 'p'.) In the flesh.
39766,Stefan (slowly and whispery), How am I seeing you right now?
39767,Damon," Because I'm not dead, Stefan (he looks down at the bourbon) I mean, this stuff's good, but it's not ""I see dead people"" good. Heh."
39768,Damon," Heh. It's a hell of a long story, brother, but....I'm back. I'm back."
39769,Damon (nods at Stefan), (whispers) Yeah.
39770,Damon," I'm back, Stefan..."
39771,Elena, Damon is gone.
39772,Tripp, Vampires m*rder my wife.
39773,Stefan," Not doing so great, Damon. I'm lost, brother. It's kind of a long story, brother, but I'm back."
39774,Ivy, Please just let me go!
39775,Tripp, I know this may seem a little barbaric. (he says calmly as she cries desperately pulling on the chains) I promise you it's nothing personal. (the other two vampires in the back also try to get free).
39776,Ivy, Why are you doing this?
39777,Tripp," It's a longer story then we have time for but trust me you don't want this life. If you even call it that. (He says, turning up the radio)"
39778,Ivy," Come on, come on. (she pulls at the chains) Come on, come on! (they loosen, but she runs out of time)"
39779,Ivy, (panicked) What is heappening? (She screams in horror) What is happening!?
39780,Damon, I missed you too buddy.
39781,Stefan, I can't believe it. (they pull apart) I thought you were gone.
39782,Damon, Well you didn't think I was gone-gone. I promised you an eternity of misery. Heh. (he smiles)
39783,Elena, He's back? (Caroline nods) How? (she asks confused)
39784,Caroline," I don't know, honestly everything Stefan said after ""Damon's back"" is kind of a blur."
39785,Elena, What about Bonnie? (She asks hopeful)
39786,Damon, She sacrificed herself so I could come back but I don't want anyone to know. No sense making this harder than it already is.
39787,Stefan, What are we going to tell people?
39788,Caroline, (quietly) He said she wasn't over there.
39789,Elena, Where is there exactly?
39790,Stefan, (confused) Mystic Falls? 1994?
39791,Damon, I know. A bunch of witches were going to get together and create some space time purgatory you'd think they'd pick a better year than the one Kurt Cobain k*ll himself in. The whole thing was just very depressing. (he takes a swig from the bottle of Bourbon). 
39792,Stefan, So how did you get back?
39793,Damon," Long story, big flash of light. Two decades worth of jet lag. I will explain all of my adventures in that flannel hellscape, but first, there's someone I got to go see. (he says grasping Stefan's shoulders then walks past him). "
39794,Elena, I don't want to see him.
39795,Alaric," (sigh) I get it, but that's how you feel now, Elena. If you thought there was even a chance you'd see Damon again you would have never asked me to compel away your memories of loving him."
39796,Damon, She did what?
39797,Stefan, She had Alaric do it.
39798,Alaric, DAMON IS GOING TO k*ll ME! (he yells)
39799,Elena, You're k*ll. (she replies calmly)
39800,Alaric, Doesn't mean he won't try.
39801,Elena, What do you think is going to happen when I do see him?
39802,Damon," I just need to see her Stefan. Our eyes will meet, fireworks will go off, and the balance of nature will be restored. She loves me!"
39803,Elena, He's a psychotic k*ll!
39804,Alaric, You only feel that way because I erased all the good parts.
39805,Elena, I don't see anything that could balance out the bad. Promise me you won't lift the compulsion. (Alaric sighs) Promise me!
39806,Alaric," I won't, Ok, not until you ask me to."
39807,Elena, Thank you.
39808,Alaric," But, Elena, I hope you ask me."
39809,Elena, I have to go. I have a shift at the hospital.
39810,Alaric, Since when?
39811,Elena, Since Damon came back and I'm trying desperately to avoid him.
39812,Alaric," Fine, but if you're avoiding people, add Jo to your list. (Elena looks at him confused) I compelled her to forget our date the other night and it didn't take."
39813,Elena, What do you mean it didn't take?
39814,Alaric," Well, either she's on Vervain or there's some other reason, but she can't be compelled. So see if you can find out why."
39815,Elena, Ok. Yeah. I will. Will you call Jeremy? I had to tell him about Bonnie over the phone. You can imagine how that went.
39816,Sarah, Where are you going?
39817,Jeremy, Out. (he replies coldly walking past her)
39818,Sarah, You promised me you'd help me track down my relatives.
39819,Jeremy, Just...later...Ok.
39820,Sarah," Jeremy, you can't just say, ""Zach Salvatore was your dad too bad he's dead"" and then, ""peace out."""
39821,Jeremy, I can't do this right now!
39822,Sarah," What is so urgent to make you finally unglue your ass from the couch? I know it's not school. It's not work. If it's another girl, I'd shower first."
39823,Jeremy, I just need to get out of here. (he leaves)
39824,Enzo, Oh Tripp's errand boy returns.
39825,Matt," Ooh, my bad."
39826,Enzo," Heh. That's all right, mate. Just lean in and I'll take it right from the tap. (Matt hands him the glass to which Enzo drinks)"
39827,Matt, I'll pass.
39828,Enzo, Yeah come on I'm gonna need my strength back for when you help me escape.
39829,Matt, Sorry. If Stefan turned you in I'm guessing you deserved it.
39830,Enzo," When did Stefan's moral compass become the new true north? Wasn't he the one who scurried off to some poxy, little town while he let everyone believe he was still searching for his brother? Not exactly the hero move, if you ask me."
39831,Matt, Still I think the general population is safer with you in here.
39832,Enzo," Yeah. Probably right, well except for Elena...Stefan, Caroline, You. Whatdo you think would happen if I were to tell your boss about known vampires and their...groupies?"
39833,Tripp," Well, Savannah was a waste of gas. Minus a few bl*od bags, the house you told us about was empty."
39834,Enzo, Odd. Must have smelled you coming.
39835,Tripp," Hmm, would have been a total bust, except I happened upon a girl that fit the description that you gave me. That was near Whitmore. 500 miles from where you said she was gonna be. (He pulls out a phone and shows Enzo a photo of a girl) Is this Ivy?"
39836,Enzo, That's the one.
39837,Tripp," So I give you today to conjure up the location of your vampire friends, or you and I are gonna go sightseeing in Mystic Falls. (He leaves and Enzo glares at Matt; Matt turns away from Enzo following Tripp out, closing the door behind him). "
39838,Caroline, Why didn't you tell us Enzo has been locked up this whole time?
39839,Matt," Honestly, I didn't know anybody was missing him."
39840,Caroline, Matt!
39841,Matt, I'm sorry! I was confused about which vampires we like and which ones we don't!
39842,Caroline," Ok. Well, what about Ivy? Is she there, too?"
39843,Matt, Tripp drove her and two others across the border last night.
39844,Caroline," (sigh) Oh, God."
39845,Alaric, Well do you know where Tripp is now. (Caroline sits down next to Matt)
39846,Matt, He's running down another lead but he didn't tell me what it was.
39847,Alaric, Well can you find out? We need to know who his next target is.
39848,Matt, If Enzo talks it'll be you guys.
39849,Caroline," Well that's not going to happen because we're busting him out, right, and if for no other reason than so I can kick his ass for getting caught in the first place."
39850,Alaric, You have any idea how he managed to get his hands on him? (Stefan enters the office)
39851,Stefan," He didn't. I turned him in. (Caroline and Alaric stare at Stefan, disbelieving)"
39852,Elena, Who is it? (she asks with her hand on the door knob)
39853,Damon," (he says softly, she immediately pulls her hand away stopping herself from opening the door) I just wanted to talk. (we see Damon on the other side of the door)"
39854,Elena," I can't, not now."
39855,Damon, (sigh) Look. I know why you did what you did. It's not real. You know what's real? The way you felt for me. You once told me it was the most real thing you ever felt in your life.
39856,Elena, Those feelings are gone.
39857,Damon," Oh, come on, Elena. You've compelled enough people to know it's just a way of covering the truth and no matter how badly you want it done, it doesn't make it any less of a lie, you know. (She slowly reaches for the door knob) Oh, I hear you breathing. (she gasps, pulling away) You have no idea how long I've wanted to hear you breathe. (She sighs and puts her hand on the door, from Damon's side he loops up and copies this motion putting his hand where her hand is) Just open the door, Elena. Everything can go back to the way it was. (She pulls her hand away and he jiggles the door knob) Just...(sigh, he leans his head against the door) Just open the door, Elena, please...or, at the very least, step aside because I'm gonna kick this door in. (She unlocks the door, Damon hears it click. He turns the knob, she stands there for a moment but by the time he pushes the door open she has vamp sped out the window. He looks around to an empty room and the white curtains blowing in the breeze). "
39858,Stefan, You seriously jumped out of a window? What if somebody saw you?
39859,Elena," I know, I know. I panicked. I don't know. (she says pacing back and forth in the hospital hallway)"
39860,Stefan, Look. He's been trapped over there alone for months. He just wants to see you.
39861,Elena," Look. I get how I'm supposed to feel, but I know how I actually feel and I'm happy now. What if I look at him and my old feelings break through the compulsion."
39862,Stefan," Well, they won't, but even if they did, is that such a bad thing?"
39863,Elena," (sigh) Yeah. I started over just like you did, Ok? I made a smart choice for myself and for my future. Stefan, I kissed Liam last night."
39864,Stefan," (groans) Oh, please forget that you told me that and definitly do not tell Damon that."
39865,Elena, Becuase he's gonna k*ll him right just like he k*ll my brother!
39866,Stefan," I was gonna say becuase he'll be heartbroken. Listen what do you want to do? I mean, you have to see him eventually."
39867,Elena," I know, but I just don't think eventually can be today, all right? (Elena spots Jo walking forward and putting her cup of coffee on a cart just outside a hospital room) I'm not...I'm just not..ready. (Jo looks at some X-Rays and then enters the room) I got to go. (she hangs up, shoves the phone in her pocket and quickly walks toward the cart, lifting the lid off the coffee she drinks it quickly; surprised that there is no Vervain in it. Jo comes out of the room and Elena quickly puts the coffee back). "
39868,Jo, Elena.
39869,Elena, Hey.
39870,Jo, I didn't think you were here today.
39871,Elena, Yeah. No. I changed my schedule around.
39872,Jo, (sipping her coffee) Okay. Follow me.
39873,Matt, (surprised) Sarah? What are you doing?
39874,Sarah, Could ask you the same question.
39875,Matt, (closing the computer lid) You can't be in here.
39876,Sarah," From the look on your face you're downloading p*rn or you're not supposed to be here, either. What are you doing in Tripp's office?"
39877,Matt, What do you want?
39878,Sarah, Information on some people who used to live here. (she says looking at some of the cabinets) You know anything about the Salvatore's?
39879,Matt, Not really.
39880,Sarah," Well, according to Jeremy, Zach Salvatore was my dad. (Matt is surprised). He supposedly died from an animal attack, and coincidentally so did my mom but I've been paying attention. I know what that's code for, and your boss seems to know a lot about homicidal wildlife, so..."
39881,Matt, So you thought breaking in here was a good idea.
39882,Sarah," Guess we have that in common. Now, either you help me or start coming up with a good lie when I tell your boss you were snooping."
39883,Matt, Animal attacks are filed over there. (he says indicating a cabinet behind her)
39884,Damon," Professor Saltzman. What, you coudn't compel yourself a PH.D? (he asks, pouring a glass of Bourbon)"
39885,Alaric, I can't believe your back.
39886,Damon, I am...heh. (he slides the glass to Ric)
39887,Alaric, So...how the hell are you? (he asks sitting in the chair across from Damon)
39888,Damon," Well let's see Ric...I clawed my way out of some retro pocket universe only to find that I needed to compel myself a new change of clothes because this antimagic hamster ball is keeping me from going home, and then I find out that my best friend rather than doing anything about it decided that it was the best use of his time to compel my beautiful and lovely girlfriend to forget that she ever loved me...Heh...I'm great...Ric...Thanks for asking. (he says sarcastically and drinks his Bourbon)"
39889,Alaric," Look, Damon..."
39890,Damon," (cutting him off) I know she was a train wreck without me but a full mind erase, seriously?"
39891,Alaric," She loved you too much, and it was k*ll her."
39892,Damon," Well, I'm flattered, but I'm back, (he takes his feet off the desk quickly and leans toward Ric) so let's get this uncompulsion on the books huh."
39893,Alaric," Fine, as soon as Elena tells me that's what she wants."
39894,Damon," Right. Here's the thing she's not gonna want to be uncompelled (he gets up and walks toward Alaric) if she can't remember why she'd want to be uncompelled mmm-mmm chicken, egg. (he says holding his glass of Bourbon is one hand and nothing in the other, weighing the options)"
39895,Alaric," I know, and I'm sorry."
39896,Damon," Sorry? She won't even see me, Ric."
39897,Alaric," I get it, Damon but she's happy, and I'm not gonna take that away from her until she asks me to."
39898,Damon," It's not like I don't want Elena to be happy. (he says finishing his Bourbon) I just want her to be happy with me. (he says pointing to himself, but Alaric won't budge on the subject) Right. (He slams the glass down on the table and walks past Ric; stops then goes back for the bottle of Bourbon and leaves)"
39899,Stefan, Look Enzo wasn't being careful Tripp would've caught him eventually and that meant danger for all of us.
39900,Caroline, Right so you handed Enzo over so we wouldn't be targeted and now you're rescuing him so we won't be targeted. Way to go. (She says sarcastically)
39901,Stefan," Well, I thought Tripp was gonna k*ll him. I didn't think he was going to keep him alive for information."
39902,Caroline," Oh, Well, in that case, sounds like you were just being practical. So did you rat out Ivy, too?"
39903,Stefan, What?
39904,Caroline," Well, you didn't want to deal with her anymore, you wanted her gone, and now she is. You know what you really should write Tripp a thank-you note."
39905,Stefan," Hold on a second Enzo turns Ivy right, a hunter k*ll her and yet I'm the bad guy? I'm not the one threatening to turn in other vampires to save his own skin."
39906,Caroline, The only one who turned in other vampires is you Stefan. That's why you're helping. Guilt for getting Damon's friend captured.
39907,Stefan, Yeah. Damon is my brother and I gave up on him first. Enzo didn't so if rescuing his idiot friend is gonna somehow make it up to him that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
39908,Caroline," Great. Good for you. Let me know when you figure out how you're gonna make everything up to me. (She says as they arrive at Tripp's Cabin, Stefan's eyes widen as the door opens; he grabs Caroline and vamp speeds out of sight; hiding behind a crate in the yard)"
39909,Caroline," Let's get in there. (they get inside the cabin only to find it empty) Well, where the hell is he?"
39910,Elena, I like your bracelet. What is it made of? (she goes to touch it but Jo moves her hand away grabbing a chart and Elena pulls her hand back reaching behind her neck awkwardly)
39911,Jo," No idea, while you're here can I get your opinion on something?"
39912,Elena, Sure yeah.
39913,Jo," Female patient, blunt force trauma to the head, massive internal hemorrhaging, multiple bone fractures, (she says opening the door to a patient room) she was a v*ctim at the corn maze. (The room is empty)"
39914,Elena, Where is she?
39915,Jo, Probably Freshman Lit.
39916,Elena, I don't get it.
39917,Jo, Neither do I. See the patient was never admitted even with such extensive injuries. Liam said you treated her at the scene. That's a pretty good save for someone with half a semester of Pre-Med.
39918,Elena," Yeah you know uhm I think Liam was exaggerating how bad off she was. It was dark, and, yeah, there was a lot of bl*od..."
39919,Jo, (cutting her off) Don't! I know what Alaric is. I know what you are. If any more bl*od bags go missing. I know who to come to. (She closes the door and walks away leaving Elena there genuinely confused). 
39920,Damon," Well, somebody was thorough. (he drinks from the bottle of Bourbon and flips down the photo of Elena, Stefan and Caroline) No pictures of Damon anywhere. (he picks up the photo of Elena at her graduation) Huh? (he grabs a black sharpie off her desk and gets comfortable on her bed) Ooh. (he draws a stick figure of himself next to her) It's kind of creepy, you just standing there all hulky and brooding. (he says without looking up). "
39921,Jeremy," (in the doorway) Says the freak who's stalking my sister. (Damon finishes his stick figure with two eyes, a smile and two fangs sticking out)"
39922,Damon," Technically, I'm lying in wait."
39923,Jeremy, (coming in) Why didn't Bonnie come back? (Damon doesn't answer) Why didn't she come back?
39924,Damon, Because she wasn't there. It was just me.
39925,Jeremy, (sitting on the bext next to Damon) You know I paid her cell bill so I could call her phone and hear her say the same six words every day?
39926,Damon, Sounds good. I'll give it a call.
39927,Jeremy, Why? She hated you.
39928,Damon, Bonnie wasn't there with me Jeremy because she found peace. She's in a a better place.
39929,Elena, How did you know?
39930,Jo," Besides not believing that you closed a penetrating abdominal trauma without so much as a first aid kit? Pretty sure you weren't looking for stevia in my coffee. With Alaric I wasn't 100% sure he tried to compel me, but then I remembered I have really crappy luck my in my love life so of course my hot, new teacher crush would be a vampire."
39931,Elena, So what are you?
39932,Jo, Busy. If you want to stick around (she says walking past Elena) there's food trays on the third floor that need clearing.
39933,Elena, (following her) That's it? You're gonna let me stay?
39934,Jo, You saved that girl instead of feeding on her that's good enough for me.
39935,Elena," You're not even afraid, not even fazed for that matter. There's only one thing that can resist compulsion without needing Vergain, and that's a witch. (Jo nods slightly) You're a witch."
39936,Jo, How about I make you a deal. You don't ask questions about me and I won't ask questions about you.
39937,Elena, Deal.
39938,Jo," Oh and you can tell Alaric if he wants to avoid a complicated relationship, he doesn't have to hide behind compulsion to do it. (She says walking through a corridor, leaving Elena). "
39939,Sarah, Maybe it was a good thing I didn't grow up here.
39940,Matt, So where do you come from?
39941,Sarah," Give me the year, and I'll give you the town and foster home. (She says, she then tries to open a drawer on Tripp's desk which is locked) Oh, good. Wonder what's in here."
39942,Matt, It's locked.
39943,Sarah, Locked means important. (she says breaking into the drawer)
39944,Matt," Hey Care, did you get him?"
39945,Caroline," No. Enzo is not here, any idea where Tripp might have taken him? (Sarah gets the drawer open) Besides the very obvious one?"
39946,Matt," Hang on, let me see that. (he takes the phone and turns it on revealing a picture of Ivy on the wallpaper, he touches the recent calls icon which shows a missed call from Caroline Forbes) Caroline, we have another problem Tripp has Ivy's phone."
39947,Caroline," And? I mean the guy is a m*rder, petty theft isn't much of a stretch."
39948,Matt," Yeah, but your name is at the top of the recent dialed list."
39949,Caroline," Oh, my god, he knows what I am."
39950,Matt, I'm guessing he knows where to find you.
39951,Bonnie (voicemail), It's Bonnie. Leave me a message. (Beep)
39952,Damon," That's it? That's your outgoing message. Really? I mean, the onetime I'm actively seeking the sound of your voice, that's all I get. Perfect. Hmm...Anyway, I'm in your room, which is a lot less weird than it sounds but I just wanted to say that because of what you did for me today is the day I get to see Elena. So thank you, and I'm sorry. Other than that, I don't know what to say or what I'm supposed to say except that, defying all possible global scenarios, I might miss you a little bit. (Damon's phone beeps; he is getting another call) Ooh, hey, I got to go. (He switches over to his other call) So you didn't forget my number. That's a good start."
39953,Elena, (walking down the street) Yeah I figured that I'd press the Damon button and see what happened.
39954,Damon, And what is happening?
39955,Elena, I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing. I just... I'm thinking we should meet face to face. I can't run from you forever so come by my dorm?
39956,Damon," Yeah, yeah I'll be here... there; I'll be there, absolutely in a bit. See you in a little bit."
39957,Elena, Okay. (she hangs up)
39958,Damon, Well that was fast. (he says turning only to see Tripp holding a Vervain g*n)
39959,Tripp, (groans) Ah' (he grabs at his knee)
39960,Damon, Who are you?
39961,Damon," Uh! (he groans, releasing Tripp to see two guys who have sh*t him, before he collapses and everything goes black). "
39962,Elena, Damon-
39963,Alaric," Elena calm down just find Caroline and get to Old Miller Road. We'll get him back. (He hangs up and leaves his classroom, locking the doors behind him then turns to face Jo who stands in front of him with her arms folded). "
39964,Jo, I had an interesting conversation with Elena.
39965,Alaric, Yeah and I want to hear all about it just not right now.
39966,Jo, What's the rush? Occult studies emergency?
39967,Alaric," Yeah, I have someplace I need to be so if you don't mind. (He tries to pass her but she blocks his way)"
39968,Jo, Why don't you just compel me out of the way. (Alaric sighs) Look don't you think it's about time we level with each other.
39969,Alaric," Okay how's this, my best friend, he just came back from the dear but now I have to save him from a vampire hunter before he is driven across an antimagic border and k*ll again so here's some friendly advice. It's probably a good idea to stay as far away from me as possible. (He leaves)"
39970,Damon, (groans) Uh'
39971,Enzo," Morning, sunshine."
39972,Damon," Enzo, (Damon looks to see the chains on his hands) well this brings back memories."
39973,Enzo," I'm glad to see you found a way back, mate. Afraid it's going to be a short reunion though. We're headed for Mystic Falls known for it's bridges; quaint, small town charm and a really big vampire bug zapper. (Damon pulls at the chains)"
39974,Damon, Stefan could've told me there was a hunter in town.
39975,Enzo, It probably slipped his mind because he's responsible for my return to incarceration.
39976,Damon, Why would he do that?
39977,Enzo, Probably jealous of my accent. Eh' maybe he did it because I k*ll his new girlfriend.
39978,Damon, Yeah that'll do it.
39979,Caroline," Sorry Mom, Elena is auditioning for ""Top Gear"" (they get out of the car) Yeah, ok, bye. (She hangs up) So my mom is shutting down Route 13 Tripp will have to double back and there's only two other ways across the border."
39980,Caroline," Do you have a preference? Front, back? (Elena leans against the car still staring straight ahead) No? Okay. (she pops one of the tires and the air explodes from it causing the car to sink down and Elena turns to face her) I think this sells a spinout. (Elena turns back again toward the dark road) What do you think? Elena?"
39981,Elena, I want my memories back.
39982,Caroline, Wait. What? (Elena turns to face her)
39983,Elena," I made up my mind, if Damon survives this, then I want Alaric to uncompel me. I mean, I can't imagine ever loving him but I also can't ignore the parts I don't like just to avoid the truth. I mean how could I make any decisions if I only know half the story? (Caroline rubs her arm affectionately and they turn to face the road ahead of them, waiting for Tripp's arrival). "
39984,Alaric," (watching him) You don't have to take apart the whole engine we just need to lure Tripp in so we can grab him. (Stefan continues taking the engine apart) You know, it's not your fault."
39985,Stefan, Pretty much is.
39986,Alaric," Look. You're not the only one who gave up. You know every second for the last four months all I could think about was when I'm gonna get my next sip of bl*od, when am I gonna screw up and hurt somebody, why did I come back to life just to be this thing. That I used to hunt vampires and suddenly I was one. Searching for Damon was the only thing that could take my mind off of it, but I was basically going through the motions as a distraction because, honestly Stefan, I'd given up, too. (Alaric spots headlights approaching) There. (Stefan turns)"
39987,Stefan, That's him.
39988,Alaric, You should stay in the carhe knows what you look like.
39989,Stefan, He thinks I'm on his side.
39990,Alaric," Yeah unless Enzo told him different. Go tell Elena he's here. (Stefan gets in the car as Alaric approaches Tripp's slowing vehicle, waving his arms over his head and whistling to get his attention)."
39991,Alaric, Evening. (Tripp rolls his window down partially) I tried to get my buddy to a bachelor party and our car just stopped you think you can uh help us out?
39992,Tripp, Oh' don't know anything about cars.
39993,Alaric," Yeah, oh well, maybe you could give us a ride then?"
39994,Enzo, Who's that?
39995,Damon," Ric. He's up to something. Better be something good, bastard owes me."
39996,Tripp," Sorry, in a bit of a hurry."
39997,Alaric," Yeah. So are we. (Alaric punches through the glass of the window it shatters knocing Tripp back, Alaric grabs Tripp by the collar and punches him in the face). "
39998,Tripp," Uh! Ooh! (He groans and grabs his Vervain g*n, sh**ting Alaric in the shoulder with it. Alaric holds onto the side of the vehicle as Tripp slams down on the gas heading straight for Stefan's Car. Stefan, on his cell phone looks up just in time to see the approaching vehicle. He vamp speeds out of the car just before Tripp's van crashes into it, flipping over; flying through the air and crashing over the Mystic Falls sign landing upside down. Alaric is thrown off the vehicle)"
39999,Alaric, Uh! Ugh! Uh! (He groans as he hits the ground within Mystic Falls). 
40000,Elena, Stefan. Stefan what's happening?
40001,Stefan, Damon and Alaric are across the border. I got to go. (he hangs up)
40002,Elena, Oh my god. (she whispers)
40003,Stefan," (groaning) Agh! Ugh! Aagh! Ah! (panting, he presses forward picking up a crow bar on the road)"
40004,Damon, I came back for this. (Enzo spits up bl*od)
40005,Enzo," Consumption, wasn't much fun the first time around either. (Stefan uses the crow bar to break into the back of Tripp's van)."
40006,Jo," It's okay, I'm here. I followed you like a crazy stalker. Not one of my finer moments."
40007,Damon," No, no. Get him! (Stefan uses the crow bar to get Enzo loose from the chains that are attached to the top of the van. He then gets Damon loose. Tripp comes out of the front of his vehicle, bl*od gushing from his head; instead of facing off with his enemies he runs away. Damon, Stefan and Enzo struggle out of the van)"
40008,Alaric, You have to get me across the border. (Jo is using her first aid knowledge to help him) It's stripping away the magic. I'll die.
40009,Jo," You'll die if I move you. I have to stop the bleeding, you nicked your descending aorta."
40010,Alaric," I know, that's what k*ll me."
40011,Jo, (holding up a package) And you didn't have me back then did you (she rips it open with her teeth) and you didn't have hemostatic gauze.
40012,Stefan," Get up, come on get up. (he holds them both up; linking one of his arms with Enzo and the other with Damon as they struggle down the road and toward the border; grasping their stomach's, couching up bl*od and panting. Finally they reach the safety zone; Enzo and Damon drop to the ground coughing, panting, groaning and trying to catch thier breaths as their wounds heal. Stefan turns back toward Mystic Falls knowing Alaric is still on the other side)."
40013,Alaric, What's happening?
40014,Jo," You still with me? While I'm sealing this wound. (she applies gauze to his bloody chest, her hand covered in his bl*od) I want you to think about how you tried to compel one of the smartest women on campus to forget about her date with you. The date where I single handedly saved dozens of lives without smearing my makeup. (She works quickly, Alaric gasps) Alaric? Hang on! Stay with me. Come on. (She starts pumping on his chest) Gonna get that heart pumping. (He gasps) You don't get to have the last word with me. Alaric! (Alaric stops moving, his eyes now closed) Alaric! (she screams, pumping on his chest, but there is nothing. Alaric remains still)."
40015,Jo," Stay with me! come on! (Suddenly Alaric's head snaps up, his eyes open and he gasps for air) Ah'"
40016,Alaric, So-so-something's wrong.
40017,Jo, (stroking his face) Don't move.
40018,Alaric," No, something's wrong. I'm not supposed to be alive."
40019,Jo, There's no reason you shouldn't be. I sealed the wound we just have to get you to the hospital. (He breathes heavily and rests his head back on the grass). 
40020,Caroline," (quietly) Yeah, I'll tell her. Thanks. (She hangs up as Elena vamp speeds up to her, coming from the opposite direction)"
40021,Elena, I was just on Route 9 and there was a crash but they weren't there.
40022,Caroline, Yeah I know they had to get out of there.
40023,Elena, What happened?
40024,Caroline," (sigh) Uh Stefan said that...uhm. (she stares at Elena, not able to find the words)"
40025,Elena," What, Caroline? What? (she asks nervously)"
40026,Caroline," Alaric crossed the border, but Jo was there and she saved him."
40027,Elena," (relieved) So he's okay, that means he's okay, right? (she presses the question when Caroline doesn't immediately answer)"
40028,Caroline, Yeah Elena he's okay.
40029,Elena, Then why do you have that look on your face? What happened Caroline?
40030,Caroline," All the magic stripped away, but Jo saved him just before he died."
40031,Elena," (not comprehending) What, I don't know what that means, Caroline."
40032,Caroline," Alaric is not a vampire anymore, Elena. He's human. (Elena is shocked and troubled by this news knowing what it means)."
40033,Sarah, Thanks for the ride.
40034,Matt, (closing the door behind him) Yeah I thought I'd save you the trouble of having to boost another car.
40035,Sarah," (smiles) That was almost funny, hope for you yet Donovan."
40036,Matt, If I told you I knew about your family promise to take a little friendly advice.
40037,Sarah," Hang on, you know who my family is?"
40038,Matt, Read any history book about this town's founding members. The guys that live in this house are Damon and Stefan Salvatore.
40039,Sarah, Why are you just telling me this now?
40040,Matt, Because (pause) they're vampires and wherever they go death and pain always follow so if you're looking for family you're not going to find it here. Do yourself a favor and get as far away from this place as you can.
40041,Jeremy, COME ON! (Matt and Sarah turn and run toward him) NO! DAMN IT! (he screams)
40042,Matt, Jer...
40043,Jeremy," I keep trying to cancel Bonnie's plhone but I can't without her pin. Why can't I remember her pin? (In anger, he slams the phone down on the pool table, smashing it into pieces; he holds up his hand it is cut open with jagged pieces of the broken phone sticking out of it, shaking slightly. He then smashes his hand through a bottle of alcohol that sits on the pool table; glass flying everywhere. He bangs his fist over and over again into the pool table. Matt and Sarah grab ahold of him). "
40044,Jeremy," Get off! get off! (he screams, fighting against them)"
40045,Sarah, It's gonna be okay.
40046,Jeremy," No it's not! She's gone! Bonnie is gone. (He pants, as Matt hugs him)"
40047,Elena," Jo's a keeper, how does it feel?"
40048,Alaric," (in a hospital bed) Oh, it hurts a lot."
40049,Elena," Well, it's too bad there aren't any vampires in Mystic Falls to help heal you."
40050,Alaric," Well, I think they got me on a morphine drip. It's the next best thing. (Pause) Elena, I'm so sorry."
40051,Elena," No, no, no Alaric I'm just glad that you're okay. I mean up until an hour ago I didn't even want my memories to return. I was the one who made the choice to lose them. Now I have to live with the fact that you can't give them back to me. I know how much you hated being a vampire so I'm just glad one of us got what we wanted."
40052,Alaric, And what is it that you want?
40053,Elena," To be able to look Damon in the eye, knowing all that I know and all that I don't, and see how I feel about him. I want to trust how I feel."
40054,Alaric," I hope that you can. Good luck, okay? (Elena hangs up)"
40055,Jo, This hospital sucks! I can't believe anyone even makes it out of here alive.
40056,Alaric, They usually don't.
40057,Jo, I'm having you transferred to Whitmore ASAP.
40058,Alaric, Thank you.
40059,Jo, (smiles) Just doing my job.
40060,Alaric," Hey, (taking her hand) you did more than that. You gave me back my life. Thank you."
40061,Damon, I was this close...This close.
40062,Stefan, I know. I'm sorry.
40063,Damon," Oh I got it, everybody's sorry. You're sorry you gave up on me, sorry you turned Enzo into that hunter guy. Ric's sorry for the compulsion. I'm sure if Elena could remember anything she'd be sorry too. (He says annoyed, drinking)."
40064,Stefan, You got to understand how hard it was for her.
40065,Damon, I am so tired of hearing how hard it was for her. It was hard for me as well.
40066,Stefan," At least you knew you had a home to come back to. She didn't have anything, to her you were just gone."
40067,Damon, Guess I still am. Ric said she's happy without me since she's erased me. You know what I don't want her to be happy. I want her to be miserable just like I am.
40068,Stefan, (unamused) You done?
40069,Damon, Yeah. I'm done.
40070,Stefan," Good, now quit stalling there's a girl you need to go see."
40071,Damon, What if it doesn't work? What if what we had isn't strong enough to break the compulsion?
40072,Stefan," You're not going to find out just sitting there, are you?"
40073,Damon," (thinking about it for a moment, then finishing his drink) Here's goes everything. (He leaves; Stefan sighs and sits along at the table until he spots Caroline walks down the street. He quickly leaves the restaurant to catch up to her)."
40074,Stefan, Hey.
40075,Caroline," (turning toward him) Hey, so am I your last stop on the Stefan Salvatore apology tour?"
40076,Stefan," Could we just get past this, please?"
40077,Caroline, I'm trying to.
40078,Stefan," Look, Caroline. What do you want me to do huh? Stop making me guess and tell me so we can go back to being friends again."
40079,Caroline," Yeah well you know that's the thing Stefan after all of this, I-I don't want to be friends anymore. (She walks away, leaving him alone on the street; he sighs and shoves his hands in his pockets)"
40080,Elena, I want my memories back.
40081,Damon," ( nervous ) Okay, I'll start. I know Alaric eternal sunshined our relationship out of your brain but please, please tell me it's coming back."
40082,Damon," Or at least part of it, because...imagining this exact moment is what got me through the last few months."
40083,Elena, I'm not sure what to say.
40084,Damon," Easy, so easy."
40085,Damon," Just say, that you missed me as much as I missed you."
40086,Elena, I remember...pain.
40087,Elena, I remember all the terrible things that you did to the people I care about.
40088,Elena, I honestly don't remember anything good between us.
40089,Elena, I thought if I saw you in person it might change everything but...
40090,Damon, Maybe you just need a little more time.
40091,Elena," Damon, I know that I loved you."
40092,Damon, Yeah.
40093,Elena, And I know that apparently I forgave you for all of the awful things that you did.
40094,Damon," Yeah, w..."
40095,Elena," But I just don't remember it. I'm sorry, I just don't...feel it anymore. I'm sorry."
40096,Damon," Yeah, um... I'm"
40097,Damon, ( whispering ) Yeah
40098,Elena," ( grabbing for the door ) Damon, I-I really am sorry."
40099,Alaric, Hey. I really don't think you should be playing with all that stuff.
40100,Damon," Keep going. We are on a roll. All the terrible things I did to people that Elena cared about. Let's see. I turned Caroline into my own personal bl*od juice box, I turned Matt's sister into a vampire and threatened to k*ll Bon-Bon a couple times."
40101,Alaric, More than a couple.
40102,Damon," Subjective. Sometimes, I was being funny."
40103,Alaric, And you k*ll Stefan's best friend at his birthday party.
40104,Damon, Unfortunate coincidence.
40105,Alaric, And then you snapped Jeremy's neck when Elena said she'd never love you.
40106,Damon," On second thought, let's focus on all the charming, heroic things you obliterated from my girl's mind."
40107,Alaric," God, if I could take it all back, I would."
40108,Damon," I know. And listen. Despite the fact that my long list of dastardly deeds involves k*ll you, I'm glad you're alive."
40109,Alaric," Thanks, man."
40110,Damon, Yeah.
40111,Damon," Although had you actually died a vampire instead of becoming human again, your compulsion would have gone away, and Elena would be mine again."
40112,Alaric, Hey. Really heartfelt. Appreciate it.
40113,Damon, Now she's stuck with only evil me memories forever and ever.
40114,Alaric," If you k*ll me, I am dead for good this time. You remember that."
40115,Jo, Good morning.
40116,Alaric, Hey. I don't know if this is a good time.
40117,Damon," Just a heads-up, doc. You're gonna be in real high demand with a bunch of vampires who want to be human again if you could repeat that little healing trick that you did at the border with Ric last night."
40118,Jo," Well, just a heads-up, but saving Alaric's life was a matter of a treatable death wound, perfect timing, and fear of losing the most interesting guy I've dated in a while adrenaline. One hundred percent unrepeatable, which is why you will tell no one."
40119,Damon, She's bossy.
40120,Alaric, Mm-hmm.
40121,Damon, I like her.
40122,Jo, Do you have a nice suit and a clean pair of socks?
40123,Alaric," Uh, yeah, I think so."
40124,Jo," Good. I'm releasing you. Hospital fundraiser's tonight. I'm making the interns go, so I need a date. I'll start your paperwork."
40125,Enzo," Hello again. That was quite a mess you made at the border last night. Hit and run. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Good thing Matt here was in the neighborhood to give you a ride home."
40126,Tripp, You brought me here?
40127,Matt, You went after my friends. What'd you expect?
40128,Tripp, Your friends who k*ll people.
40129,Stefan," Come on, Enzo. Ask him what you want to know. Let's get this over with."
40130,Enzo," Stefan has already made a very passionate argument in favor of snapping your neck, whereas in a surprising role reversal, I've opted for the ""let's think this through, get all the information before we k*ll him"" method."
40131,Matt," Don't be a dick. You know, you can dry the vervain out of him, compel him to forget everything, and he'll never set foot in Mystic Falls again."
40132,Enzo," You don't really think he's a one-man vampire busting operation, do you? Look. While Tripp tortured me for the names of your friends, I had a front-row seat to quite a few urgent phone calls and visits from mysterious right-hand men, many of whom were wearing uniforms not dissimilar to the one you've been traipsing around in. I'd just like to know what they're up to while he's here with us."
40133,Tripp, Aah! Aah. They're doing the same thing they were when they were with me. They're tracking vampires like your friend Caroline Forbes.
40134,Stefan," Take two hours, get the names of his men and what they know. After that, he's a liability. Get rid of him."
40135,Caroline, You didn't feel anything?
40136,Elena," I felt scared and guilty, and his eyes were really, really blue and pretty, but... no. I don't remember loving him."
40137,Caroline, So you don't remember. So be it.
40138,Elena, That's your advice?
40139,Caroline," Well, Elena, look at your life right now. You're doing well in school, you're following your dreams, you met Liam, who also has very pretty eyes, not mention he's never k*ll your brother."
40140,Elena, True.
40141,Caroline," I mean, I just gave Stefan the friend boot. Maybe a little break from the Salvatore brothers is in the cards for the both of us. Look. McDreamy's coming. I got to go. I'll see you later."
40142,Elena, Bye.
40143,Liam, So guess who came into the hospital for a shoulder arthroscopy this morning.
40144,Elena," Hello to you, too."
40145,Liam," Lady Whitmore, the girl from the bonfire, the one you miraculously saved from certain death and I can't figure out how. Turns out she was here on a tennis scholarship before she blew out her arm last year. Now she needs to get her cartilage cleaned out every 6 months."
40146,Elena, You're still obsessing over that.
40147,Liam, But here's the crazy part. She doesn't remember getting hurt in the corn maze crash.
40148,Elena, Wow! She must have been really drunk.
40149,Liam," I'm gonna take a look at her labs, see if she's not an alien or a super soldier or something."
40150,Elena, When do volunteers have access to the patient labs?
40151,Liam," Since never, but if you rat me out, you can't be my date to the hospital fundraiser tonight."
40152,Elena," Yeah? Well, we have to go. Jo said that it's mandatory."
40153,Liam, Doesn't mean it can't still be a date.
40154,Kai, Oh. Look who's awake. How do you feel?
40155,Bonnie, Like you sh*t me with an arrow.
40156,Kai," Right. Anyhoo, I have no idea how you managed to shatter the ascendant into a billion pieces, but we need to put it together before the eclipse at 12:28. You want to help? I know you're a puzzle person."
40157,Bonnie," I don't want to help. You're a psychopath. This place is your prison. I'm not letting you out. Besides, you'll just k*ll me the minute we get out."
40158,Kai," You've been through a trauma. Your memory's probably a little fuzzy right now, so you might be thinking that your magic will protect you, but all I have to do is hold your hand, and your magic suddenly becomes mine."
40159,Kai, What was that? Huh? What? You're gonna do the spell and finally get us home?
40160,Caroline, That's weird.
40161,Stefan, What's weird?
40162,Caroline," None of your business. We're not friends anymore, which means you can't just show up unannounced at my door. Good bye."
40163,Stefan," Hey, Caroline. Look. You're not safe. Tripp's men still have your name."
40164,Caroline," So, what? You here to protect me? News flash! I don't need your protection, and more importantly, I don't want it."
40165,Caroline," Hey, mom. Can I call you back? I'm trying to get a piece of gum off of my shoe."
40166,Sheriff Forbes," Actually, honey, this can't wait. Do you have any idea where Tripp Cook might be?"
40167,Caroline, Tripp? No. I have no idea. Why?
40168,Sheriff Forbes," Because one of his men just ran me off the road, and they're gonna k*ll me if they don't get him back."
40169,Caroline," Answer your phone, Enzo! I just... I didn't call her today, you know? I always call my mom every Saturday morning, but, no, today, I said, ""screw it. I want to sleep in. I'll do it tomorrow."""
40170,Stefan," Well, don't worry. We're almost there."
40171,Caroline," We're almost there? You said, two hours and then k*ll him."" Do you even remember how long ago you said that? I mean, what kind of person sets a ticking clock without setting his watch?"
40172,Caroline, Tell me that Tripp is still alive.
40173,Enzo," Tripp is still alive, surprisingly torture-resistant but alive."
40174,Caroline, What took you so long to answer your phone?
40175,Enzo," My fingers were covered in bl*od, and the touchscreen wouldn't work."
40176,Caroline," Just don't k*ll him, ok? One of his guys took my mom, so just keep your hands off of him so I can get her back, ok? Enzo, please."
40177,Tripp," I thought I could make the world a better place by getting rid of them, teach kids like you to be strong, defend yourselves, but look at you. You're on the wrong side."
40178,Matt," I'm not on the wrong side, man. My side's just really freaking complicated."
40179,Enzo, Update. Tripp's henchmen kidnapped the sheriff of Mystic Falls.
40180,Matt, What?
40181,Tripp, It's a contingency plan in case anything ever happened to me.
40182,Matt, That's your idea of being on the right side?
40183,Tripp, You can set the meet for the edge of town of Old Miller road. You can do the trade there. They know they'll be safe behind the border. And send Matt. They trust him.
40184,Bonnie, Antibiotics. k*ll.
40185,"( She swallows a few pills and replaces the bandage on her abdomen, almost crying from the pain. She looks at the clock as she reassembles the Ascendant – it's 10",45 )
40186,Bonnie, An hour and 43 minutes. I can do this.
40187,Liv, Seriously? You don't know how to fill a champagne glass?
40188,Tyler, I never said I was a professional.
40189,Liv," First and most obvious rule, they all have to be even and no slopping over the sides."
40190,Tyler, Thank you.
40191,Liv," For what, not firing you? I'm not even paying you."
40192,Tyler, For letting me try to repay you.
40193,Liv," I k*ll someone so that you wouldn't trigger your werewolf curse, and you think that being my bar back for a night is enough to repay me?"
40194,Tyler," Honestly, I'd rather chain myself up in a cellar and turn every month than have to wear this lame-ass tie."
40195,Liv, Which isn't straight.
40196,Liv, You should take some pride in your appearance.
40197,Alaric," So what are you, the guest of honor or something?"
40198,Jo, I won an award for a battlefield medical clamp I patented. Whitmore likes to trot me out when they want to raise money.
40199,Alaric," So basically, you're a genius."
40200,Damon," Or she has a witchy advantage. What, supposed to be a secret that she's a witch?"
40201,Jo," I don't practice, so no witchy advantage, just a lot of hard work. ( to Alaric ) Who invited him?"
40202,Alaric," He sort of invited himself, mostly to stalk Elena."
40203,Damon," Oh, don't be cynical. I'm here to spend some quality time with my once dead, now human best bud."
40204,Damon, Who's that?
40205,Jo," That would be Liam Davis, valedictorian, straight A's freshman year taking junior-level classes, not to mention medical royalty. Not so bad on the eyes either. Looks like he's Elena's date."
40206,Damon, Did I say I liked you? I meant the opposite.
40207,Liam," You know those things are rigged, right?"
40208,Elena, Is that another one of your conspiracy theories? Super soldiers take over the world to carry out vicious fundraising schemes?
40209,Liam," Well, when you say it like that, I sound like a loser."
40210,Elena," When I win my trip to Fiji, you don't have to come."
40211,Elena, Oh. Ok. Maybe you can come.
40212,Elena, Can you grab us a couple drinks?
40213,Liam, Sure.
40214,Elena, Sorry. I didn't know that you were here.
40215,Liam, Hey. Wine or beer?
40216,Elena," You know, um, it doesn't matter, whatever you want."
40217,Damon," Hi. Damon Salvatore, Elena's ex. Nice to meet you..."
40218,Liam, Liam.
40219,Damon, Liam.
40220,Liam, Wait. Damon?
40221,Damon, Damon.
40222,Liam, As in the ex who died?
40223,Elena," Right. Yeah, um, that is what I... What I told you. Obviously, that's not true."
40224,Damon," It's a figure of speech. It's more kind of an emotional death. You know, it was a very messy breakup, but we're past that now, right? We're... we're in the friend stage."
40225,Elena, Right.
40226,Damon, Yeah.
40227,Elena, Yeah.
40228,Damon, So the ex meets the new guy. Heh. ( compelling ) How freaked out are you right now?
40229,Liam," I feel a little threatened, but I think I could take you."
40230,Damon, Confident. Pfft. Sexy.
40231,Elena, Damon.
40232,Liam, I'm sorry. What's going on?
40233,Damon," Focus. ( compelling ) Go the bar, get her a Chardonnay."
40234,Elena, I hate Chardonnay.
40235,Damon, I know.
40236,Elena, What are you doing?
40237,Damon, I'll explain on the dance floor. May I?
40238,Enzo," Hello, gorgeous."
40239,Caroline, What did you do to him?
40240,Enzo," Oh, he's fine. Just a little bl*od loss. I think he may have an iron deficiency problem."
40241,Stefan, Knock it off. Her mother's life is on the line.
40242,Enzo," Hang on. Just so I'm clear. All Caroline had to do to get you to treat her with a modicum of respect, is to stop paying attention to you. Is that how this works?"
40243,Caroline," Shut up, Enzo. And did he really need 3 chains? I mean, who is this guy, the Hulk?"
40244,Stefan," Well, I didn't restrain him."
40245,Caroline," No, but you let your sidekick Enzo do it because what could go wrong when you team up with your sworn enemy?"
40246,Enzo, Oh. That's brilliant. Of course that's why she hates you. That's how you worked her into such a state in Savannah. That's why she told you to go take a leap. She hates you because she doesn't hate you at all.
40247,Stefan, I'm sorry. Are you still talking?
40248,Enzo," She got a thing for you, mate. ( to Caroline ) Tell your mum I send my best."
40249,Caroline," Whatever he just said, it will never be discussed again, ok?"
40250,Stefan, Mm-hmm.
40251,Elena, Why are you doing this?
40252,Damon," Why? Well, because I'm an incredible dancer, and it would be a shame not to share my talent with the world. Oh. Don't worry. I didn't see you smile."
40253,Damon," Miss Mystic Falls. First time we ever danced. Stefan stood you up... Bloodlust issues, surprise, surprise... So I stepped in."
40254,Elena, You're trying to stir up memories. This isn't a good idea.
40255,Damon," I stepped in, sexy as hell, and saved you from complete and utter humiliation. Of course, you were just worried about Stefan, but there was this moment, this one moment, where everyone else fell away, and it was just the two of us."
40256,Elena," Look. I'm here with someone, Damon. You can't just come unannounced and ruin my night."
40257,Damon, Come unannounced? What are you talking about? I literally went through time and space to be with you.
40258,Elena," I know, but look. Do you want me to feel guilty? Because trust me, Damon. I do, ok? I feel horrible, and I'm sorry, but I don't... I don't know what to tell you. What do you want me to say? I don't remember us."
40259,Damon," I do, and no matter how much I missed you or how much pain I was in, I never would have erased everything we ever had. Even if I was drowning in grief, I'd rather hang on to every moment that I ever held you or every laugh that I ever heard, every shred of happiness that we ever had. I would rather spend every moment in agony than erase the memory of you."
40260,Elena, I need some air.
40261,Jo, So that seems to be going well.
40262,Alaric, Yeah. That's my fault. I shouldn't have compelled her.
40263,Jo," You shouldn't mix k*ll and booze. Whatever you did for Elena, that's her choice. Remember that. No pun intended."
40264,Alaric," I am not on k*ll. In fact, I feel awful, but I am enjoying every miserable human moment of pain."
40265,Jo, To being powerless and mundane.
40266,Alaric, Cheers.
40267,Alaric, Ahh. So I guess we are both formerly supernatural beings. Should we start a support group?
40268,Jo," Well, technically, I relinquished my magic and put it away for safekeeping."
40269,Alaric, I didn't know you could do that.
40270,Jo," Let's just say I chose to remove myself from a tragically dysfunctional family, and I haven't regretted a moment of it."
40271,Liv, Hey. Who let you in?
40272,Luke, Oh. A radiologist I met at the gym. So what's the story with Tyler?
40273,Liv," It's a short story called ""mind your own business."""
40274,Luke," Liv, I'm not saying don't have fun, ok, because that's why we're here, but when the coven calls us home, they don't care if we're in love or not."
40275,Liv," You sound like dad, and that's not a compliment."
40276,Luke, Liv.
40277,Liv, Have fun with your gym fling. Leave me to mine.
40278,Bonnie, Where's the last piece? Where is it? This isn't happening.
40279,Kai," Looking for this? You stole the ascendant, naughty girl. You weren't planning on using and leaving me behind, were you? You left a trail of bl*od in the driveway. Figured where else would you stop and play nurse?"
40280,Bonnie, Vados!
40281,Bonnie, Aah! Unh! Get off me!
40282,Kai," I thought about taking the keys, but that'd be like taking the cheese out of a mousetrap, right, Bonnie? Although, you know, fun fact. Mice don't actually like cheese. Isn't that great? Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. So we have an hour until the eclipse. It's time to go home, Bonnie."
40283,Elena, I want to remember.
40284,Damon," Well, you're a day late and a dollar short, honey?"
40285,Elena," I mean, I want to try. Knowing that there's this whole piece of my life missing, it's... it's driving me crazy, ok? So I have to at least try to get it back."
40286,Damon, Yeah. How are you supposed to do that?
40287,Elena," I know there's nothing we can do about the compulsion, but maybe if we unwind the memories backwards, something might trigger something, and maybe they'll all come back, right?"
40288,Damon, Yeah. Sure. Tell me what you want me to do.
40289,Elena, Take me to the last place I told you I loved you.
40290,Kai, I brought you a present.
40291,Kai, Ta-da! Ms. Cuddles! Thought you might want to bring her along.
40292,Bonnie, Thanks.
40293,Kai," I know you think I'm a monster. I mean, I did m*rder or heavily maim most of my immediate family, but after a long period of self-reflection, I've come to the conclusion that I could have handled my anger better."
40294,Bonnie," You said you wanted to get out of here... And I quote... ""To give the rest of the Gemini coven an excruciating death."""
40295,Kai," I didn't mean it. Honestly, I would do anything to get my family back, and the thing I'm most scared of is trying to figure out how to live in the world again. Sort of hoping you've been a positive influence on me. You're a good person, Bonnie. You're brave, loyal, patient. I want to be more like you. ( Kai uses a high-pitched voice for Ms. Cuddles ) What do you say? Friends?"
40296,Bonnie, Let's just go home.
40297,Stefan, They're here.
40298,Caroline, Mom?
40299,Matt," Caroline, stop! The border."
40300,Caroline, You're bleeding? What'd you do to her?
40301,Sheriff Forbes, I'm fine.
40302,Matt," Ok. Let's do this. Let her go, and you can have him."
40303,Man with the g*n, Tripp first.
40304,Caroline," Let her go, or I'll k*ll you."
40305,Sheriff Forbes," Sweetheart, it's ok. Stefan, let Tripp go."
40306,Caroline, He's across. Now let her go.
40307,Matt, Are you ok?
40308,Tripp, What's happening to me?
40309,Caroline," Oh, my God."
40310,Matt, What the hell did you do?
40311,Stefan, Wasn't me. Enzo must have turned him into a vampire before we got there.
40312,Kai, It's now or never.
40313,Kai, Just in case you thought you'd try to go without me.
40314,Kai," So long, 1994."
40315,Kai, What the hell's happening?
40316,Bonnie, I don't know.
40317,Kai, Keep going. Hurry.
40318,Bonnie, I can't.
40319,Kai, Keep going!
40320,Bonnie, I can't. I've lost my magic.
40321,Kai, What are you talking about? You were just doing the spell.
40322,Kai, There's nothing there. There's no magic.
40323,Bonnie," It's so strange. I wonder if I accidentally put it somewhere. Oh, I remember now. I put it somewhere safe."
40324,Kai, Where did you put your magic?
40325,Bonnie," Do you remember saying you wanted to be more like me... Brave, loyal, patient?"
40326,Kai," You put it in the bear, didn't you?"
40327,Kai," Come on! Where's the stupid bear, hmm?"
40328,Bonnie," Oh, it's gone. I guess we're stuck here forever. Sorry."
40329,Elena, I don't remember being here with you that night.
40330,Damon, Ok. What do you remember? How are you rewired?
40331,Elena, I remember that we had to stop the travelers.
40332,Damon, Yeah.
40333,Elena," You had a plan, but you didn't tell anyone what you were doing, and the next thing I know, you're dead. I heard that you drove your car into the grill and then blew yourself up so that you could trigger some expl*si*n."
40334,Damon, There's just one little part of that story that you're missing. You got in the car with me.
40335,Elena, What?!
40336,Damon," I was all ready to go, and the door opens, and you jump in the car and say, ""we're in this together,"" and you weren't taking no for an answer. That was the moment I realized you were the perfect girl for me because you were just as crazy as I was."
40337,Elena, Ok. Tell me more. Something happy?
40338,Damon," Ok. Happy. Well, there is a motel ice machine in Denver that's got some stories."
40339,Elena, What else?
40340,Damon," Well, can't forget the night of your graduation."
40341,Elena," Well, I did, so..."
40342,Damon," Shame. Probably one of your best speeches. You in your very passionate and adorable way told me you were in love with me, and hell if you were gonna apologize for it. My favorite memory of us, oh, one that I've relived a million times over the last 4 months is this summer night that we had before you went off to college. You wanted to show me this meteor shower, so we drove out in the middle of nowhere, and the moment those sh**ting stars started to fall, rain, lots of rain. You were so sure it would clear, and it was just easier to believe you, and I took your hand..."
40343,Elena, This isn't working. I'm sorry.
40344,Damon, Hey. Maybe you just need to try a little harder.
40345,Elena," I am trying! I get that we had an amazing life together, and I know that I loved the fact that you were reckless and probably made me feel very free, but now when I look into your eyes, I just..."
40346,Damon, What? What do you feel like?
40347,Elena," I feel like... Like I'm looking at a stranger because I'm never gonna be able to give you what you want, because I just can't remember."
40348,Damon," Hey. There are things you can't erase, and you know that. ( He holds her face in his hands ) Hey."
40349,Damon, Sorry.
40350,Damon, Where are you going? Elena! Hey!
40351,Damon, Elena!
40352,Damon, Elena!
40353,Damon," Hey! What the hell are you doing? Ninety more seconds, you'd be dead. Hey."
40354,Elena, I'm trying to undo the compulsion. It's the only way.
40355,Damon," No, no, no, no. Hey. Listen. I would give anything for you to remember, but I'm not gonna risk your life. It's the last thing I would ever do... Even if you don't remember that. Let's get you home."
40356,Sheriff Forbes, This is totally unnecessary.
40357,Caroline," You hit your head. You could have a concussion, and I know better than to trust that you're going to take yourself for a checkup back home."
40358,Caroline, You can go now. We're fine.
40359,Sheriff Forbes," Sweetheart, could you at least just check and see how long the wait is gonna be?"
40360,Caroline, Gladly.
40361,Sheriff Forbes, Ok.
40362,Sheriff Forbes, I see she's still icing you out.
40363,Stefan," Yeah. Anyway, you want to help me fix that?"
40364,Sheriff Forbes," Sorry, Stefan. I'm her mother. I'm not allowed."
40365,Stefan, Right.
40366,Caroline," I'll be right outside, ok?"
40367,Sheriff Forbes, Ok.
40368,Caroline, Please don't ask my mother for her opinions.
40369,Stefan, You heard that?
40370,Caroline, Yeah. I've got superhearing. I hear everything.
40371,Stefan, Only when you listen.
40372,Stefan, Why?
40373,Caroline, Why was I listening?
40374,Stefan, Why do you have a thing for me?
40375,Caroline, I don't.
40376,Stefan, Ok. Um... Why did you have a thing for me?
40377,Caroline," We said that we would never talk about this again, so just..."
40378,Stefan," Look, Caroline, please just talk to me. Tell me how, tell me why. Please just make me understand how it is that I missed it."
40379,Caroline," What kind of a stupid question is that? Why did I have a thing for you? I don't know, Stefan. Maybe it's because I thought you worth having a thing for, because when I woke up as a vampire you told me that I would get through it and I did, because when I watched Elena move on with your brother I couldn't imagine why she would let anyone like you go, because you were practically my best friend, because I trusted you."
40380,Stefan," I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not seeing it, I'm sorry for not..."
40381,Caroline, Feeling it back?
40382,Stefan," No. I didn't say that. I... I... Look. I don't know what I felt. You know, my head was all over the place, but I am incredibly sorry for the way that I treated you."
40383,Caroline," Yeah. Well... I know what you felt, Stefan, because even if just a little tiny piece of you felt for me what I was starting to feel for you, you wouldn't have walked away, and I don't hate you for that. I don't hate you for mourning your brother, I don't hate you for being the biggest jerk on the planet while doing so, and I accept your apology."
40384,Stefan, But you do still hate me.
40385,Caroline," Yes. Yeah, I hate you because if I don't hate you for ruining our friendship, then I have to hate myself for ruining it, and I think that I deserve better than that."
40386,Elena," I remembered something out there, just bits and pieces, but, um... There were these stars, and then it started to rain."
40387,Damon," When you became a vampire, part of me was thrilled because suddenly there was this possibility I could have you in my life forever, but then the other part of me was devastated because I realized you'd lost the life that you wanted to have."
40388,Elena," It started to rain, and then what happened, Damon?"
40389,Damon," And since I've been gone, you've gotten part of that life back. You're thriving, you're happy. Yeah, sure. Maybe you'd be happy if we gave it another chance, but the truth is is... You're better off without me."
40390,Elena, What are you talking about?
40391,Damon," I died. You started over. I need you to live your life. Be happy. I love you, Elena. Enough to let you go."
40392,Elena," It started to rain, and then what?"
40393,Damon," It got cold and muddy. You were miserable, so we got in the car and... We drove home."
40394,Alaric, Ok. Ohh. I might have to rethink this whole k*ll thing.
40395,Jo, I need to get out of this dress and order a pizza.
40396,Alaric, Ok.
40397,Alaric, Ouch.
40398,Jo, This? Yeah I had an accident when I was younger. I lost my spleen.
40399,Alaric, Car accident?
40400,Jo," Actually it was less an accident and more like my brother tried to gut me with a hunting kn*fe. Like I said, tragically dysfunctional family. I just k*ll the mood, didn't I?"
40401,Alaric," No, no. Let's just say, uh, we both have complicated, tragic, and dysfunctional histories. Guess we're a match."
40402,Liam, Hey.
40403,Elena, Hey. You're still talking to me. Sorry I ran out like that.
40404,Elena, What's this?
40405,Liam," So I finally got a look at lady Whitmore's labs. Turns out they sent her home without doing the shoulder surgery because the injury doesn't exist anymore. Seems to have spontaneously healed itself, and all this after meeting your dead boyfriend tonight? None of this adds up. The only thing that's really clear is that you're not just a liar, but you're a liar with secrets, so you can tell me the truth, or I can figure this out on my own."
40406,Damon," One for you, one for me. Cheers, Horatio Fell."
40407,Damon, Come on. It's time to abandon ship.
40408,Elena," No, no, no, wait. Just give it a second. It'll clear up."
40409,Elena, Promise me this is forever.
40410,Damon, I promise.
40411,Damon, To optimism.
40412,Damon, Bonnie. ( he hugs Ms. Cuddles ) You're still alive.
40413,Kai," To get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic."
40414,Elena, What about Bonnie?
40415,Damon, She sacrificed herself so I could come back.
40416,Kai, Where did you put your magic?
40417,Bonnie, I put it somewhere safe?
40418,Caroline," I hate you because if I don't hate you then I have to hate myself, and I deserve better than that."
40419,Enzo," She hates because she's got a thing for you, mate."
40420,Liam," I got a look at Lady Whitmore's labs. It turns out the injury doesn't exist anymore. You're not just a liar, but you're a liar with secrets."
40421,Tyler, Just trying to check what page we're on.
40422,Luke," When the coven calls us home, they don't care if we're in love or not."
40423,Liv," You sound like dad, and that's not a compliment."
40424,Kai (V.O.), Josette. Where are they?
40425,Kai (V.O.)," Oh, Jo. Come on out, Jo. I know you can hear me."
40426,Kai (V.O.)," Josette? Where are they, Jo?"
40427,Jo," ( whispering ) Hey. Everything's gonna be OK, all right? Everybody's just playing a game. You guys want to play a game? You want to play hide-and-seek? Shh. OK."
40428,Kai," Come on out, Jo. You know I won't k*ll you."
40429,Kai," Wakey, wakey."
40430,Kai, Ohh.
40431,Bonnie, How did I...
40432,Kai," Get so lucky to arrive here on a private flight piloted by yours truly? Oh, you would have been super-impressed with my flying k*ll, but I'd already knocked you out with k*ll."
40433,Bonnie, Where are we?
40434,Kai," Portland, Oregon, stomping grounds of Courtney Love, Tonya Harding, and tons of other awesome people."
40435,Bonnie," You could have brought me anywhere in the world, and you took me to Portland?"
40436,Kai, This is where I grew up.
40437,Bonnie, Ow!
40438,Kai," I've been counting eclipses since I was imprisoned on this empty planet, and according to my running tally, I've been here for 6,771 supernaturally repeating days, so in the real world, which we'll never get back to because you sent your magic away in a Teddy bear, today's my favorite day of the year."
40439,Bonnie, And what day is that?
40440,Kai, Thanksgiving. I'm cooking you dinner.
40441,Elena, I'm a vampire.
40442,Caroline, I don't know. Maybe a little less emphasis on vampire.
40443,Elena," I'm... a vampire. I mean, there's only so many ways you can say it."
40444,Caroline," Well, maybe Liam will stop digging into Lady Whitmore's miraculous recovery, and you won't have to come clean."
40445,Elena," Or he'll keep digging, realize that I force-fed her my vampire bl*od, and then just bail."
40446,Caroline, OK. You know all of this can go away with one fell mind wipe.
40447,Elena," So lie, and lie – again, and again, and again."
40448,Caroline," OK. If you want to tell him the truth, I support you 100%, but if you're rushing into this to escape some conflicted feelings over a certain ex who just came back into your life, then I suggest you keep your fangs to yourself."
40449,Elena, Jo.
40450,Jo, Hi.
40451,Elena, Where's Alaric?
40452,Jo, Don't k*ll the messenger. Something about an impromptu guys' weekend.
40453,Elena," You can't miss Friendsgiving. I mean, Matt and Jeremy are already cleaning up the whole Tripp mess, and Caroline's mom has to work. We're already low on friends as it is."
40454,Alaric," Well, if it's any consolation, our Thanksgiving was roadside chili."
40455,Stefan, Hey. Were you invited to Friendsgiving?
40456,Damon, Of course. Caroline demanded I bring string beans.
40457,Stefan, Huh.
40458,Damon, Why? Were you not invited?
40459,Stefan, Nope.
40460,Damon," Ooh, boy. You messed with the wrong girl's feelings. Heh heh."
40461,Elena," What do you mean Bonnie's in the prison world? Damon said that she wasn't there, that she found peace with... Why didn't he tell me this?"
40462,Damon, Why wouldn't I consult you in a decision that might permanently change your life? Hmm. I wonder.
40463,Alaric," He didn't want to get your hopes up. He honestly thought Bonnie died trying to free him. If she sent her Teddy bear over, it could mean she's still..."
40464,Elena," Bonnie's still alive? Oh, my God!"
40465,Alaric," Yeah. So we're in Portland right now, trying to track down some Gemini thing."
40466,Damon, Ascendant.
40467,Elena, This is amazing.
40468,Stefan," Alaric, you might want to keep the news to yourself. I tracked this lead months ago. It was a dead end."
40469,Alaric, Stefan sends his love.
40470,Elena, Wait. What...
40471,Caroline, Bonnie's alive?
40472,Alaric, Is that the reason Caroline assigned me the turkey and the Cranberries. Stefan wasn't invited.
40473,Damon, See what you did? Now we're pulling your weight. I really hope you figure this out before Christmas.
40474,Stefan," Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're both finding amusement in this."
40475,Damon," Why don't you just date her, put us all out of our misery?"
40476,Stefan, Because I don't think about her that way. She's my friend.
40477,Damon," Who would make a great girlfriend. Look. One, she's hot – objectively."
40478,Alaric," Two, she puts up with you."
40479,Damon," Big plus. Three, very, very well organized."
40480,Stefan, Organizational k*ll?
40481,Damon," There are no drawbacks to this woman, Stefan."
40482,Alaric," ( to Damon ) Eh, she did sleep with you."
40483,Damon, See? Another plus.
40484,Stefan, Oh! Look. We're here. Behold the Gemini Coven exactly how it looked 4 months ago.
40485,Kai, Ah. Memories.
40486,Kai," Pitter-patter of little siblings' feet, witchy-woo, chanting in the air, mom and dad calling me an abomination."
40487,Bonnie, Why did you want to come back here?
40488,Kai," Because I can finally show it to someone. My coven goes out of their way to make sure no one finds us, but since they're not here to be paranoid freak shows, mi casa es su casa. Come on."
40489,Stefan," Like I said, uh, 3,000 miles ago, it's not here. Can we, uh, go home now, please?"
40490,Alaric, You know what? Check the GPS again. Just because we don't see anything doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
40491,Damon, Not unlike Caroline's feelings for Stefan.
40492,Stefan, Hilarious. Keep them coming.
40493,Damon," Oh, no. Is Stefan feeling sensitive about ruining his friendship with Caroline? She really liked him, and he broke her heart."
40494,Alaric," See, Stefan? Even the bear knew."
40495,Damon," ( Ms. Cuddles voice ) I saw that from a mile away, and my brain's made of cotton."
40496,Stefan, Give me this.
40497,Damon," Ms. Cuddles, one – invisible creepy mansion, zero."
40498,Liv, Where do you want the stuffing?
40499,Tyler," Well, hello to you, too."
40500,Jo, I'll take that. Hi. I'm Jo. You look... have we met before?
40501,Liv," Liv, and no, but you're dating my Occult Studies professor, which I guess somehow earned you an invite for Thanksgiving dinner."
40502,Jo," Nice to meet you, too."
40503,Tyler, Where's Luke?
40504,Liv, He's outside testing a new filter on his phone. He's making me this stupid retrospective video for our birthday. Twenty-two. Go us.
40505,Elena," Liam, hey. You're here."
40506,Liam," Bearing the white wine of surrender. I owe you an apology. I checked Lady Whitmore's medical records again, and everything was normal, which I would have known if I had double-checked them before making accusations that were unfounded, baseless, dickish. Is that enough adjectives?"
40507,Elena, ( smiling ) Getting there.
40508,Jo," ( to the wine ) Am I glad to see you. ( to Liam ) You, too, Liam."
40509,Elena, ( to Liam ) Come on.
40510,Elena, Would you mind?
40511,Liam, Yeah.
40512,Elena, Thanks.
40513,Elena," Hey. Um, did you..."
40514,Jo, Risk my career switching Lady Whitmore's medical chart? I'm glad it worked.
40515,Elena, Yeah. Thank you.
40516,Stefan, Anybody want to take a stab at how Bonnie's Teddy bear undid whatever was cloaking this place?
40517,Damon, He said without laughing.
40518,Alaric, Jo told me she got rid of her magic by putting it away for safekeeping. Maybe Bonnie put her magic away in this.
40519,Stefan, Why would Bonnie put her magic in Ms. Cuddles?
40520,Damon, To keep Kai from using her to get out.
40521,Alaric, Can't say I miss that.
40522,Damon," It's all yours, brother."
40523,Kai," That smells great. Not exactly a turkey dinner, but it's what my family had in the fridge on May 10, 1994."
40524,Kai, Don't touch that.
40525,Bonnie, ( laughing ) Your pager? Why?
40526,Kai," Because it's brand-new, looks cool, and I don't want you to bust it."
40527,Bonnie," Listen, Kai. My magic's gone, which means we will be stuck here forever. Why don't we just divide the world in half and go our separate ways?"
40528,Kai," I get it. I knocked you out, kidnapped you against your will. Can't you see I'm trying to apologize?"
40529,Bonnie," I will never trust you or like you or enjoy your company for so much as one second, so just quit trying. Just let me leave here unharmed."
40530,Kai, Fine. Can we at least have one last dinner conversation before my eternity of aloneness resumes?
40531,Bonnie," So you agree? One last dinner, and then we peacefully go our separate ways."
40532,Kai," In the spirit of Thanksgiving, I'll even let you take my car."
40533,Bonnie, How can I help?
40534,Caroline," All right! If everyone could gather around the table at their assigned seats, then, um..."
40535,Luke, Oh. Sorry I'm late.
40536,Caroline," ( continuing ) We will each share something that we are thankful for in 100 words or less, so..."
40537,Tyler," Do you want a drink? Once we sit, there's a good chance Caroline won't let anyone get up."
40538,Liv, I'm not really in the mood.
40539,Tyler, Did I do something to piss you off?
40540,Liv," No, Tyler. You didn't."
40541,Luke," Uh, anyone want to see some embarrassing baby videos of Liv?"
40542,Caroline, Oh. You know what? Now would actually be an excellent time just to shut down anything with an on-off button.
40543,Caroline, ( sarcastically ) No. Please let the food get cold. Whatever that is is far more important.
40544,Woman, Happy Birthday! Wave to me!
40545,Children," Hi, Josie."
40546,Woman, How old are you?
40547,Children, Four.
40548,Woman, How do you add that? You guys want to do some numbers? OK. What's one plus one?
40549,Children, Two!
40550,Woman, Two plus two?
40551,Children, Four!
40552,Woman, Nice.
40553,Jo, What are you watching?
40554,Elena, That kind of sounds like your voice.
40555,Jo, That is my voice. I took that video 18 years ago at a birthday party for the twins.
40556,Liv," Oh, my God."
40557,Jo, Lukas and Olivia?
40558,Luke, Jo as in Josette?
40559,Elena, Hang on. You guys know each other?
40560,Jo, I'm their sister.
40561,Alaric," Jo lived here. There's a drawer inside full of stuff, newspaper articles about Jo's medical clamp, pictures of her as a kid, pictures of her as a teenager."
40562,Damon," Hold, please. Rewind. That's Kai from planet 1994."
40563,Stefan, Wait. Jo is his sister?
40564,Damon," Either that, or they both have a thing for Cosby sweaters."
40565,Joshua, I didn't know I had guests. You've met Kai?
40566,Damon," Met him? Watched him die, watched him come back to life. Why? You know him?"
40567,Joshua, Yeah. He's my son. I'm Joshua Parker.
40568,Damon, Damon Salvatore.
40569,Joshua, Invisique.
40570,Stefan, What the hell just happened?
40571,Alaric, I don't know.
40572,Damon, What's wrong with you guys?
40573,Joshua," They can't see you anymore, Damon, which means they also can't see this."
40574,Damon, Ohh! No!
40575,Caroline," So if you don't know each other, then how did you all just happen to end up at the same tiny liberal arts school?"
40576,Jo, We had a family friend here... Sheila Bennett.
40577,Elena, You knew Bonnie's grams?
40578,Jo, She took me under her wing. She also helped my family put Kai away.
40579,Elena, Kai? Wh... Kai as in Damon's Kai?
40580,Jo," As in our brother, my twin."
40581,Caroline, There are two sets of twins in your family?
40582,Luke," Yeah, there were until my coven put Kai in a prison world."
40583,Liv, Now there's just Luke and me.
40584,Liam, I'm sorry. Did you say coven?
40585,Elena," Oh, my God. Liam... ( looks significantly at Liv and Luke ) Is still here."
40586,Tyler," I think he meant ""oven""."
40587,Elena, Yeah.
40588,Caroline," Oh, look! We don't have a wine opener on the table. ( compelling ) Liam, you have a wine opener in your room. Why don't you get it? Take your time."
40589,Caroline," As you were saying, you put Kai away?"
40590,Jo," Kai k*ll 4 of our bothers and sisters to make a point, but he was really targeting Lukas and Olivia."
40591,Tyler, Why them?
40592,Jo," Because in our coven, twins are in line to be leaders."
40593,Liv, Hence our lame-ass name... Gemini.
40594,Jo," Kai wanted to be the leader, but that wasn't possible if Lukas and Olivia were alive."
40595,Jo (V.O.), So I protected them with magic.
40596,Jo (V.O.), Which just pissed him off more.
40597,Kai, Where are they?
40598,Jo (V.O.)," My brother was born without his own magic. He can only draw it from others. It made him feel like a freak. My parents saw him acting out, isolating himself, and they realized that he'd never be capable of leading our coven, so they kept having children until another set of twins were born."
40599,Jo (V.O.)," Kai figured it out, and he snapped."
40600,Kai, Where are they?!
40601,Jo, Run!
40602,Joshua, Just need some information. Not looking to make enemies.
40603,Damon," Funny way of showing it, buddy."
40604,Joshua, You were trapped with Kai. I need to know how you got out.
40605,Damon," Ohh. Strangest months of my life. That whole repeating the same day thing, phew, disconcerting."
40606,Joshua, Is Kai still there?
40607,Damon," Yeah he is, with my friend Bonnie, which leads me to why I'm here."
40608,Joshua, Does Kai know how to escape?
40609,Damon," Look. I'll tell you everything you want to know, but first, I need something from you. It's round, about yea big, a bunch of little gears and wheels and things. It's a lot harder to describe than I thought."
40610,Joshua, The Ascendant.
40611,Damon, Yeah. You know it. Where is it?
40612,Joshua, Why would I give you the key to my son's prison?
40613,Damon, Because I'll say please?
40614,Joshua," Do you have any idea what it feels like to come home and find 4 of your children dead, another one impaled, two running for their lives? Do you think that image has ever left my mind?"
40615,Liv," He was a psychopath, so they sent him away. Kai went to his prison, Jo dodged a b*llet, and now the leadership falls on us."
40616,Caroline," OK. Well, now that we've all gotten to know each other a little bit better, could someone please pass the dinner rolls?"
40617,Liv," Sorry that my family drama isn't appropriate dinner conversation, Caroline."
40618,Caroline, That's not what I meant. It's...
40619,Tyler, Liv...
40620,Liv, Just... Leave me alone.
40621,Elena," OK. I think I may have missed something. If you and Liv can both be the leaders of your coven, why did she just get so upset?"
40622,Luke," Because there aren't two leaders, are there, Jo?"
40623,Jo," In our coven's tradition, after their 22nd birthday, the twins merge their strength. The stronger one wins, absorbing their twin's power, and the weaker of the two..."
40624,Tyler, The weaker of the two what?
40625,Luke, The weaker one dies.
40626,Tyler, Caroline's out looking for you. She wanted to apologize. [b*at] Why didn't you tell me?
40627,Liv, What? That my coven requires my brother and me to merge when we turn 22? Because that's not totally screwed up.
40628,Tyler," You're talking to a guy with a gene that turns him into a wolf. Look. If you don't want to merge, then don't. Your coven doesn't control you."
40629,Liv, My coven needs a leader. You don't understand that because you're not one of us. You're not even supposed to be in my life.
40630,Tyler, Let me help you.
40631,Liv," You can't help me. Why do you think I'm trying to get rid of you? When I look at you... I feel everything I don't get to have. I either die in the merge, or I get to live with the fact that I k*ll my own brother. So tell me, Tyler, how can you help with that?"
40632,Damon," So when you say merge, you don't actually mean merge, do you?"
40633,Joshua," That's exactly what I mean. If Kai gets out, he'll head straight for Jo. His ability to siphon magic will overwhelm Jo, and she will die, and our coven will be left to the whims of a madman."
40634,Damon," Which is now moot thanks to Blond and Blonder, thank goodness. Look. Let's talk about this Ascendant."
40635,Joshua," I won't let him out, Damon."
40636,Damon," All right. I wasn't gonna say anything because you're his dad and all, but if he gets out, I'll just k*ll him. It's that simple."
40637,Joshua," I've watched Jo her whole life. She's done well on her own, survived w*r, become a doctor, but if Jo merges with Kai, she will cease to exist. Kai won't just be our coven's problem. He'll be everyone's problem."
40638,Alaric, I think I met your dad.
40639,Jo," Well, that's improbable considering he lives in Portland."
40640,Alaric," Believe it or not, I'm actually in Portland."
40641,Jo," Ric, you need to tell me what's going on right now."
40642,Elena," Damon's gone, as in into thin air?"
40643,Stefan, Oop. Careful. You just sounded genuinely concerned for my brother.
40644,Elena, I don't have feelings for him anymore. That doesn't mean I want him to blink out of existence.
40645,Stefan, He didn't. It's some sort of cloaking spell. Alaric's on the phone with Jo trying to figure out how to break it.
40646,Elena," And to think we could have all been sitting around stuffed, playing board games."
40647,Stefan," So just to be clear, Jo was invited to Friendsgiving, but I wasn't."
40648,Elena," Friend code states that in matters such as yours and Caroline's I must, with no exception, take the side of my best friend."
40649,Stefan, Huh.
40650,Elena, Can you two just kiss and make up? It's getting weird.
40651,Stefan, You're just mad because no one knew how to carve the turkey.
40652,Elena, ( to Stefan ) How did you know that you could trust me?
40653,Stefan, Trust you with what?
40654,Elena, When you were honest with me about what you were. How did you know that you could trust me with such a huge secret?
40655,Stefan, That's easy. I was in love with you. I wanted you to know everything. [b*at] You owe me dinner.
40656,Jo," Ric, listen to me. If my dad knows that you want to open Kai's world, he'll think you're going to free him. He's going to retaliate."
40657,Joshua, Phesmatos incendere ad pulvox.
40658,Damon, What the hell are you doing?
40659,Jo," And I hate to break it to you, Ric, but you traveled 3,000 miles for nothing. The Ascendant's with me."
40660,Alaric," You got to be kidding me, right?"
40661,Elena, Jo? Are you OK?
40662,Jo, Something's wrong.
40663,Alaric, Jo?
40664,Elena," Jo, what's wrong?"
40665,Jo, I think my dad...
40666,Elena," Jo, what the hell is going on?"
40667,Jo, My dad's trying to k*ll me.
40668,Liam, What the hell is she talking about? Her dad's trying to k*ll her?
40669,Alaric (V.O.)," Jo, Jo, answer the phone."
40670,Elena, Ric?
40671,Alaric," Elena, what the hell's going on?"
40672,Elena, Something's happening to Jo. You have to find her dad and stop him from whatever he's doing to her.
40673,Stefan," Well, that's gonna be problem because even if we could see the house I haven't been invited in."
40674,Elena, Invite him in.
40675,Jo, You can come in!
40676,Alaric, But we can't even see the damn house.
40677,Jo, They need magic!
40678,Jo, Crap.
40679,Liam," Elena, we have to do something. Definite signs of hemoptysis."
40680,Jo," Shut up, Liam. ( to Elena ) Ask them if they see an old tree stump in the front yard?"
40681,Stefan," Yeah, I see it."
40682,Jo, Go there now!
40683,Kai, Mmm. Mmm.
40684,Bonnie, Really? You've been eating that same piece for 45 minutes.
40685,Kai, Is it a crime to want to savor our last meal together?
40686,Bonnie, I had Thanksgiving dinner with you. Now you keep up your end of the deal and give me your car keys.
40687,Kai, I should probably teach you how the clutch works. It's finicky.
40688,Bonnie, Quit stalling and give me your keys.
40689,Kai, Fine. I'm stalling. Mmm. But don't you want to hear how my story ends?
40690,Bonnie," I've read the newspaper. You m*rder your siblings, and your coven sent you to live in this prison world."
40691,Kai," My family sent me to this prison world. My father, the great coven leader... he treated me like crap for 22 years and then locked me here. It's like his... like his kids didn't even matter. Coven always came first no matter what."
40692,Joshua," If Kai has access to an Ascendant and is sharing his prison with the Bennett witch, he will eventually find his way out. At least, this will keep him from merging."
40693,Damon, You're just gonna take out Jo?
40694,Joshua, The coven comes before family.
40695,Stefan, What the hell are we gonna do with a kn*fe?
40696,Alaric, Maybe it's Jo's version of Ms. Cuddles.
40697,Alaric, Nice sh*t.
40698,Joshua, Invisique.
40699,Stefan," Well, I guess the, uh, disappearing act's their shtick."
40700,Damon, Yeah. Hey. Anybody hear from Jo?
40701,Liam, You need to tell me what's going on.
40702,Elena, You have to get more ice.
40703,Liam," I'm not an idiot, Elena. I know you're lying to me, so whatever it is, just tell me, please."
40704,Elena, She's crashing!
40705,Liam," Dr. Laughlin, look at me."
40706,Elena," Jo, can you hear me? Jo!"
40707,Liam," Come on, Dr. Laughlin. Please wake up. ( to Elena ) Check for dilation."
40708,Liam, Holy crap. What the... what happened to her?
40709,Elena, I don't know.
40710,Liam, Call 9-1-1. I'll start CPR.
40711,Liam," Call 9-1-1, Elena. We need help. She's about to die."
40712,Elena," Liam... Liam, there's not enough time."
40713,Liam, What are you doing?
40714,Liam," Elena, your face."
40715,Elena, It's OK. My bl*od will heal her.
40716,Elena, Jo?
40717,Jo, I'm OK.
40718,Elena, I'll get you some water.
40719,Liam," Elena. Elena, stop! How did you do that? How did you do that?!"
40720,Elena, I'm a vampire.
40721,Liam, You're what?
40722,Elena," It doesn't matter, because as much as I like you, my life is complicated enough. ( compelling ) So you're not gonna remember anything from tonight or about Lady Whitmore or the fact that we even dated at all. You're gonna go home, get some rest, and I'll see you at work on Monday."
40723,Liam," I'll see you Monday, Elena."
40724,Kai," Olivia, Lukas?"
40725,Kai," Olivia? Lukas? Come out, come out, wherever you are."
40726,Jo, Stop! I'll do it. I'll merge with you. Just don't hurt anyone else.
40727,Bonnie, So Jo agreed to the merge?
40728,Kai," Well, we needed a celestial event, so the plan was to use the power of the eclipse happening the next day. She even gathered our coven to help."
40729,Jo, The power of the eclipse will merge us as one. You know what to say?
40730,Kai, Been practicing my whole life.
40731,Jo & Kai (together), Sanguinem desimilus... Sanguinem generis fiantus.
40732,Kai, I don't feel anything.
40733,Kai, ( alone ) Sanguinem desimilus... Sanguinem generis fiantus.
40734,Kai," Josette, what did you do? Why can't I feel your magic? And why aren't they saying anything? They should be saying something. They should be saying something, right? We're merging. This should all be a bigger deal."
40735,Joshua," Sanguinem filio, sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum. Sanguinem filio, sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum."
40736,Kai, Aah! Aah!
40737,Joshua," Phesmatos filio, phesmatos effurgarex perpetuum."
40738,Kai," They tricked me good. Instead of using the power of the eclipse for the merge, my dad used it to send me here, and where'd Jo's magic go? You know, it made zero sense. Magic doesn't just, like, disappear, but then you made yours disappear when you hid it in Ms. Cuddles, and it hit me. My sneaky little twin sister hid her magic..."
40739,Kai, In this. Hmm.
40740,Bonnie, Still there.
40741,Kai, Still here and still full of magic.
40742,Kai," Well, it was. I just sucked it out."
40743,Bonnie, You have magic again. Good for you.
40744,Kai, I also have the Ascendant.
40745,Bonnie, Doesn't matter. You need a Bennett witch to do the spell.
40746,Kai, About that. I've watched you do the spell twice now. I don't think I need a Bennett witch to do the spell. I think all I actually need is Bennett bl*od.
40747,Damon," All right. So let's just get this straight. We went to the airport, we took off all our clothes for security just so I can come out here, have my brain scrambled by papa Kai, who by the way can disappear into thin air... Poof... only to find Jo's rusty kn*fe full of magic."
40748,Stefan," And we learned that the Ascendant, i.e. the only reason we flew our asses out here in the first place, is actually with Jo at Whitmore, 5 minutes from where we started. Great."
40749,Alaric, Jo said she kept it with her to ensure that Kai would never be released.
40750,Damon, Genius. Great. Then we go home. g*n. Come on.
40751,Alaric," Guys, hey. We can't do this, OK? We need to find another way, and one that doesn't end up with my girlfriend dead."
40752,Damon," Girlfriend? You've been on, like, 3 dates."
40753,Stefan," Nice, Damon."
40754,Damon," What? I'm just saying he barely knows her, and her literal evil twin is over there with Bonnie right now."
40755,Alaric," Guys, I will do what I can to help, but we're not letting her brother out, all right? The Ascendant is off the table."
40756,Damon," OK. Get the Ascendant from Jo. Do whatever you got to do to get it, you understand?"
40757,Alaric, I understand.
40758,Stefan, What are you doing?
40759,Damon, What? You got a better idea?
40760,Tyler, Good morning.
40761,Liv, Where am I?
40762,Tyler," You passed out, so I brought you home."
40763,Liv, You kidnapped me? Romantic.
40764,Tyler," I am protecting you, Liv. I'm not letting you sacrifice yourself because your coven needs a leader."
40765,Liv, They'll come after me.
40766,Tyler," Let them. Magic doesn't work in Mystic Falls, so if your coven wants to find you, they'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. They'll have to go through me."
40767,Liv, I'm sorry I ruined Thanksgiving.
40768,Tyler," You'll make up for it next year. We'll find another way, Liv. I'm not going to let you die."
40769,Stefan, Hey.
40770,Caroline," Hey. You're here. That's good. That actually saves me a trip. Needless to say, there were leftovers."
40771,Stefan, You made me a doggie bag.
40772,Caroline," ( laughing ) Just because I hate you doesn't mean I want you to starve to death. Besides, Bonnie's alive. You know, this is, like, the first Thanksgiving in forever where there's something to actually be thankful for, so..."
40773,Stefan," Caroline, um, look. When Damon was gone, I, um... I pushed you away."
40774,Caroline," Yeah, I know, Stefan. You pushed everyone away. It's kind of what you do."
40775,Stefan," But I pushed you away the most. I knew that you were the one person who would sit with me and let me cry, and I didn't want to cry anymore, so I had to push you away the most."
40776,Caroline, Thank you for saying that.
40777,Stefan, Listen...
40778,Caroline, Enjoy the leftovers.
40779,Elena," You should have brought me with you. Well, first, you should have told me that Bonnie was alive, and then you should have brought me with you."
40780,Damon," Well, Ric had more frequent flyer miles, and Ric didn't deliberately forget our entire relationship."
40781,Elena, Yeah. I deserve that.
40782,Damon, Mm-hmm.
40783,Elena, So you and Bonnie spent the last 4 months together?
40784,Damon, Yeah.
40785,Elena, What did you do?
40786,Damon," Bicker, mostly. Cooked, ate. We went through a Tetris phase, but I b*at it, and she got mad. ( Elena laughs ) We talked. A lot. Apparently there are a lot of words in the English language, and Bonnie knows just about all of them."
40787,Elena," Yep. I know this is gonna sound pretty strange, but I'm really happy that the two of you had each other."
40788,Damon," She sacrificed herself so I could come back. Hmm. Wow. Because when she wasn't talking, she was listening. She listened for hours and hours and hours, so when the opportunity presented itself for me to come back, she made sure I took it."
40789,Elena, What did you talk about?
40790,Damon, What do you think?
40791,Elena, I broke up with Liam.
40792,Damon, Dr. Future-Humanitarian-Award wasn't good enough? What went wrong?
40793,Elena," What do you think? Look. I'm at a crossroads right now, where I could go live my life the way I think I probably should and be successful and safe and probably very happy, or I could risk all that for this tiny glimmer of a feeling inside that I just can't shake."
40794,Damon," Well, Robert Frost, what's it gonna be?"
40795,Elena, I don't know... But I do know someone who could give me some pretty sound advice.
40796,Elena," Any chance you'd be willing to help me bring my best friend Bonnie back? So, I could ask her?"
40797,Damon, Sure.
40798,Bonnie, What?
40799,Bonnie," ""I lied""?"
40800,Bonnie, There's no car. The bastard took the car.
40801,Elena," I get that we had an amazing life together, but now I feel like I'm looking at a stranger."
40802,Kai," To get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse, using an Ascendant."
40803,Elena, What about Bonnie?
40804,Damon, She sacrificed herself so I could come back.
40805,Stefan, Jo is his sister?
40806,Jo," In our coven, Kai wanted to be the leader, but that wasn't if Lukas and Olivia were alive."
40807,Tyler, I'm not gonna let you die.
40808,Joshua," If Kai gets out, he'll head straight for Jo. His ability to siphon magic will overwhelm Jo, and our coven will be left to the whims of a madman."
40809,Kai," To do the spell, all I need is Bennett bl*od."
40810,Bonnie, The bastard took the car.
40811,Jo, The Ascendant's with me.
40812,Alaric," We're not letting her brother out, all right?"
40813,Alaric, The Ascendant is off the table.
40814,Damon, Ok. Get the Ascendant from Jo.
40815,Alaric, I understand.
40816,Elena, Look. I'm at a crossroads. Any chance you'd be willing to help me bring my best friend Bonnie back?
40817,Damon, Sure.
40818,Jo, Knock knock.
40819,Alaric, Hey. Come on in.
40820,Jo, Oh. It's one of those nights.
40821,Alaric," Oh, wow. Your enthusiasm is amazing."
40822,Jo," I'm sorry. I've had a day from hell, and I didn't mean it. I did actually, but I'm gonna call take backs, ok?"
40823,Alaric, Ok.
40824,Jo," Ooh, you got Thai food."
40825,Alaric," You know, I knew I should have led with the food."
40826,Jo," Well, this is perfect. I'm starving."
40827,Jo, Aww. Where's yours?
40828,Alaric, Oh. Very funny.
40829,Stefan, You didn't compel him to get her drunk.
40830,Damon," No. I compelled him to do whatever it takes, and considering the Ascendant is the key to her psycho brother's weird prison world, I'm sure it's gonna take her a few to open up about it."
40831,Alaric, I swear your dad loves me. Ha ha ha! I have never been given so clear a blessing.
40832,Jo," You went to see him, and he tried to k*ll me. How's that a blessing?"
40833,Alaric, Because he didn't try to k*ll me. He just banished me from your creepy childhood home.
40834,Jo," It wasn't creepy back then. Once your brother brutally m*rder your siblings, creep sets in."
40835,Alaric, Oh. So you just... you just ran.
40836,Jo, I didn't run. They let me go. We made a deal. Betray your brother and get your freedom.
40837,Alaric, So where does the Ascendant fall under this deal?
40838,Jo, They didn't know I had it.
40839,Alaric," By the time I found out, I was gone."
40840,Alaric, I still don't understand why you'd want it.
40841,Jo," It makes me feel safe, like I'm in control. As long as I have it, then no one can use it to get Kai out. Kai can't get me. Embarrassing, but I actually used sleep with it under my pillow."
40842,Alaric, Used to?
40843,Jo," Yes, used to. I am a grownup now obviously, and I keep it in my underwear drawer, next to my pot."
40844,Alaric," Oh, ok. Well, that explains why you're always hungry."
40845,Jo, No. I'm always hungry because I'm a vegetarian.
40846,Alaric, Ok.
40847,Alaric, Well... The last of it.
40848,Jo, Good. No more distractions.
40849,Stefan, You realize he is gonna k*ll you when he finds out what you did to him.
40850,Damon," My relationship to ruin, thank you. I didn't complain when you ruined yours with Caroline."
40851,Stefan, I didn't ruin my...
40852,Damon," Yeah. I'm sure she's fine. She's on vacation with her mom, eating ice cream out of the carton, convincing herself she never liked you in the first place."
40853,Stefan, You done?
40854,Damon," Careful, Stefan. I know it may seem easy to be the big bad Salvatore, but soon, you'll find yourself lying in the middle of the road, pouring your heart out to a stranger, having an existential crisis."
40855,Stefan," Yeah, great. So, uh, when's this grand theft gonna happen?"
40856,Damon," Assuming everything went well, it's already happened, which means..."
40857,Alaric, Here it is.
40858,Damon," Thanks, buddy."
40859,Damon," There you go. ( compelling ) Go home to Jo, be a good boyfriend, forget this ever happened."
40860,Jeremy," Seriously, I shouldn't be winning."
40861,Elena, Two weeks without booze doesn't make you iron man. I can still vamp circles around you.
40862,Jeremy," You mean, you can cheat."
40863,Elena, Ha! Or I could pants you in front of the entire women's volleyball team.
40864,Jeremy, Doubt they'd mind.
40865,Elena, Ok. I give up. What did you do with my miserable half-drunk brother?
40866,Jeremy," He canceled Bonnie's cell phone, cried until there was nothing left, and got all the grief out of his system. He is ready to move on."
40867,Jeremy, What?
40868,Elena, It's about Bonnie.
40869,Jeremy, Damon said she found peace.
40870,Elena," He thought Kai had k*ll her, but he just found out that she's alive, and he's doing everything that he can to..."
40871,Jeremy, So you're back to defending him. Wow! And all it took was one hollow promise to bring Bonnie back.
40872,Elena," No. No, no, no, Jer. It's not hollow. Liv's looking for a way to send us over there so that we can find Bonnie and bring her back."
40873,Jeremy, And if you can't?
40874,Elena," Jer, this is good news."
40875,Jeremy," You're right, Elena. This is good news. Tonight, I'm gonna see Bonnie again, and everything is gonna go back to the way it was because I have never heard that before."
40876,Tyler, I brought you to Mystic Falls to keep you safe from your crazy-ass witch family. You can't just leave because Damon wants you to do some spell.
40877,Liv," So, what, I'm a prisoner here? Do I look like Rapunzel?"
40878,Tyler," Well, actually... Look. Why can't Luke do it?"
40879,Liv," Because he is busy enjoying his last few weeks as a singular twin with his sugar daddy radiologist, and I'd like to enjoy mine."
40880,Tyler," Matt, help me out here."
40881,Matt, I can't. It's for Bonnie.
40882,Liv," Tyler, I can't stay locked up in here any longer. I'm out of clothes, and I've had pizza for breakfast every day this week. We've got to get back to our normal lives."
40883,Tyler, If you leave and your coven finds you...
40884,Liv," They'll make me merge with my brother? Hey. It's not all bad. If I survive, you'll be dating the all-powerful leader of the Gemini coven, and if I don't, you can date Luke."
40885,Tyler," Hey. This isn't a joke to me, ok?"
40886,Liv," Well, I have to laugh at it because if I start imagining my life stuck in this town running away from my family, I will fall apart."
40887,Tyler, I'll find a way.
40888,Sarah, And that was an actual fight two people just had over a twin-merge? This town is so weird.
40889,Matt, You'll get used to it.
40890,Sarah," Or I won't, and a vampire will k*ll me like they k*ll your friend Tripp."
40891,Matt, That's not gonna happen because I won't let it.
40892,Matt," And with that, the Mystic Falls community protection program is officially disbanded."
40893,Sarah," You know what that means. I helped you, now you help me. Time for a little family reunion."
40894,Elena, What does Matt want with Stefan?
40895,Damon," I don't know. It's Matt. Food, money, new social class. Whatever it is, it better distract Stefan from his sizeable screw-up with Caroline. Did you know about that, how she felt about him?"
40896,Elena," She told me a little while back, and whatever you're thinking, I want both of them to be happy."
40897,Damon, Even if she compels away all the things she likes about him?
40898,Elena, Hey. Thanks for doing this.
40899,Liv, Don't worry about it. I needed an excuse to get out of that frat house. Way too much boy. Gross. You got everything?
40900,Damon, Yep. bl*od from a Bennett - Lucy to be exact - and an Ascendant from whatever the hell your last name is.
40901,Liv, Parker. So this is the famous Ascendant?
40902,Damon, Yup.
40903,Liv, Surprised that Jo gave it up.
40904,Elena, Why?
40905,Liv," It's the only thing keeping Kai locked in his prison. If he gets out, he's coming after Jo."
40906,Damon," Well, good old Jo - heh heh -helping us out. Can we do this, please?"
40907,Liv," Whatever. So I'm gonna need the moon to activate the Ascendant. It will be viable for about 8 hours, so once I send you over, the clock's ticking."
40908,Elena, And how do we get back?
40909,Liv, Drink these.
40910,Damon, What is that?
40911,Liv," It's my bl*od. It will link you to me so I can find you and bring you back. Give this one to Bonnie, too."
40912,Liv, Are you waiting for a toast? Drink.
40913,Damon, Mmm. Bitter. Wonder why. Shall we?
40914,Damon, Hey.
40915,Elena, I used to come here every day after the accident for months.
40916,Damon, This is where your parents are buried.
40917,Elena," Yeah, but not in 1994. In 1994, they were still alive."
40918,Damon, Yeah. So is Bonnie. So let's go get her. Just keep your eyes peeled. There's a pork rind-munching freak somewhere around here. Ok?
40919,Elena, Yeah.
40920,Damon, Come on.
40921,Kai," You ever worn skinny jeans? Agh. It seems wrong. I'm all bunched up. Also, why are jeans so tight when phones are so big?"
40922,Driver," I don't know what to tell you, pal."
40923,Kai," Oh, God. I'm that guy, right? That guy that won't shut up. Oh, I hate that guy. I just sat next to that guy on the plane. He was the worst. Hey. Speaking of planes, have you flown recently? Because what's with the whole liquid situation and the stripping before you go through security thing? It's weird."
40924,Driver, They're worried about t*rrorists.
40925,Kai," Ok. Well, I'm sorry, but the real t*rrorists are some of those people taking off their shoes. I know I'm chatty. Sorry. I've just been in prison for awhile. Not like a regular prison, you know, more like a..."
40926,Driver, All right. We're here.
40927,Kai, Special kind of...
40928,Driver, That will be 30.
40929,Kai," All right. Jeans. Uh, will you take this? Hang on. Hang on. I got it. Oh. Hey. Gum. Nice."
40930,Driver," Come on, buddy. I don't have all day. Let's go."
40931,Kai, I got it. Hold on. Huh. Well... I guess this will do.
40932,Kai, Thank you.
40933,Elena, Bonnie?
40934,Damon, Nothing. You?
40935,Elena," No, and I looked in every room plus the basement."
40936,Elena," Damon, you... you don't think that Kai..."
40937,Damon," Look. Let's not jump to depressing conclusions yet, ok?"
40938,Elena, Ok.
40939,Elena," Oh, my god. Damon."
40940,Elena," Oh, my god, Damon. This is bl*od."
40941,Damon, And we're jumping.
40942,Elena, What are you doing?
40943,Damon," If Kai has Bonnie, we need to talk."
40944,Elena, So you're gonna call him?
40945,Damon, I'm gonna page him actually.
40946,Damon, Sorry. Forgot you were two in 1994.Pagers are an ancient form of telecommunication.
40947,Elena, I know what a pager is. [b*at] How does it work?
40948,Damon, We dial jackass's number 555-HIYA-KAI...
40949,Damon, We leave our number... And then we hang up.
40950,Elena, And now what?
40951,Damon, And now we sit by the phone like a 13-year-old girl and wait.
40952,Matt, Relax.
40953,Sarah, I'm about to meet one of my only living relatives.
40954,Enzo," Uh, technically, he's not living. So Stefan has extended family. I'm intrigued."
40955,Matt," Enzo, what the hell are you doing here?"
40956,Enzo," Apparently rescuing this one from the world's most dreadful lunch. Matt and Stefan? Sweetheart, you can do so much better. Me for example. I'm Enzo."
40957,Matt, The guy who k*ll Tripp.
40958,Sarah," Oh, my God."
40959,Enzo," For the record, he did try and k*ll me first. ( to Matt ) You are the most terrible wingman."
40960,Matt," Enzo, leave."
40961,Enzo, Or what?
40962,Matt, Or maybe I'll pick up where Tripp left off.
40963,Enzo, Go on then.
40964,Stefan," Hey. I really wouldn't do that if I were you. You hurt him, and, uh, I hurt you, and really don't feel like cleaning up two corpses today."
40965,Enzo, Making threats in front of impressionable family. How brutish.
40966,Stefan, What are you talking about?
40967,Sarah," Me. He's, uh, talking about me. I'm Zach and Gail's daughter, Sarah Salvatore."
40968,Elena, Um...
40969,Damon ( on video )," Well, I am officially in hell. This place is my own personal hell."
40970,Damon, Whoa!
40971,Elena, Oh. Hey! What was that?
40972,Damon," Uh, it's my audition tape for ""Real World: London."" Fingers crossed. I think I'm finally gonna make it."
40973,Elena, That was a video journal.
40974,Damon," What? No. Journals are lame, especially video ones."
40975,Elena, Then why did you say you thought this was your own personal hell?
40976,Damon," Well, I mean, because I was stuck here with Bonnie. What could be worse than that?"
40977,Elena, Damon.
40978,Damon," Kai, if you so much as hurt one hair on her annoying little witch head, I will k*ll you and..."
40979,Bonnie, That was so sweet. Why'd you ruin it by calling me annoying?
40980,Elena, Bonnie?
40981,Bonnie," Elena? Elena, is that you?"
40982,Elena, Yes! It's me. I'm here. I'm at the Salvatore house in...in 1994.
40983,Bonnie, I can't believe I'm hearing your voice right now. How are you here?
40984,Elena, It's a long story. Just know that I'm here to get you.
40985,Elena, So Kai just left you in Portland?
40986,Bonnie, After cooking me Thanksgiving spaghetti and stealing my bl*od. It's been a strange few days.
40987,Elena, Where is he now?
40988,Bonnie," Don't know. I hotwired a car, and I'm on my way back to Mystic Falls."
40989,Elena, Hang on. You hotwired a car? Who are you?
40990,Bonnie, A badass apparently. A badass in Muncie.
40991,Damon," Well, Muncie's about 6 1/2 hours away, give or take a knuckle."
40992,Elena, Liv's pulling us out in 7.
40993,Damon, If you don't stop to use the little witches' room anymore...
40994,Bonnie, I can make it in time. I'm going home.
40995,Elena, You're coming home. We'll see you soon.
40996,Bonnie, Ok.
40997,Elena, You're worried about Kai.
40998,Damon," If he's got Bonnie's bl*od and the Ascendant, he's got everything he needs to get out. [b*at] What if he's already out?"
40999,Liv, How can I help you?
41000,Kai," One Zima, please."
41001,Liv, Hilarious. ( Kai says nothing ) Are you going to order something or just gonna stare?
41002,Kai," Ok. Uh, how about a soda... ( reads name tag ) Liv?"
41003,Kai, Heh. Liv. Ironic.
41004,Jo, Where is it?
41005,Alaric," That's a cryptic question, accusatory tone. This doesn't bode well for me."
41006,Jo," Good. Deflect, make a joke. That'll fix this."
41007,Alaric, What are you talking about?
41008,Jo, The Ascendant. Where is it?
41009,Alaric, I have no idea.
41010,Jo," You must think I'm an idiot. To be fair, I am one. Wine, Thai food, that's all it takes."
41011,Alaric," Jo, I don't have it."
41012,Jo, Did you tell Damon where it is?
41013,Alaric, No. No. Look. We all agreed to find another way to get Bonnie back. Do you honestly think this is my normal afternoon reading?
41014,Jo, You and I are the only ones who knew where it was. It's gone!
41015,Alaric," Ok. Look. I swear to you I didn't tell anyone, ok? I would never tell anybody."
41016,Jo, You're right. You'd never tell anyone. It doesn't mean you didn't.
41017,Alaric, What are you saying?
41018,Jo, Damon is a vampire.
41019,Alaric, Are you saying Damon compelled me? Heh. Look. He wouldn't do that. He's my friend.
41020,Jo," Ok. Let's prove it. We're going to Mystic Falls. If you're compelled, it will go away when we walk across the border. If nothing happens, then you're right. He's your friend."
41021,Damon, Bon appetit.
41022,Elena, Hang on.
41023,Elena, What?
41024,Damon, Nothing. Let's eat.
41025,Elena, Ok. Who mangled the crossword?
41026,Damon," 6 letters, illiterate witch, B."
41027,Elena, This is about Kai and Jo.
41028,Damon, Yep. Kai's greatest hits staring us in the face every day.
41029,Elena," If Kai's out, he's gonna go after Jo again. Damon, he's gonna k*ll her."
41030,Damon," Well, if I have my Gemini rules down, actually, he's going to merge with her, which will most likely result in her death, which I guess is 6 of 1..."
41031,Elena, Then why would she give you the Ascendant?
41032,Damon, Um... Because I asked her very nicely? You want some music maybe? I'm gonna turn on some music.
41033,Elena," It was the one thing trapping Kai, and she just gave it to you?"
41034,Damon," We have Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Boyz II Men, Stefan's."
41035,Elena, Damon.
41036,Damon, Fine. She didn't give it to me. Alaric stole it from her.
41037,Elena, Alaric stole from her.
41038,Damon, After I compelled him.
41039,Damon," What? Elena, stop."
41040,Elena," Of course you compel your best friend. I mean, why would that be off limits?"
41041,Damon, Hey. I'm trying to get Bonnie back!
41042,Elena," Oh, just, just, no. Don't. Damon, I want Bonnie back more than anything. She's my best friend, but to you, she's something else, isn't she? She's a chance for me to realize what a great guy you are so that I can fall in love with you all over again. It doesn't matter who gets hurt in the process as long as Damon gets what Damon wants."
41043,Enzo," She's saying you're stupid, and Stefan is agreeing. Ooh. Now she's saying you're good for nothing, and Stefan is disagreeing. He says you're a great punch line to a joke."
41044,Matt, Everyone hates you.
41045,Enzo, Don't be jealous you can't vamp hear because you're a big blond bowl of mush. Just be thankful I don't fancy mush.
41046,Sarah," ( to Stefan ) So after the third group home, I got myself emancipated, which is surprisingly difficult, by the way."
41047,Stefan, Yeah. You seem like the type that would do better on your own. Hey. Do you want a drink?
41048,Sarah, Sure.
41049,Stefan," Hey. Excuse me. Can we get two chocolate milk shakes, please? ( to Sarah ) It's a, uh, Salvatore family tradition."
41050,Sarah, I'm all for family traditions.
41051,Stefan," All right. Listen. In 10 seconds, you're gonna get up and walk out of here with me, smiling, acting like nothing's wrong. The acting part shouldn't be too hard for you."
41052,Stefan, I know you're lying.
41053,Stefan, Ready to go?
41054,Matt, Hey. Where you guys going?
41055,Stefan," Oh, just a little family drive."
41056,Sarah," It's ok, Matt, I promise. I'll call you in a bit."
41057,Matt, All right.
41058,Kai," You on Twitter? Ah. I just signed up. You should follow me. Cobrakai1972. Come on. Like ""Karate Kid""? Did you know you can follow celebrities? Heh. They all Twitter the stupidest things. It's... it's hilarious."
41059,Liv, It's kind of dead. I think I'm gonna close up.
41060,Kai," Oh. Hang on, hang on. I'm gonna get a real drink. No bourbon. I'm secure enough in my masculinity. Vodka's boring, rum's too tropical. Ooh. Tequila. You do not want to see me on Tequila. What about gin? Is that weird?"
41061,Liv," Not if you're a 50-year-old, but seeing as you look 19, I'm gonna need to see some I.D."
41062,Kai, Oh. Of course. Of course.
41063,Liv, 1972. Nice try.
41064,Kai," No. True story, but that's not the most interesting thing on that I.D. Here. Look again. Name, address..."
41065,Liv," Malachai Parker. Oh, my God. Ahhh."
41066,Kai, Last time I saw you...
41067,Liv, Aah!
41068,Kai, I was trying to k*ll you. Why don't we pick up where we left off?
41069,Liv, I don't think so.
41070,Kai, Life is so much easier with magic.
41071,Kai," Feels kind of like cheating. I'm sad you didn't recognize me. That means dad erased all trace of my existence... family pictures, movies, little handprint turkey I made. What a dick."
41072,Liv, You stay the hell away from me.
41073,Kai," You were always so bad at hide-and-seek. I mean, you were 4, but still, find a better hiding spot."
41074,Tyler, I think she did just fine. ( to Liv ) Let's get out of here.
41075,Enzo, You don't find it the least bit strange that they just up and left?
41076,Matt," I told you she's his family. If they want to talk, let them talk. What the hell do you care?"
41077,Enzo," Because I care about the truth, care about authenticity."
41078,Matt, Or you just hate Stefan.
41079,Enzo," I do actually, yeah. He abandoned his brother, turned me over to a vampire hunter, and he hurt the one girl who can honestly do no wrong. That's not why I care. No. I care because he does all that and is still considered a hero when I get stuck being a villain."
41080,Matt," Yeah, because you k*ll people."
41081,Enzo," What, and Stefan doesn't? Come on. You and I both know that's not true. I'm just up front about it, but Stefan, no, who knows what he's done? He's just a liar with a little box of secrets. Come on, Mush. Let's open the box."
41082,Sarah," I told you Zach Salvatore is my father, Gail is my mother. I have these pictures."
41083,Stefan," Ah. That's your big evidence, a picture you stole? You gave yourself up the second you got in the car."
41084,Sarah, Why don't you believe me?
41085,Stefan," Because right now, Sarah Salvatore is in her dorm room at Duke university, where she studies as an art major, and she didn't bounce from group home to group home. She was adopted right out of the hospital by a great family. I made sure of it."
41086,Sarah, You know her.
41087,Stefan," She's my family. Even though she doesn't know me, I've looked out for her for her entire life. Now who the hell are you?"
41088,Sarah, Monique. My name is Monique.
41089,Damon," May 10, 1994, I had a day. I was mad at Stefan for something. I don't even remember what it was, and in typical Damon fashion, I acted out. People died. A lot of them, and believe it or not, ever since that day, I've felt horribly guilty. So I thought that this was my hell, Elena... But you know who didn't? Bonnie. She had hope for both of us. She's the reason I survived, the reason I made it out. Who knew? Turns out you spend time with someone and don't k*ll them, you actually become friends. I'm doing this for Bonnie, Elena, not for you. And that's it."
41090,Elena, Damon and Bonnie. Who would have thought?
41091,Damon, Pfft. Don't make this any weirder than it needs to be.
41092,Elena, She's probably passing Whitmore right now.
41093,Damon, If she's not lost. She has a terrible sense of direction.
41094,Elena," You know, I could have sworn that this used to squeak."
41095,Damon," It did. I fixed it. Bonnie and I came here every day. It was the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get."
41096,Elena," It's funny. I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I b*rned it down. I just couldn't bear to look at it again. I just can't believe it's gone."
41097,Damon, You want to go inside?
41098,Elena," Yeah. Yeah, I do."
41099,Elena, I'm sorry I compelled away the memories. They were only half mine.
41100,Damon, We'll make new ones.
41101,Elena, Do you feel that?
41102,Damon," Oh, no."
41103,Elena," No. No. We shouldn't be back yet. Damon, we have another hour."
41104,Elena, What did you do?
41105,Tyler, Kai is here. We have to get back to Mystic Falls before he takes any more of her magic.
41106,Elena, No. Send me back first.
41107,Liv, I can't.
41108,Elena, Bonnie was on her way. Send me back!
41109,Damon," Elena, you're over the border."
41110,Tyler," I'm sorry, Elena."
41111,Elena, No. No.
41112,Monique," I met Sarah at sleep-away camp, or as my foster family liked to call it, get the hell out of my house camp. Sarah had a great life. Me? Not so much. So when I found out that she had no desire to find her real family..."
41113,Stefan, You decided to find them for her.
41114,Monique, Couldn't be any worse than what I had.
41115,Stefan," Well, considering the fact that my brother k*ll her mom while she was pregnant, I don't know about that. I let him believe that the baby died. I wanted to protect her. Even though my brother's not the same person he was before, it's safer if he doesn't know. I know that may be a little bit extreme, but I want her to have a normal life no matter what. See, the problem is with you around, there's a threat now, someone who knows her other than me."
41116,Stefan, I'm not gonna hurt you. I just need you to take off your Vervain.
41117,Stefan," ( compelling ) You've never met or heard of Sarah Salvatore. Forget everything that happened here, leave Virginia, and never come back."
41118,Matt, Hey! You ok?
41119,Monique, Who are you?
41120,Matt, You compelled her? Why?
41121,Stefan," She's not my family, she's a con artist, and I'm just trying to get rid of her. ( to Monique ) Get out of here."
41122,Monique, Aah! What the hell?
41123,Enzo," ( compelling ) No screaming, luv, and don't move."
41124,Matt," Enzo, what are you doing?"
41125,Enzo," I want the whole story, the one not obscured by the dulcet tones of a blender."
41126,Stefan, I told you she's a con artist. There is no Sarah Salvatore. That baby died when Damon k*ll her mom.
41127,Enzo," Then why listen to this one babble on for 20 minutes, why whisk her away to speak privately, hmm? Why wipe her memory, Stefan? She knows something."
41128,Stefan, Come on. Don't do this. Just let her go.
41129,Enzo," See? He's digging in. Can always spot a liar. How about a countdown? That's fair for everyone, right? 5 seconds. 4...3..."
41130,Matt," Enzo, let her go, or I swear..."
41131,Enzo, You'll what?
41132,Matt, I will k*ll you.
41133,Enzo, Will you? Because Stefan's 5 seconds are up.
41134,Matt, No!
41135,Stefan, Don't be stupid. Don't be stupid.
41136,Enzo, Just think. All of this could have been avoided if you'd have just told the truth. No matter. I'll find out sooner or later.
41137,Elena," Bonnie's gonna get to the house, and we will be gone."
41138,Damon," Until the next comet, or full moon, or eclipse. As long as we have that, we can go back as many times as we need until we get her back."
41139,Kai," Wait. Are you guys talking about Bonnie Bennett? Because honestly, I didn't think she was all that great."
41140,Elena, No!
41141,Damon, I am gonna enjoy the hell out of this.
41142,Kai," Oh, hey. Me, too. Oh, yeah. Damon, I, uh, I stole some of Liv's magic when I tried to k*ll her. Think some of it might still be in my system, so pardon me."
41143,Kai, Uh-uh-uh. You missed one. Phesmatos incendia.
41144,Damon, You ok?
41145,Kai," Huh. I guess this is that, uh, antimagic border, which means now there's a psycho loose in Mystic Falls and no vampires around to stop him. Whoops."
41146,Stefan, Look. I'm sorry that Enzo k*ll her. He's...
41147,Matt," A monster. Yeah, I know, but you could have stopped him, and you didn't."
41148,Stefan," What, you think that was easy for me, watching an innocent girl die?"
41149,Matt, I don't know actually. You're not exactly the sharing type.
41150,Stefan," Matt, I promise you that everything I do I have thought out over and over, making sure it's the right thing to do."
41151,Matt, So we're just supposed to trust that you know best?
41152,Stefan, No. You're supposed to trust that I'm nothing like Enzo.
41153,Matt," The problem is you are, because no matter how close vampires get to humans, our lives will always mean less, so when push comes to shove, we'll be on opposite sides, which is what Tripp knew and I didn't."
41154,Elena, Jeremy?
41155,Jeremy, Let me guess. She's not with you?
41156,Elena," She was on her way, but... "
41157,Jeremy," But at the last minute, something went wrong, and it didn't work. I bet Damon's fine, isn't he?"
41158,Matt, Don't do that.
41159,Jeremy, Why not?
41160,Matt, Because I think channeling your rage might be a better option. How do you feel about being a hunter again?
41161,Jeremy, Why?
41162,Matt, Because I want you to help me k*ll Enzo.
41163,Alaric," So Jo drove me across the border. I told her she was crazy, that you'd never compel me."
41164,Damon," Look, Ric."
41165,Damon, We had to get Bonnie back.
41166,Alaric, Getting Bonnie back was never off the table. What was off the table was compelling me to steal from my girlfriend when we had promised her we'd keep her brother locked way.
41167,Damon," Yeah, I know."
41168,Alaric, Where is he - Kai?
41169,Damon," He's out, but it's not our fa..."
41170,Damon, I left Bonnie a note at the house. I told her we would be on your front porch.
41171,Damon, She'd probably be there now with about a half an hour to spare.
41172,Damon," She sacrificed everything for us over and over again, and then we were supposed to be there for her."
41173,Damon (V.O.), She's all alone.
41174,Kai, I think gin gets a bad rap.
41175,Kai," I'd rather not k*ll you, but I will."
41176,Tyler, What the hell do you want?
41177,Kai," This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm wanting to save Liv's life. Feel like making a deal with the devil?"
41178,Elena, What about Bonnie?
41179,Damon, She sacrificed herself so I could come back.
41180,Elena, She's all alone I'm sorry I compelled away the memories.
41181,Damon, We'll make new ones.
41182,Caroline," I hate you for ruining our friendship, and I think that I deserve better than that."
41183,Matt," Enzo, let her go, or I swear..."
41184,Matt, No!
41185,Matt, How do you feel about being a hunter again?
41186,Jeremy, Why?
41187,Matt, Because I want you to help me k*ll Enzo.
41188,Damon, Get the ascendant from Jo.
41189,Alaric, I understand.
41190,Jo, Damon is a vampire.
41191,Alaric, Are you saying Damon compelled me? He wouldn't do that. He's my friend.
41192,Alaric, Jo drove me across the border.
41193,Damon," Look, Ric."
41194,Luke, My coven put Kai in a prison world.
41195,Elena, Kai?
41196,Jo," As in our brother, my twin."
41197,Jo," In our coven's tradition, the twins merge their strength. The stronger one wins, absorbing their twin's power. The weaker one dies."
41198,Tyler, I'm not gonna let you die.
41199,Tyler, Kai is here.
41200,Kai," I guess this is that, uh, antimagic border, which means now there's a psycho loose in Mystic Falls and no vampires around to stop him."
41201,Tyler, What the hell do you want?
41202,Kai, Feel like making a deal with the devil?
41203,Jo, How much are you gonna want to k*ll me if I need to rain check tonight?
41204,Alaric, What happened?
41205,Jo," I have a possible 480 hit-and-run on campus, one DOA, 4 reds en route."
41206,Alaric, Have your previous boyfriends understood this language you speak?
41207,Jo, I'm gonna miss dinner. So you're my boyfriend now? ( b*at ) There's no hospital code for awkward silence.
41208,Jo, Give me two hours. Save me dinner.
41209,Woman," Doctor, we have a young female with abdominal wounds."
41210,Jo, Put her in T3. I need 10 milligrams of morphine. Mine's conscious.
41211,Other Doctor," See a lot of bl*od, no broken bones. Making any sense to you?"
41212,Jo," No, it's not. What happened to you? Were you hit by a car?"
41213,Female v*ctim, I can't breathe.
41214,Jo, It's ok. You can tell me what really happened. Sweetheart? Look at me.
41215,Jo, What happened to you?
41216,Kai, I stabbed her.
41217,Elena, Unh!
41218,Bonnie, Sorry. Had to.
41219,Elena," You know you just declared w*r, right?"
41220,Bonnie, Come on. Caroline's over there.
41221,Bonnie, Come on.
41222,Bonnie," Heh. Nope. I'm not noticing you. Today's not may 10, 1994. Today's the tree decorating ceremony, and you are not telling me otherwise."
41223,Caroline," I just figured that we were skipping Christmas this year, you know, considering the part where I die if I cross the border into my hometown."
41224,Liz, What happened to Christmas being your favorite time of the year?
41225,Caroline, Was my favorite time of year when I could actually live in my own house and help decorate the town tree and drink hot cocoa with my friends.
41226,Caroline, What are you doing? You're supposed to be at the Mystic Falls tree decorating ceremony.
41227,Liz, I'm playing hooky this year. I figure just because you can't come home for the holidays doesn't mean the holidays can't come to you.
41228,Caroline, You even brought our favorite ornaments. Mom!
41229,Stefan," Hey. I, uh, didn't know which ones to get, so I got both."
41230,Caroline, What are you doing here?
41231,Stefan, Your mom needed Christmas lights.
41232,Liz," You have a huge dorm, and I thought we could use an extra set of hands."
41233,Caroline," The little ones, obviously."
41234,Damon, Are you watching me sleep?
41235,Elena," No. I'm watching you drool all over Ric's textbooks, and considering you're already on his bad side..."
41236,Damon, I don't drool.
41237,Damon, Hmm. Ohh. What time is it?
41238,Elena, Time for Ric to get a new reference library. We've been looking all night. I swear I haven't found anything that even remotely resembles an Ascendant.
41239,Damon," Well, we haven't looked hard enough. Let's get to it."
41240,Damon, Find anything yet?
41241,Elena, Nope.
41242,Damon, Still staring.
41243,Elena, It's just... Everything you've been doing for Bonnie. Thank you.
41244,Damon, She'd do it for us.
41245,Elena," Hello, Ric."
41246,Alaric, Have you seen Jo?
41247,Elena," No, not since yesterday."
41248,Damon, Why?
41249,Elena," So I asked around the hospital. No one's seen Jo since last night at the ER. A bunch of stab v*ctim came in, and one of them's missing, as well."
41250,Alaric," It was Kai. Jo knew he'd come after her, and he did."
41251,Damon," Not to give you boyfriend lessons or anything, but if you knew Jo's whackjob brother was out on the loose and after her, don't you think that keeping an eye on her would have been a smart move?"
41252,Alaric," And what would you have had me do, Damon, ask you to compel Jo to stay put?"
41253,Elena," Guys, if Kai has Jo, we need a plan."
41254,Damon," Plan's easy. Find Kai, fftt, k*ll Kai. Mmhmm."
41255,Tyler," Bottom line, we need to keep Kai alive."
41256,Luke, You think I'm gonna protect the guy who chased us around the house with a baseball bat when we were 4?
41257,Liv," Luke's right, Tyler. You're on some serious crack."
41258,Tyler," Right now, you two are stuck doing the twinmerge for your coven, ok? That means one lives, one dies, but if we help Kai and he finds a way to merge with Jo, it's not your problem anymore."
41259,Luke, Until Kai becomes the most powerful witch in our coven and goes on a k*ll spree. Something tells me that's gonna become our problem.
41260,Liv, What does he want us to do exactly?
41261,Damon, Just think sociopathic Ryan Reynolds.
41262,Matt, Haven't seen him.
41263,Damon," Grunge vibe, annoying as hell."
41264,Matt, Still no idea.
41265,Damon," Well, if he has half a brain, he will be hiding where vampires can't find him. So in between levels of Mario Kart, can you and little baby Gilbert maybe keep an eye out?"
41266,Matt," Yeah, got it. If we see him, we'll let you know."
41267,Jeremy, Who was that?
41268,Matt," It was Damon. Apparently, there's a psychopath roaming Mystic Falls."
41269,Jeremy, You tell him we're busy hunting down a psychopath roaming outside Mystic Falls?
41270,Matt, Must have forgot to mention it. Look. You better get out of here. Enzo's gonna be here soon.
41271,Jeremy, Let's k*ll a vampire.
41272,Damon," Well, Bevis and Butthead are on the lookout. Anyone else brimming with confidence?"
41273,Alaric," I mean, this just doesn't make sense."
41274,Damon, What could possibly not make sense about magical twins absorbing into one another?
41275,Alaric," Listen. Jo needs her magic for the merge to work, ok, and she got rid of that back in 1994."
41276,Tyler, Kai said Jo hid her magic in a kn*fe somewhere.
41277,Liv," It's probably back in Portland, where she got rid of it in 1994."
41278,Tyler, He checked. The kn*fe's not there. He thinks someone took it.
41279,Damon, Jo doesn't have magic because it's stuffed in a kn*fe that was stolen and hidden by yours truly. Kai won't find it.
41280,Alaric," Yeah, unless Kai does a locator spell."
41281,Damon, It's impossible.
41282,Alaric, Why?
41283,Elena, Kai was born without the ability to do magic.
41284,Liv, Let me guess. Kai wants us to do a locator spell on the kn*fe.
41285,Tyler," If we find it, Jo can get her magic back, Kai can merge with her, and you and Luke"
41286,Luke, This is ridiculous. This is our job. Merging is our duty to the coven. It's why we were born.
41287,Liv, No. We were born because our coven decided that Jo wasn't strong enough to b*at Kai. Why should we have to die because our sister's too weak to defeat our psychopath of a brother?
41288,Luke," You know, a month ago, the thought of bowing out never even occurred to you."
41289,Liv," That's because Kai wasn't here a month ago, but he's here now. Luke, we don't have to do this. We have a chance to live out normal, human lives. We could actually be happy."
41290,Alaric," If the only way to restore Jo's magic is to reunite her with that kn*fe, Kai's gonna come for it."
41291,Elena," Ric's right. Even if Kai can't do the locator spell, he's gonna make it his mission to find it."
41292,Damon, Kai finds it. Great. Love it.
41293,Elena, Why aren't you more concerned?
41294,Damon," Because if Kai goes for the kn*fe, I will k*ll him because the kn*fe is right here where I hid it. Tada!"
41295,Kai," I know I tried to k*ll you when you were toddlers, but I got to say, it sure is nice to be around family for the holidays."
41296,Caroline, Dad's not here yet.
41297,Liz," Oh, yeah. You know what? He's not gonna make it. You remember his friend Steven? He needed help moving a couch or something, so he's gonna miss out."
41298,Caroline, But it's an undeclared law that the sheriff and her husband put the star on the tree!
41299,Liz, Then we will just have to let the Lockwoods have the honors this year.
41300,Caroline, Is something going on between you two?
41301,Liz," It'll be fine, I promise."
41302,Caroline," Mom, I'm a freshman in High School, ok? I can handle adult conversations."
41303,Liz," No worrying during the holidays, ok? And that tree is not gonna decorate itself. Go."
41304,Elena," Well, maybe you'll meet a cute surfer."
41305,Bonnie, Doubtful. My dad's conference is two hours away from any beach.
41306,Caroline, Ahh! Cute surfer? Where?
41307,Elena," Nowhere. Bonnie's dad is dragging her on a work trip, so I'm gonna ask my parents if she can spend the holiday with us."
41308,Bonnie, Are you serious?
41309,Elena," Yeah. The 3 of us have never spent Christmas apart. I plan on keeping it that way, even though Jeremy will hate it. It's always fun to torture him."
41310,Bonnie, Oh! I love you. Almost as much as I love torturing Jeremy.
41311,Caroline," Ok, great! Now that Christmas is saved, let's get these garlands on the tree before they end up on your hips."
41312,Stefan, Here. I got it.
41313,Caroline, What are you doing here?
41314,Stefan," Well, your mom asked for my help."
41315,Caroline," No, Stefan. What are you doing here? Because if you think hanging a few stands of light is gonna make me forget what a crappy friend you've been, then you thought wrong."
41316,Stefan," Caroline, I'm trying, ok?"
41317,Caroline," You're trying? No. This is the easy part, ok? We're hanging Christmas lights. Anyone can be friends when you're hanging Christmas lights."
41318,Liz, Who wants hot chocolate?
41319,Stefan, I was just leaving.
41320,Caroline, Mom?!
41321,Liz," Oh, wow. I just got really..."
41322,Caroline, Mom! You ok?
41323,Liv, What the hell is he doing?
41324,Luke, Probably playing tictactoe with himself like a crazy person.
41325,Kai, This is the antimagic border. Jo can get her magic back over there while over here...
41326,Jo, Hey. What did you do to me?
41327,Kai, Sissy's up.
41328,Jo, What the hell did you do to me?
41329,Kai, I haven't seen you in 18 years. You can't muster a hello?
41330,Jo, What did you guys do?
41331,Liv, What you should have done 18 years ago.
41332,Jo, It's not gonna work Kai. I don't have my...
41333,Kai, Magic. Yeah. Yeah. I recall. You stored it in this.
41334,Luke, What the hell?
41335,Kai, I'm trying to reunite Jo with her...
41336,Kai, Magic. It's not working.
41337,Luke," Enough, enough, man."
41338,Kai, I was wanting to k*ll you when your brain was the size of an acorn. You don't think I'll do it now?
41339,Luke, Whatever. I'm not watching this.
41340,Kai," Oh, so dramatic. All right. Sissy... Let's try this again."
41341,Jo," Stop. I put my magic in there by choice. Taking it back is also my choice unless I bleed to death, which will happen in the next 30 minutes. Heh. Wouldn't it be ironic if you accidentally k*ll me before the merge ceremony?"
41342,Kai, I'm going to find a bandage while you figure out how to put the magic in this kn*fe into our sister.
41343,Kai, Preferably by the time I get back so I don't have to dull it by slitting your throat.
41344,Elena, Hey!
41345,Caroline, Hey.
41346,Elena, What happened?
41347,Caroline," I don't know. She just collapsed. One second, we're decorating, and then the next, she's just on the ground. Maybe she forgot to eat. You know, sometimes, she skips breakfast."
41348,Elena," And when was the last time you ate, Caroline, as in fed?"
41349,Caroline," Oh, God. Now you sound like Stefan. He just went to go find something to take the edge off."
41350,Caroline, They have her sedated. She's going to be asleep for a while. Can you just come and distract me?
41351,Caroline, How's the search for the new Ascendant thingy?
41352,Elena, Not good. Damon and I spent the night researching.
41353,Caroline, God. Poor Bonnie. Do you think she knows it's Christmas? You know she never liked being away from us at Christmas.
41354,Elena," I don't know. It's probably better that she doesn't know, though."
41355,Caroline, So are you and Damon...
41356,Elena," I know what you're thinking, and no."
41357,Caroline," Actually, I was going to say that I think it's great how he's always been there for you when it mattered, you know, through thick and thin, good times and bad times. Maybe I haven't given him enough credit."
41358,Elena, You're clearly malnourished.
41359,Damon," Bet you think you're pretty clever, don't you?"
41360,Tyler, Is this Damon? Why don't I have your number saved?
41361,Damon," Well, you weren't in your dorm room, and your pouty little goth friend wasn't in hers."
41362,Tyler, It's creepy you know where Liv's dorm room is.
41363,Damon," Let me guess. You 3 idiots figured that Kai merging with Jo benefits you and Liv. Now I'm not sure exactly how Luke fits into that yet, but I'll use my imagination."
41364,Tyler, I'm trying to keep my girlfriend alive. Sound familiar?
41365,Damon, We both knew that wasn't gonna work. Where's Jo?
41366,Luke," I'm not telling you, and before you threaten to rip my head off, remember, all that does is guarantee Kai having to merge with Jo."
41367,Damon," Is that what you people think of me, that I just instantly resort to violence? I just have a question. I mean, look. I get why you don't want to merge with Liv, ok, because no one wants to see that face with her hair. I get it, but what makes you think Kai merging with Jo is any smarter? I mean, I heard he k*ll 4 of your siblings, and that was without magic. Eh, it'll be fine. I'm sure when Kai gets all that power he's just gonna mellow right on out. Heh."
41368,Luke, Stop.
41369,Enzo, And here I thought we were meeting for tea and crumpets.
41370,Matt, I'm giving you information about a girl who's supposed to be Stefan's long lost niece. I'm not exactly interested in him finding out.
41371,Enzo, And why are you helping me? I thought you unfriended me when I k*ll that little con artist.
41372,Matt, Monique. Her name was Monique.
41373,Enzo," Eh, two names actually... First Sarah, then Monique, probably others. I asked you why you're helping me."
41374,Matt," She knew something that Stefan didn't want her to know, and for some screwed up reason, you're obsessed with knowing Stefan's secrets. Probably because he has everything you'll never have."
41375,Enzo, Answer the bloody question. Why are you helping me?
41376,Matt, Because I want this obsession to take you the hell away from here. This is all the information Monique told me about her past. Take it and get out.
41377,Enzo, Think I didn't plan for that?
41378,Elena, Caroline could really use whatever's in that cup.
41379,Elena," Is it just me, or does that look really bad for somebody who just fainted?"
41380,Stefan," That doctor just came over from radiology. I overheard her say ""glioblastoma."""
41381,Elena," Glioblastoma? No, but that... no. No, no."
41382,Stefan," We brought her in a couple of weeks ago after Tripp's guys grabbed here. Doctors ran some tests, and apparently they found something suspicious."
41383,Elena," No, but that doesn't make sense, Stefan. Caroline would have said something."
41384,Stefan, Or maybe her mom hasn't told her yet.
41385,Elena, ( compelling ) What's going on with Liz Forbes?
41386,Doctor, Her recent MRI showed a lesion on her brainstem. We think it's metastasized to her spine.
41387,Elena, C-can you operate?
41388,Doctor," If the tumor's already spread, it would be impossible."
41389,Elena, But that would mean... Does she know?
41390,Doctor," For a few weeks now, but news like this takes time to digest."
41391,Jeremy, Ugh. Wouldn't it be a billion times easier just to stake him in the heart?
41392,Matt," Yeah, but he wouldn't suffer. Get the door."
41393,Jeremy, Wait. This isn't about making him suffer. It's about making sure he doesn't k*ll anyone else.
41394,Matt," He just k*ll an innocent girl, Jer. He deserves to suffer."
41395,Jeremy," Dude, you sound like Tripp."
41396,Matt, You mean the guy whose neck Enzo slit open for trying to protect innocent people?
41397,Jeremy, I'm just saying you're being a little intense.
41398,Matt," Maybe that's the problem, Jer. We've all been looking the other way because we're friends with vampires, but how many people need to die for us to face the fact that vampires also k*ll people?"
41399,Jeremy," So what, you'd do the same thing to Stefan? What about Elena or Caroline?"
41400,Matt, Just help me get him to the van.
41401,Jeremy," Look. I know how you feel. I was supernaturally programmed to take out my sister, remember, but this whole us versus them thing is gonna drive you crazy, and it's gonna get you k*ll."
41402,Jo, Hey. It will be ok. Just needed to get rid of Kai so you could free me.
41403,Liv," Look, Jo. You can't run away from this anymore. You've had 18 years of freedom. Now take your magic back and do this. You owe it to the coven."
41404,Jo," Is that what you think, that I've been shirking my responsibility to our family?"
41405,Liv," Luke's all I've got. If we merge and he dies... I may as well be dead, too."
41406,Jo," If Kai merges with me, he'll be more powerful than any of us."
41407,Liv," Did it ever occur to you that maybe you're strong enough to b*at him? You were 22 the last time you went up against him. Since then, you've been a combat medic, you've saved hundreds of lives, and your hospital worships you."
41408,Jo, Someone's done her research.
41409,Liv," You're my sister, and I'm yours. Look how far you've come without magic. You didn't get here listening to people tell you you weren't strong enough."
41410,Jo, Liv!
41411,Kai, Can't say I didn't warn her.
41412,Kai, Phesmatos superous em animi...
41413,Jo," Kai, stop!"
41414,Kai," Isn't it gonna be funny when I k*ll her using her own magic? Wait. Is that funny or sad? I get my emotions mixed up. Hey. What's the one for fire again? It's ""incendia,"" right? Phesmatos..."
41415,Jo," Kai, enough!"
41416,Jo, Lectos espiritox.
41417,Damon," That's it? We're gonna k*ll bad guys together, and you're not gonna talk to me?"
41418,Alaric," Look. You blew up your car, you needed a ride. Doesn't mean we have to talk."
41419,Damon, All right. Look. I agree that maybe compelling you to betray your lady friend was an irrational decision stemming from untreated control issues.
41420,Damon, What?
41421,Damon," I'm sorry, Ric."
41422,Alaric, Is that it?
41423,Damon, Yeah.
41424,Alaric, Great. Let's finish this.
41425,Kai," There it is. Oh, so predictable. I threaten Liv, you do anything it takes to save Liv."
41426,Jo, Fractos.
41427,Damon," Cemetery, really?"
41428,Kai, Motus.
41429,Kai," Oh, whoops. Looks like you found the anti-magic border. Drew a line in the dirt for everyone's convenience. See? Yeah. You're welcome."
41430,Damon, Thank you. k*ll him.
41431,Jo," Alaric, don't!"
41432,Alaric, What are you talking about?
41433,Damon," She's lightheaded and confused. I'll give her some of my bl*od, ok? k*ll him."
41434,Jo," No, you can't. If Kai dies, Liv and Luke have to do the merge. It's not fair to them."
41435,Damon, Who cares? k*ll him.
41436,Jo," Ric, don't. I can win. I can b*at Kai. I just need a little time to get stronger."
41437,Damon, We're moved truly. ( to Ric ) k*ll him now.
41438,Jo, I'll figure out a way to win. Please you have to trust me. Keep him alive.
41439,Damon, Ric.
41440,Tyler, Why the hell did you tell Damon where they were?
41441,Luke, Because I realized listening to you two was a huge mistake. Kai's a monster.
41442,Tyler, So you'll just risk your sister's life? How the hell does that make sense? Hey! I'm talking to you.
41443,Liv," Everyone, chill! Jo thinks she can b*at Kai."
41444,Luke," You and I both know that's crap. Kai's a million times stronger. She'll die, and the first thing Kai's gonna do is k*ll everyone in our coven as punishment for putting him away, and then he'll turn on innocent people because he's crazy and bored and homicidal."
41445,Liv," Fine. Then I'm selfish, Luke, but I'd rather be alive and selfish than this dead martyr who served her purpose to her coven."
41446,Luke," People are gonna die, and it's gonna be our fault. Remember that."
41447,Elena, Are you ok?
41448,Stefan," There's a 22-year-old sociopathic witch running around Mystic Falls right now. That we have a plan for. We've dealt with every kind of evil there is, and we always have a plan, but this... If Caroline loses her mom, it'll destroy her."
41449,Elena, I know.
41450,Stefan," She doesn't deserve this, Elena. She's a good person. She's happy, she's kind."
41451,Elena," I know. I should tell her. It's only a matter of time before she compels a doctor, and I don't want her finding out from a stranger, you know?"
41452,Stefan, Let me do it.
41453,Elena," No, Stefan. You don't have to."
41454,Stefan," Let Damon know. I should tell Caroline. I haven't been there for her. Caroline needed me, and I ran away. So... yeah, I have to do it."
41455,Alaric," I guess we'll just lock up your brother until you two, you know..."
41456,Jo, Merge our twin powers during the next celestial event?
41457,Alaric," Yeah. There really is no sugarcoating that, is there?"
41458,Jo," For the record, I've dated doctors and lawyers and a couple of artist types, but none of my previous boyfriends would have ever understood that."
41459,Alaric," Here. Let me, uh..."
41460,Jo, Be careful.
41461,Kai," So this whole antimagic thing, is it like a... Like a dome or a bubble? Like, say, you were in 747 flying over Mystic Falls, would you die? You know, that could be dangerous, like if you're headed to New York and your pilot reroutes for weather."
41462,Damon," How's this? I k*ll you, and when you're in hell, you can ask a bar full of dead travelers, who cast the damn spell."
41463,Damon, That's a lot of travelers. Must be a pretty big spell. ( quietly ) Like a really big spell. So big... It covers every inch of an entire town.
41464,Alaric, What the hell are you doing?
41465,Damon, I'm working on my knuckleball.
41466,Alaric," We are keeping him alive, Damon."
41467,Damon, Can I ask why we continuously compromise logic for some girl you just met?
41468,Alaric," You know, I don't know how I went so long without saying this, but you're a real dick."
41469,Damon," Bonnie's stuck over there because of him. She's over there, and I'm over here, and I hate myself for it."
41470,Alaric," Yeah, and k*ll him will make you feel better, so let's just stop pretending for a second that this is about anyone else but you."
41471,Damon, You should probably go change that tire.
41472,Bonnie," Ok, tree. Let's do this."
41473,Liz," Now that's what I call a Christmas tree. Isn't that gorgeous? The holidays are all about being with loves ones, and I think that's what makes this tradition so special in our town. It's a reminder that no matter where you turn you have a friend."
41474,Caroline, Biggest mistake of junior year... Including the boys in secret santa. Stefan is officially the worst gift giver.
41475,Elena, He got you a snow globe?
41476,Caroline," Yeah, of Mystic Falls, as if I don't see enough of this town every day as it is."
41477,Bonnie," Well, I love my bracelet."
41478,Caroline," Of course you do because I am good at secret santa, and I didn't purchase it from a quick stop."
41479,Elena," Looks like someone is missing the true meaning of Christmas. Come on. We're happy and healthy, and we're together."
41480,Stefan, Hey.
41481,Caroline," Hey. Uh, there's no news. Apparently, they're still running tests."
41482,Stefan, Caroline... We need to talk.
41483,Damon, Hey. Where are you? I can't hear you.
41484,Elena," I'm at the medical center. Where are you? Reception's horrible. Damon, can you hear me?"
41485,Damon, Hey. Elena!
41486,Enzo, Fancy something else? I always figured I'd bow out to the Everly brothers or...
41487,Damon, He stopped talking. He never stops talking.
41488,Kai, Magia tollox de terras. Utera aso utox.
41489,Damon, What happened to his chains?
41490,Alaric, Is he chanting?
41491,Kai, Utera aso utox...
41492,Kai, Magia tollox de terras. Utera aso utox.
41493,Enzo, It's a Christmas miracle.
41494,Damon, You little magic sucker. Sucked up all that magic from the traveler spell.
41495,Kai, A lot of magic.
41496,Damon," Gah! I really, really hate that move."
41497,Damon," Ric! Hey. Come on. Take my damn hand, Ric. Come on."
41498,Alaric, How are you not dead?
41499,Enzo," If we've learned anything from today, it's that we should k*ll our enemies with haste."
41500,Matt, Then what are you waiting for? Go ahead and k*ll me.
41501,Enzo, I said enemies. Don't flatter yourself.
41502,Matt," What do you want, Enzo?"
41503,Enzo," You were right. I am jealous of Stefan. He has what I want... Respect, family, girls he doesn't deserve. He throws it all away, and yet still somehow manages to come out winning. You are going to help me deplete every ounce of happiness from his life, and when there's nothing left, I'll decide if you get to live. Oh, and, uh, happy holidays."
41504,Elena, You mean home home?
41505,Damon," Ahh. Just walked through the front door, which I should probably start locking now that Kai's supercharged and on the prowl."
41506,Elena, Let's just celebrate the fact that we can go home. I could really use some happy news right now. Today sucked.
41507,Damon, I'm listening.
41508,Elena," So look. I don't know what we were or are or what we're supposed to be, but all I know is that today was pretty horrible, and I just... I want to see you. I have something I need to tell you."
41509,Damon," Come over. I'll cook you dinner, and we'll talk about our crappy days."
41510,Caroline, That just doesn't make sense. My mom would have said something to me.
41511,Stefan," We were worried, so... Elena compelled one of the doctors for information."
41512,Caroline, Ok. So my mom has a brain tumor. Then we'll just give her vampire bl*od.
41513,Stefan," Caroline, do you think that if our bl*od cured cancer we would have heard about that by now?"
41514,Caroline, Fine. Then when are they gonna operate?
41515,Stefan, That's the problem. They can't.
41516,Caroline," Ok. Well, if they can't operate, then they'll give her chemo, right?"
41517,Stefan, The tumor is growing so fast the doctors don't think that will work.
41518,Caroline," Well, then they're wrong because they don't know her. They don't know how strong she is. I mean, she's gonna get through this, Stefan. Right?"
41519,Jeremy," We miss you, Bonnie."
41520,Bonnie, I miss you guys.
41521,Damon, That's not possible.
41522,Damon, What? This was gone. I blew this up.
41523,Stefan," Yeah? Well, you weren't around to annoy me for the last 4 months, so I had a bit of extra time on my hands."
41524,Damon, Ha!
41525,Stefan, Think of it as a early merry Christmas/late welcome back to life present.
41526,Damon, Ha ha ha! Thank you.
41527,Stefan," Hey. Just, uh, do me a favor. Don't die again. Those fenders were a real bitch to find."
41528,Damon, Deal. Deal. Ha! Yeah.
41529,Damon," Well, we're home."
41530,Stefan, Yep.
41531,Damon, You sticking around?
41532,Stefan," Well, that depends. Might have to k*ll Jeremy if I find out that he slept in my bed."
41533,Elena, Mistletoe. Clever.
41534,Damon, Hello. Anybody there?
41535,Elena," Damon, what are you doing?"
41536,Elena, Are you gonna let me in or...
41537,Elena, Um... heh.
41538,Kai, I may have put a cloaking spell on us.
41539,Kai, How genius is that?
41540,Sarah, I'm Zach and Gail's daughter. Sarah Salvatore. Why don't you believe me?
41541,Stefan," Because Sarah Salvatore is at Duke university, where she studies as an art major. Now, who the hell are you?"
41542,Sarah, My name is Monique.
41543,Enzo, I want the whole story.
41544,Stefan, Don't do this.
41545,Matt, No!
41546,Enzo, I'll find out sooner or later.
41547,Caroline," So, my mom has a brain tumor. Then I'll just give her vampire bl*od."
41548,Stefan," If our bl*od cured cancer, we would've heard about that by now."
41549,Jo," In our coven's tradition, the twins merge their strength. The stronger one wins and-- The weaker one dies."
41550,Liv, Why should we have to die because our sister's too weak to defeat our psychopath of a brother?
41551,Luke, Merging is our duty to the coven. It's why we were born.
41552,Kai, This is the anti-magic border.
41553,Damon, You sucked up all that magic from the Traveler's spell.
41554,Kai, A lot of magic.
41555,Elena," I don't know what we were or are or what we're supposed to be, but I want to see you."
41556,Damon, Come over.
41557,Damon, Anybody there?
41558,Kai, I may have put a cloaking spell on us.
41559,Kai," See, we never went out to dinner when I was a kid, so, I always had this fascination with chefs and fine dining. Dad actually lets me cook... Taught me to measure by eye. Seasonings to taste, all that stuff, but it's different now in the restaurant world."
41560,Kai," ...Everything's on time. It's like, the fries go in, it dings and you take 'em out. Literally no guess work."
41561,Elena, Why am I here?
41562,Kai," Uh, well I spent eighteen years in abandoned restaurants and now I'm showing off the fruits of my labor."
41563,Elena, I don't mean the Mystic Grill
41564,Kai," Oh, you mean like, here here, in Mystic Falls. (laughs) Sorry, I'm nervous. You're like, really pretty."
41565,Elena," Why am I here, Kai?"
41566,Kai," Well, I took the spell that was keeping supernaturals out of Mystic Falls and I, I like absorbed it...Like ate it, I guess. (Takes another bite) It's cool, huh? First I eat magic, and then eventually, I lose it. But a huge spell like that? I mean, come on. Magic's oozing out of me, it's all over the place. You know, I didn't quite realize I was out of control until I met the manager of the Grill a few hours ago. And he was all like, (mocking voice) ""Hey, you can't come in here; we're closed. And you have an unconscious girl over your shoulder."" (Elena laughs sarcastically, unamused) And then I was like, ""Don't judge me."" And then I gave him a heart-attack--tried to, but all I did was make him vomit uncontrollably, which was like, ugh, let's stop that. (Elena stares at him, disgusted) So then I tried again and I think I broke his spine? I mean, I'm not, I'm not really sure, because the third time I tried the spell, he kinda exploded in bl*od. Whoops. (Takes a drink of coffee)"
41567,Elena, What the hell is wrong with you?
41568,Kai," I just told you, I have too much magic. (Elena shakes her head) You know, it wasn't until after my test run with the manager that I realized, if I start to merge with Jo and my gushing fountains of magic turn her into that guy, then I'm not gonna have a twin for the merge. So, Elena, that is why you are here. (takes another bite) Because I need to get my magic under control. (Elena glares at Kai) By practicing with you. Or rather, by practicing on you. (Elena looks horrified) Oh, PS: Silver lining, after the manager finally stopped thrashing around, I finally managed a cloaking spell. Thank you. (takes a drink of orange juice; Elena is still glaring) It's easy to do and...undo. Phasmatos oculix. (Dead manager appears on table in front of Elena)"
41569,Elena," (gasps and scoots back in her chair, horrified)"
41570,Kai, Table for three (laughs) You had no idea. 
41571,Stefan," (gets up, goes downstairs and into the kitchen; Jeremy is standing there, shirtless, a towel around his waist) Oh. Because that's the first thing I wanna see in the morning."
41572,Jeremy," Sorry, I forgot you lived here. (leaves kitchen)"
41573,Stefan," Yeah. Hey, any chance you could help me out with some speakers at Caroline's--(Jeremy's gone) house? (Stefan checks the coffee pot, it's almost empty) Thanks for the coffee. "
41574,Liv, Ow!
41575,Jo, Sorry! Are you okay?
41576,Liv," (Comes out into the hallway, her clothes smoking) Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just clothes and skin. (See Stefan) Hey, where can I get a tee shirt?"
41577,Stefan," Damon's room. Upstairs, end of the hall. (walks into living room to find Jo and a mess) What are you doing in my house?"
41578,Jo," Fire spell. Sort of. It turns out, getting back in touch with your magic isn't anything like riding a bike. (laughs)"
41579,Stefan, Oh.
41580,Jo," I am sorry about that vase, though. Was that expensive?"
41581,Stefan," Well, I don't know. But the Smithsonian would. You should call them."
41582,Jo," (stands and goes over to Alaric) Oh, thank God. Breakfast. Please tell me that you brought mimosas."
41583,Alaric, Do you actually think I'd watch this sober?
41584,Stefan," And, what exactly are we watching?"
41585,Jo," Today, we make smores. In a month, I win the merge and become leader of my coven, guaranteeing it's survival. Liv has me on a 30-day regimen between now and the next celestial event."
41586,Stefan, And this regimen has to happen in my living room...why?
41587,Alaric, Damon feels guilty.
41588,Stefan, What's new? And where the hell is he?
41589,Liz, I paid extra for this room to be a single.
41590,Damon," (stretching) Well, you clearly underestimate the number of women who'd die to spend a night with me. "
41591,Liz," Well, I'm not dead yet. (laughs) Any word from Elena?"
41592,Damon," (lounging back in his chair) Oh, I got words. Plural. I got, ""Something came up at the dorm, had to bail, can we raincheck?"" and an emoticon of a cold shower."
41593,Liz, Ouch. Have you at least managed to patch things up with Ric?
41594,Damon," Well, baby steps. Step one: allow him to turn my house into Hogwarts. Step two: call in a favor from the Sheriff. Ask her to put out an APB on a super-charged serial k*ll named Kai Parker."
41595,Liz," (checking her phone) Yeah, I already had my guys on the lookout. No one matching Kai's description popped up overnight."
41596,Damon, What the hell is he doing?
41597,Caroline, (enters the room) Bad news is: the employee kitchen didn't have a juicer. Good news is: they do now.
41598,Liz, What is this?
41599,Caroline," It's a kale smoothie. It's good for DNA cell repair (Liz looks to Damon, who shrugs) and for slowing cancer. Oh, are you warm enough?"
41600,Liz, I'm fine.
41601,Caroline, Let me just get you another blanket. (gets blanket out of drawer)
41602,Damon, So you can literally smother her?
41603,Caroline," (covering Liz up) I'm just trying to help here, since apparently, modern medicine takes forever. I don't understand why we can't skip all the guess-work and go straight to something that works. Like vampire bl*od."
41604,Liz," We are not having this conversation again, sweetheart."
41605,Caroline," Okay, then what do you want to talk about? How the doctors can't operate, how chemo won't work, how radiation won't shrink the tumor? Damon, feel free to jump in with your support here at any time."
41606,Damon," Well, I think that would require you having my support, Caroline."
41607,Caroline, You don't think that our bl*od will work?
41608,Damon," For 170-odd years, I've never known an instance where our bl*od cured cancer. But hey, sheriff, if you want to be a guinea pig in an experimental study involving weird, unpredictable magic...Far be it from me to stop you."
41609,Liz," Look, sweetheart. For now, I would like to put my faith in science. Which means going home on doctor's orders, having a nice, quiet day and waiting for more MRI results. "
41610,Damon," (getting up from his chair) See? Ahh, mommy knows best. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to make sure those witches aren't destroying my house. Bye, bye. (winks at Liz)"
41611,Liv," (rummaging through Damon's drawers; talking to Tyler on the phone) Damon may be a vile creature, but he has the best clothes."
41612,Tyler, (walking through Whitmore) Should I be wondering why you're in Damon Salvatore's bedroom?
41613,Liv, Jo scorched my shirt.
41614,Tyler, So you're shirtless in Damon's bedroom.
41615,Liv, (laughing) You must be feeling such mixed emotions right now.
41616,Tyler, How's the training going?
41617,Liv," Jo's terrible. If she went up against Kai today, she'd lose in like, nine seconds. Luke totally called that one."
41618,Tyler," Yeah, but you've got time to whip her into shape. Has Luke been giving you crap?"
41619,Liv, He's been texting and I've been ignoring.
41620,Tyler, If he finds out you're training Jo--
41621,Liv," He won't. Chill, okay? (hangs up and closes drawer, taking one of Damon's shirts)"
41622,Caroline, You kept my orchid alive. That's amazing.
41623,Liz, I wanted everything to be just the same when you finally came home.
41624,Stefan, Hey.
41625,Liz, What is this?
41626,Caroline," Uhm, Stefan volunteered to move your entertainment center in here, so now you can watch TV from your favorite chair."
41627,Stefan," Yeah, I hooked up the surround sound to your DVD player and I left a universal remote on the table, right there."
41628,Liz," Well, thanks. Guess it never occured to anybody to just...move my chair, but... (Stefan is watching Liz worriedly; Liz smirks) What's the matter? Never seen anyone with Stage 4 cancer before?"
41629,Stefan," Actually, no, I haven't. One of the few perks of starting over ever few decades, real life never really catches up to you."
41630,Caroline," So if you start the Friends boxset now, I'll be back in time for Monica and Chandler's wedding. Stefan, you know how to laugh, right?"
41631,Stefan," Opinions vary. Wait, why? Are you leaving?"
41632,Caroline," Every minute counts, so I'm going to go get a second opinion from one of the world's leading experts in Grade 4 Glioblastoma. (Liz gives Caroline a look) I couldn't sleep; I Googled."
41633,Liz, And where is the internet sending you?
41634,Caroline, Duke.
41635,Stefan," Duke? You know what, maybe I'll give you a ride. I was thinking of heading that way to check on a friend."
41636,Caroline, A friend?
41637,Stefan, Mmmhm.
41638,Caroline," Stefan, I know all of your friends. Elena. Me. (pretends to think) And then that's it."
41639,Liz," I think it would be better if you had some company on the road. (turns to Stefan) Thank you, Stefan. (Stefan nods and heads for the door)"
41640,Caroline, (hugs Liz) I will call you every hour on the hour.
41641,Liz, I will set my watch by it.
41642,Caroline, I love you.
41643,Liz," I love you, too. Bye. (Caroline and Stefan leave; Liz sighs and sits in her chair tiredly)"
41644,Elena, We're in my high school?
41645,Kai," They have plenty of restrooms, no flammable surfaces, and everyone's on winter break...Still. You know, it's no wonder America got dumb while I was locked up; they're never in school. (Looking at pictures in the trophy case of the cheerleading squad; grinning) Is that you? Oh, and there's Bonnie. You guys look so innocent. Smiling, like nothing bad could ever happen to you. "
41646,Kai," (Straightens and looks back at Elena) Anyway, do you mind if I try to turn your bl*od into acid again?"
41647,Elena, (surprised) Again?
41648,Kai," (taking off his jacket) Yeah, that's uh, that's kinda how you got here in the first place. (throws his jacket on the floor) I was trying the whole acid-blood thing and I think I burst a few important capillaries in your brain, because you blacked out."
41649,Elena," Kai, you don't have to do this. Listen to me, you don't have to do this."
41650,Kai, Phasmatos navaro pulsus sanguinox
41651,Elena, Ow!
41652,Kai, Phasmatos navaro
41653,Elena, Stop! 
41654,Kai, Sanguinox
41655,Elena," (looks at her ring in horror as it melts) My ring. Kai, you're melting my ring."
41656,Kai, Phasmatos
41657,Elena," Kai, stop it!"
41658,Kai, Navaro pul--
41659,Elena," No, no, no, no. No, no, no. (reaches sink and rinses off her hand; her ring is gone) No. No."
41660,Kai," Take it that ring meant something to you? (Elena looks around for something to use against Kai) I never understood sentimental attachments to things, because then it's so upsetting when you lose them."
41661,Jo, That doesn't count. I was distracted.
41662,Damon, (to Liv) Are you wearing my shirt? (Liv smiles at him; Damon's phone rings) Magic camp. How may I help you?
41663,Elena," (back at the high school on a school emergency phone; frantic) Damon, Kai has me at the high school. I need your help."
41664,Damon, Whoa. Elena?
41665,Kai," (trying to break Elena's neck, but keeps moving other things around instead; Elena is crawling backwards away from him) Really? (Kai walks toward Elena and tries again, but knocks over something else) Dammit. (Elena gets up to run, but Kai finally succeeds in breaking her neck. Kai does a victory fist and walks to stand over Elena) Bingo."
41666,Caroline," (she has her cell to her ear, on hold) So your friend I've never heard of is a world-famous photographer?"
41667,Stefan," Well, it's a student exhibition."
41668,Caroline," Oh, goody. Freshman art. Since you're so good at noticing untapped potential. How do you know this person again? (someone talks to Caroline on the other end of the line) Oh! Yes, I did call earlier about a consult with Dr. Moore? Great. (to Stefan) Okay, they can see us right now."
41669,Stefan, You know what? I'm gonna catch up.
41670,Caroline," Okay. Uh, Oncology Center, D4. Come find me. "
41671,Stefan, Okay. (Caroline turns and leaves the room; Stefan approaches one of the instructors) Excuse me. Can you point me to Sarah Nelson's exhibit?
41672,Instructor, (smiles) Far corner. Good choice: She's one of our best new students.
41673,Stefan, Thank you.
41674,Sarah," According to the saying, when a child dies, an angel will take the child in her arms and fly her over all the places she loved best, so she can see them one last time before she goes to Heaven. That's what I had in mind with this aerial point of view. And then I wanted to catch the sunlight flaring off the windows because it obscures the reflection of the viewer who's looking down at them."
41675,Enzo, Good stuff. 
41676,Stefan, What are you doing here?
41677,Enzo, Same thing you are. Looking for a little...art to decorate my wall. (Enzo sips his wine)
41678,Caroline," (walking beside Dr. Moore) And that's when I read your article in the ""New England Journal of Medicine."" You know, the one about tumor reduction using hypothermia treatments?"
41679,Dr. Moore, That's not exactly light reading.
41680,Caroline," Well, I didn't say I understood it. (laughs nervously) These are my mom's charts. Look, your bio said that you are an amazing expert on glioblastoma and I really, really need an expert because my mom's doctors are telling her that she's not a cadidate for clinical trials. (looks into the doctor's eyes, compelling her) And you're not gonna give me any grief on insurance or confidentiality or anything except your honest opinion."
41681,Dr. Moore," (looking over Liz's charts) Her doctors are doing everything right. It's a Grade IV tumor. They could try full-brain radiation, but that would seriously impact any remaining quality of life. She'll face cognitive and verbal decline, motor loss, personality change, and meanwhile, she could still develop morphine-resistant pain. "
41682,Caroline," So, you're saying that there's no feasible medical solution?"
41683,Dr. Moore," I really wish there were. I have a patient in nearly identical condition. He hasn't responded to any treatment. Now, he's just running down the clock. "
41684,Caroline, I want to see him.
41685,Kai," (grinning) Oh, hello."
41686,Elena, Nice shirt.
41687,Kai," Well, thanks. Yeah, somebody b*rned my other one. Which was awesome, by the way."
41688,Kai," I am starting to see why Damon digs you. You are crazy-pants. Oh, it sucks about that shirt, though."
41689,Elena," So you can care about an inanimate object, but not the people that you k*ll?"
41690,Kai," Oh. (takes a drink of soda) Is going to be like an episode of ""Ricki Lake"" where I come face-to-face with my demons and change for the better?"
41691,Elena, Have you really not cared about anyone?
41692,Kai," (looking nostalgic) I guess I liked my brother, Joey. We played Dr. Mario together and he'd always win. Actually, one of my favorite memories is when I finally b*at him (Kai and Elena both are smiling slightly). Of course, my favorite memory is when I finally b*at him to death."
41693,Kai," You don't have to waste your energy trying to change me. If Ricki taught me anything, it's that liking yourself is the most important thing. And I like me."
41694,Liv," To think, a day almost went by where I wasn't roped into saving one of your friends."
41695,Damon, (getting out of the car) Cry me a river. Just do this stupid cloaking spell so I can go grab Elena and you can get back to wrecking my mansion.
41696,Liv, (sighs) Fine.
41697,Damon, What are you doing? The back door's right here.
41698,Liv, I'm not going in there.
41699,Damon, What?
41700,Liv," If Kai even gets a glimpse of me, I'm dead. I'm strong enough to do the spell from out here."
41701,Damon," Whatever. Hope you cloak better than you teach. (Liv rolls her eyes) 'Cause from the looks of my living room, Jo's not learning very much."
41702,Liv," Relax. With a bit of practice, she'll be merge-ready in no time. (Liv looks like she doesn't believes that, but turns back to do the spell) Phasmatos radium cara. Phasmatos--"
41703,Damon, (turns and Liv is gone) Liv? Liv? Hey! Liv!
41704,Luke, (appears out of nowhere) Sorry.
41705,Damon, What the hell are you doing here?
41706,Luke, She doesn't have time for this. Invisique.
41707,Damon, (Luke disappears) No!
41708,Damon," So, Liv's gone. I need a Plan B."
41709,Alaric," (back at the boarding house) What do you mean, she's gone?"
41710,Damon, Her wonder twin took her and I can't just go blazing in there; Kai will k*ll Elena to spite me. I need a witch.
41711,Jo, (back at the boarding house with Alaric) I can do it.
41712,Alaric, You can barely light a candle.
41713,Jo, Cloaking is one of the first things they teach you as a Gemini. I learned it when I was a kid.
41714,Alaric, But?
41715,Jo," I'll have to stay beside Damon while I do it, which means I'll have to go inside."
41716,Alaric," Okay, look. There's gotta be some other option."
41717,Jeremy, (comes into the room holding a crossbow) There is. Right here.
41718,Damon," (through the speaker-phone) Let me guess, Jeremy's holding a crossbow."
41719,Jo, No one is k*ll Kai.
41720,Jeremy," Well, we're not letting Kai k*ll Elena."
41721,Alaric, Nobody's letting anyone die.
41722,Damon, Anyone have any other ideas?
41723,Luke," Dad's pissed, okay? He wants us back in Portland now."
41724,Liv, I was helping them.
41725,Luke, (packing) They can help themselves. We're not their dancing witch-monkeys. (holds up books) Do you wanna bring these books back?
41726,Liv," Take the books, leave the books. Who cares? Did you tell dad I was helping Jo get stronger? Is that why he's pissed? (Luke sighs, but doesn't reply) Of course you did. You're just like him."
41727,Luke," Actually, I can think for myself. I've always said that Kai was too dangerous to become leader of the coven. You've been wasting your time with Jo. We both know she's never gonna b*at him."
41728,Liv," You don't get it, do you?"
41729,Luke, Get what?
41730,Liv, You just cloaked me and I couldn't fight it. You're stronger than me.
41731,Luke," No, you don't know that."
41732,Liv," Yes, I do. I've known it for months. Since that night when I was trying to bring people back from the other side and you interrupted my spell."
41733,Luke, You were about to collapse. You were already weak.
41734,Liv," We're supposed to be equal. We're not. I know you, Luke. I know you love me. And  I know a huge part of you hopes that it's me that makes it through this. But it's not a coin toss anymore. If we merge, you win and I die. That scares the crap out of me. So. If you wanna pack the books, pack the damn books. I'm not gonna be the one reading them."
41735,Matt," (about the manager, lying dead on the table where Kai left him) I came in to do inventory and found him like this. Sorry to bother you on your day off, Sheriff, but--"
41736,Liz," No, I'm glad you called. (sarcastically) I don't think he died of natural causes."
41737,Matt, (laughs humorlessly and checks the time on his cell) 22 hours and 18 minutes. That's how long supernatural beings have been allowed back in Mystic Falls and I already know someone who's dead because of it.
41738,Liz," I'm sorry, Matt. We'll figure out who did this and we'll deal with it."
41739,Matt," This is never gonna end, is it? The attacks, the cover-ups? This is our life again."
41740,Liz," This is Mystic Falls. It'll always be Mystic Falls. You love it here, y-- "
41741,Matt," Woah, woah, hey. Sheriff, you okay?"
41742,Liz, (stands with Matt's help and nods) Yeah.
41743,Caroline," Colin Phelps. Inoperable tumor. They zapped your brain with radiation for months. They still couldn't save you. (Caroline sits on the edge of the bed; Colin moans) Yeah, I'd be groggy too, if I were on this many k*ll. And the doctor said all they can do is make you comfortable while you wait for the end. I'm really sorry to hear that."
41744,Caroline," Next of kin, none. I'm really sorry to hear that, too. But you see, on my mom's chart, this spot, next of kin, that's where my name goes. Caroline Forbes. I'm all she's got."
41745,Caroline," (using compulsion) Hey, I know we just met, but you're not going to remember any of this."
41746,Elena," If the spell that you're going for is to creep me out, it's working."
41747,Elena, Ow. What are you doing?
41748,Kai," Oh, nothing. (he leans forward, licks his thumb and uses it to wipe away the remaining bl*od on Elena's face) Just working on my self-control."
41749,Damon, I can hear Kai yammering.
41750,Jo, What's he saying?
41751,Damon, He said it's a shame you don't have vamp-hearing.
41752,Jo," I get why you don't like me, you know? You were bros. A girl comes into the picture...It's awkward."
41753,Damon," It's not awkward, it's annoying."
41754,Jo, Because he's looking out for me?
41755,Damon, Yes. At the expense of logic and reason.
41756,Jo," Oh, let me guess: you've never done that for a girl before?"
41757,Damon, Shh.
41758,Kai, (walks past Jo and Damon and recycles his can) Okay. (he turns and walks away)
41759,Jo, What do you know? It's working.
41760,Stefan," So, I'm guessing you came here to make a demand?"
41761,Enzo," (shrugs) I only came to see what you were up to today. I hate unanswered questions and you've left me with a few. Such as, what secret did you need to protect by letting me k*ll that pitiful con artist pretending to be your long-lost relative, Sarah Salvatore? So, I followed you, in your inconspicuous red Porsche off the exit to Chapel Hill, and here we are. Sarah Nelson's photography exhibition."
41762,Stefan, Why do you care?
41763,Enzo," Well, it seems that Damon is unaware that the branches of his family tree might extend beyong just you. Call me old-fashioned, but I disapprove of secrets between brothers. So, I'll just go tell Sarah what your name is and--"
41764,Stefan, Don't do that.
41765,Enzo, Why don't you want to meet Sarah Nelson? You came all this way to see her work. 
41766,Stefan," What do you want me to tell you, Enzo? That the girl's my relative? Fine. She is Zach Salvatore's daughter, which makes her my great-niece 4 generations removed. I took her mother's body to the ER after Damon k*ll her. They did a C-section to save Sarah's life, but I kept that little detail from Damon so that she could live a good life in a nice home, where she felt safe and loved. That's my big secret."
41767,Enzo, Why are you so intent on keeping it?
41768,Stefan," You wanna tell Damon that I've been lying to him for the past eighteen years? Go ahead, be my guest. Maybe he'll hate me or maybe he'll realize it was the best thing I could have done for everyone. But either way, once you tell him, you'll have nothing left to obsess about."
41769,Stefan, Hi.
41770,Caroline, I thought you were meeting me here.
41771,Stefan," Yeah, I got into a bidding w*r over a piece of art. (Enzo laughs)"
41772,Caroline," Okay, that's fascinating. Can you just get here? I'm--I'm conducting an experiment."
41773,Stefan, What kind of experiment?
41774,Caroline, I'll show you when you get here. Just hurry. (she hangs up)
41775,Enzo," You know what, mate? You can keep that piece of art. Photography bores me. I withdraw my bid. (Enzo walks away, drinking his wine.)"
41776,Damon, Hey.
41777,Elena, How are you here right now?
41778,Damon," Jo's invisibility spell. If you can see us, that means you joined the party."
41779,Jo," (looking faint) Come on, we need to get out of here."
41780,Elena," My ring, it's gone. Kai melted it into nothing."
41781,Damon, (grabs Elena's hand and looks for her ring) What?
41782,Jo," I hate to cut this reunion short, but meter's running on this spell."
41783,Elena," Well, there's the tunnels under the school."
41784,Damon, Good call. Boiler room. Stat. Come on.
41785,Damon," (turns to Jo, whose back is now to him) You good?"
41786,Jo, I'm good (wipes the bl*od from her nose away)
41787,Tyler, What the hell are you talking about? You said you and Luke were equal in strength.
41788,Liv," (walking ahead of Tyler, down the hall) Well, I lied. He's stronger."
41789,Tyler, Then we run.
41790,Liv," Run where, Tyler? (Liv stops and turns to face Tyler) We already tried that. My family will hunt me down. They want me to merge."
41791,Tyler, Fine. Then go.
41792,Liv, Screw you.
41793,Tyler," I'm serious. Go. That's what you want me to say, right? So, go. Walk right into your own grave, if that's what you want. I won't stop you."
41794,Liv, I knew you were a mistake. This whole thing was a mistake. 
41795,Tyler, This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't a mistake.
41796,Luke," (sighs) I called dad, told him we're out."
41797,Tyler, I thought you were about following your destiny.
41798,Luke, Not if my destiny equals k*ll my sister. 
41799,Luke, (returning the smile with a small laugh) I told you I can think for myself.
41800,Elena," (stops and looks back at Jo, whose nose is still bleeding) You okay?"
41801,Jo, Yeah. Three people is just a lot more to cloak than two.
41802,Damon, Woah. Why is your nose bleeding?
41803,Kai," (standing at the end of the hall, smirking) I have a guess. Magic's hard. Isn't it, Jo?"
41804,Jo," (wipes the bl*od from her nose, crying) I'm so sorry."
41805,Damon," Don't sweat it. I want him to see me while I kick his ass. Now, get out of here, okay?"
41806,Damon, Where's Elena?
41807,Kai," (sarcastically) Oh, are we not cloaking people anymore? I thought that's what this was."
41808,Kai," (appearing beside his illusion of himself) That's gotta hurt. I am  definitely getting the hang of this. Cloaking spells, illusions. You know, it's all the same wheelhouse."
41809,Kai," No that I've got the kinks worked out, we can actually do this. Is there an upcoming celestial even that interests you? I'm partial to--(an arrow sh**t through Kai's shoulder) Ugh!"
41810,Jo, I'm okay. (Alaric pulls her into a hug)
41811,Colin," Come on, baby. Come on. (he laughs and hits the vending machine when his candy gets stuck, making it fall out. A nurse comes over and pats him on the shoulder) You have no idea how long it's been since I've had an appetite."
41812,Caroline," An hour ago, he was dying of brain cancer. Now, look at him. (Stefan sighs) Smile, Stefan! This is good news! My bl*od worked, he's totally fine."
41813,Stefan, It seems too easy.
41814,Caroline," As opposed to what? Vampire bl*od heals a stab wound like it was never there. It's always easy, Stefan. It is literally magic."
41815,Stefan," Okay, then why have I never heard of our bl*od curing cancer before?"
41816,Caroline, Because vampires don't spend their lives pulling charity work at the sick ward.
41817,Stefan," Look, I want this to work, okay? I do--"
41818,Caroline," Stefan, I just...I need you to believe it will work. Or at the very least, just believe that I believe it will work."
41819,Stefan," (sighs) Well, I can see that you believe it."
41820,Caroline, (smiles) Then take me home to my mom.
41821,Stefan, Okay. Let's go home.
41822,Caroline, (grinning) Okay.
41823,Stefan, Come on. (they walk away)
41824,Damon," Okay, okay. (Elena gasps in pain as Damon pulls out a last splinter)"
41825,Damon, What? What's wrong? Didn't I get it? What?
41826,Elena, There must be another splinter still stuck in my heart. (Elena's breathing is labored)
41827,Damon," What? (he starts feeling around inside Elena, looking for the splinter) No. No, no, no, no. Hey, look at me. I'll get it."
41828,Elena," (shakes her head, gasping in pain) If there's any-anything you need to say--"
41829,Damon," What? I'll find it, Elena."
41830,Elena, Now's the time.
41831,Damon," Come on. No. (Elena is breathing hard and it slowly turns to laughter. Damon looks at her and starts smiling, relaxing) Seriously?"
41832,Elena," (nods, still laughing) Yeah. (she playfully slaps Damon on the shoulder) Oldest trick in the book."
41833,Damon, (turns to face them) (sarcastically) Perfect timing.
41834,Alaric," Elena, are you okay?"
41835,Elena," (she is holding Damon's hand, smiling) I've never felt more alive. "
41836,Enzo," (to the instructor from earlier) What is it about Sarah's work that I find so uniquely appealing? Perhaps that it's a little dark, has a morbid undertone. Must be a bloodlines thing. Her family's a bit extreme. (Enzo walks over to stand beside the instructor) Her uncle, great-uncle, actually, fourth-removed, is a bloody sociopath."
41837,Instructor, Fourth removed?
41838,Enzo," He's very old. Tried to k*ll me a few times. Succeeded once. Most recently, he set me up to die, which resulted in days of torture. (Enzo walks over to stand in front of the Instructor, who is looking at him like he's crazy) There I was, getting prodded with a fire-hot poker by a man named Tripp, all the while, keeping my mouth shut and enjoying the pain. If you knew anything about my past, you'd know that this brought back some very unpleasant memories. That's when I started plotting my revenge."
41839,Instructor," So, I see the free wine was a big hit."
41840,Enzo," The best revenge is patient. Cultivated. (Enzo turns to look at Sarah's photography) Only no one sees it coming until it's too late. (he turns back to the instructor, compelling her) But never mind all that. Be a doll and help me box up all these photographs, will you?"
41841,Jo, (to Alaric) Sure you're okay having a Pentobarbital-ed houseguest?
41842,Alaric, (smiling) I am. If it buys us enough time to get you back into fighting shape.
41843,Elena," (shyly, to Damon) So, um, assuming that I don't get kidnapped before tomorrow, maybe we can, um, try for that dinner again?"
41844,Damon," Ooh, you know, I don't know. I mean, every time we try and go on a date, we get kidnapped, I get sent to a prison world, or your feelings get compelled away. I just--I don't know if it's gonna--"
41845,Elena, Are you gonna keep sulking or are you gonna let me take you to dinner?
41846,Damon," Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow."
41847,Jo," (to Elena) I can help you clean that if you want. One part amonia, two parts meat tenderizer."
41848,Elena, You invented a stain remover?
41849,Jo," I'm not afraid of a little bl*od. (Elena shrugs, smiles and follows Jo out of the room)"
41850,Alaric," (to Damon) What'd I tell you? She's a keeper. (Alaric sits at the table with Damon, putting two glasses of bourbon on the table) You know, I think she's gonna get a handle on this."
41851,Damon," Jo's not strong enough, Ric."
41852,Alaric," Well, she wouldn't lie about it."
41853,Damon," No, no, no. I don't think she's lying about it. He absorbed a spell the size of Mystic Falls, Ric. He changed the game."
41854,Alaric," Look, we got Kai on ice. We'll just wait for his stolen magic to drain away and then she'll b*at him."
41855,Damon, What if she can't?
41856,Alaric," Well, she has to. She will. "
41857,Damon," Well, all right then. Here's to women who make crazy, screwed up decisions and loving them more for it. (they cheers, take a drink) "
41858,Caroline," So, if Sarah is Zach's daughter, then does that make you Uncle Stefan?"
41859,Stefan," (jokingly) I tell you this secret I've been keeping for 18 years, and that's what you're worried about?"
41860,Caroline," No, I think it's incredibly noble that you've been keeping an eye on her all these years. And she's lucky to have you in her life, even if she has no idea. "
41861,Stefan," Hey, so, I know it goes without saying, but I would appreciate it it--"
41862,Caroline," Your secret's safe with me, Stefan."
41863,Stefan, Thank you.
41864,Caroline," No, thank you. Thank you for coming with me today and for rewiring my mom's speaker system and for just not treating me like a crazy person, because that's how I've felt these past few days. (Stefan takes her hand; they both look at their hands, then into each other's eyes; Caroline takes a deep breath and exhales) So, thank you. Wish me luck."
41865,Matt," Hey, there you are. We were just about to watch another movie."
41866,Liz," How was Duke, sweetie?"
41867,Caroline," It was good. It was really good. Thanks for staying with her, Matt."
41868,Matt," Anytime. See you soon, Sheriff."
41869,Liz," Okay, Matt. Bye."
41870,Caroline, (Matt heads for the door) Bye. (Caroline takes off her coat and puts it on the couch with her purse) So I met with that expert at Duke today. (Caroline sits on the coffee table in front of Liz) And she said that your doctors are doing everything right. And she also said that there is nothing that they can do to cure you.
41871,Liz," (looking disappointed, but obviously trying to be strong for Caroline) That is one doctor's opinion."
41872,Caroline," Waiting for more medical opinions isn't going to change this. You're dying, mom. And we're out of options. Which is why I gave my bl*od to a cancer patient today. And I healded him."
41873,Caroline," He was dying and my bl*od healed him. (Liz looks shocked) Look, I'm immortal and you're not. And I always knew that I would lose you one day, but I am not ready to lose you now. You're supposed to be here for my college graduation; we're supposed to argue about flower arrangements for my wedding. We're supposed to have years and years worth of birthday dinners and Christmases and white-water rafting trips. (Caroline is on the verge of tears) I want all of that. I want you to live for me. And I know that that's selfish, but that's the truth."
41874,Liz," (crying) I want that too, honey."
41875,Caroline, Okay.
41876,Colin," Somebody, please! Help me!"
41877,Caroline, (to Liz) Everything's gonna be okay.
41878,Elena," I don't know what we were or what we're supposed to be, but I've never felt more alive."
41879,Jo," In our coven's tradition after their 22nd birthday, the twins merge their strength. The weaker one dies."
41880,Tyler, I'll find a way. I'm not gonna let you die.
41881,Caroline," I hate you for ruining our friendship, and I think that I deserve better than that."
41882,Stefan (V.O.)," I haven't been there for her. Caroline needed me, and I ran away."
41883,Caroline," You're dying, Mom, and we're out of options, which is why I gave my bl*od to a cancer patient, and I healed him. I am not ready to lose you now. I want you to live for me."
41884,Caroline, (to Liz) Everything's gonna be okay.
41885,Colin, Caroline Forbes.
41886,Caroline, Colin.
41887,Colin, What the hell did you do to me?
41888,Stefan, Hey.
41889,Caroline, Moms still sleeping don't wake her up.
41890,Stefan, What Happened?
41891,Caroline," I Don't know. H-he was fine when we left him at Duke, remember? He was running around and pain-free and scarfing down all that disgusting vending machine food."
41892,Stefan," Yeah? Well, clearly, he's not fine now. Wait. I thought you compelled him to forget everything after you fed him your bl*od. How did he find you?"
41893,Caroline, I don't know.
41894,Stefan, What if this bl*od isn't even his? Is there any chance that your mom signed the house over to you?
41895,Caroline," I don't know. Maybe. She's been running around like crazy, saying she need to get her ducks in a row or..."
41896,Stefan," He's a vampire, which means after you fed him your bl*od..."
41897,Caroline, He died.
41898,Elena, Calculator. Calculator. Where is the calculator? Of course. Under the catatonic serial k*ll.
41899,Damon, Hey.
41900,Elena, Hey.
41901,Damon, Sandwich?
41902,Elena, I can't. I'm late for my volunteer shift at the hospital.
41903,Damon, Ok. Ooh. That's new.
41904,Elena," Oh, yeah. Jo made me a new daylight ring. You like?"
41905,Damon, Depends. Does it work?
41906,Elena," Well, I'm here, aren't I?"
41907,Damon," Yeah, inside in the shade."
41908,Elena," I know everyone has their doubts about Jo's magic, but she has an entire month to get stronger and win the merge with Kai, so a little bit of support wouldn't k*ll anybody."
41909,Damon, Speaking of k*ll people. Still counting sheep or whatever the hell you psychopaths dream of?
41910,Elena," Look. Alaric's gone out of town to get some mystical thingamabob to give Jo an edge, and your job is to baby-sit Kai, not smother him with a pillow."
41911,Damon, Fine.
41912,Elena," And if he starts twitching or something, just give him 50 milligrams of phenobarbital."
41913,Damon," You're so cute when you're all doctorly. Oh. Hey. You forgot this. You're not free tonight by any chance, are you, because I know this little Italian joint that has eggplant so good you actually think you're eating people."
41914,Elena, Heh. And I happen to have a weird eggplant obsession.
41915,Damon, Perfect.
41916,Elena, Great. (smiles) 
41917,Damon," And I'm thinking maybe after that, go the Arthouse Theater. They're playing some pretentious French flick. "
41918,Elena," (laughs) I don't speak French, Damon. "
41919,Damon," Well, not to see the movie, silly. To hide in the back and throw popcorn at the hipsters. "
41920,Elena," (laughs, then frowns) Wait, we've gone on this date already, haven't we? (Damon says nothing) Damon, that's cheating, okay? You already know everything about me. "
41921,Damon, Cheating? Cheating is erasing all of our epic memories. That's cheating. 
41922,Elena," I'm serious. Look, if we're going to do this, then we can't just pick up where we left off. Because I don't remember where that is.  "
41923,Damon, I understand. Where would you like to start? 
41924,Elena, At the beginning. I'm off at six; you can pick me up then. 
41925,Damon, Fine. 
41926,Elena, (grabbing her things and heading for the door) Fine. 
41927,Damon, Great. 
41928,Elena, Great. 
41929,Damon, Good. 
41930,Elena, (smiling and walking out the door) Bye. 
41931,Damon, Bye (Door slams. Damon waves.) 
41932,Liv," How about Atlantis? Or like, the Sea of Tranquility? "
41933,Tyler, On the moon? 
41934,Liv, Mm-hmm.
41935,Tyler, (sighs) Ohhh. 
41936,Liv, I hear it's nice there. It's very tranquil. 
41937,Tyler, Mm-hmm.
41938,Liv, Mm-hmm. 
41939,Tyler," I'm serious. (Liv laughs) Look, pick a real place. "
41940,Liv, Why are we talking about spending Spring Break anywhere other than this tiny bed? Which we should probably leave at some point today. (kisses Tyler's neck and moves to get out of the bed) 
41941,Tyler, Ignore that (kisses Liv's shoulder) 
41942,Joshua, (on the other side of the door) Olivia? You home? 
41943,Tyler, Olivia? 
41944,Liv," (grabs her phone and checks the time) Oh, my God, he's early. "
41945,Tyler, Who's early? 
41946,Joshua," (knocks again) Sweetheart, it's your old man. "
41947,Liv," (tosses Tyler a shirt) Here, put this on. "
41948,Tyler, Your dad? What's he doing here? 
41949,Liv," He wants to take Luke and me out to dinner. Hide! (Liv opens the door and sees Joshua on the other side) Dad, hi. I thought we were meeting later. "
41950,Joshua," Well, we were, but I wanted a couple of extra minutes with my girl. "
41951,Liv, Oh. 
41952,Joshua, (hands Liv a present) Happy birthday. 
41953,Jo," (to a nurse) I adjusted Mrs. Murphy's dose of Fentanyl. Keep an eye on her, thanks. "
41954,Jo," Phesmatos tribum, plantus vivifae, plantus... Hederus. (nothing happens) "
41955,Elena, (coming up behind Jo) Should I call it? 
41956,Jo," Time of death, anybody's guess. (drops the plant in the trash) "
41957,Elena," (holding up her hand with the daylight ring) Well, in the magical win column, I just walked across campus without bursting into flame. So, there's that. "
41958,Stefan, I need help. 
41959,Jo," I had Duke over Colin's medical records. This head scan is from earlier this week. (places another scan on the board) This one was taken right here, ten minutes ago. See all that red? "
41960,Damon," Well, I'm no doctor but that guy is screwed. "
41961,Stefan," So the bl*od didn't heal him, it sped up his cancer and k*ll him. "
41962,Jo," So now, I have a stage 10 cancer patient. Which, by the way, doesn't exist. Who is beyond terminally ill and a vampire, meaning all of his emotions are heightened and he can't die. "
41963,Damon," Hey, no offense, but could someone tell me why I was called down here to listen to the story of Colin the Cancer Vamp? "
41964,Liz, (arrived with Caroline) Because Caroline fed me her bl*od last night. So the same thing is gonna happen to me. 
41965,Stefan, Hey. 
41966,Elena, Any news? 
41967,Stefan," No, not yet. It's a little outside of Jo's expertise. "
41968,Elena, (sighs) Did you know that Caroline was going to give her Mom vampire bl*od? 
41969,Stefan, Yeah. I was there when it healed Colin.
41970,Elena," And then you left and then he died, so it didn't actually heal him. It did the opposite. "
41971,Stefan, Caroline had every reason to think it would work. 
41972,Elena," Yeah, but you didn't, Stefan. You're what? Like 165 years old? You worked as a paramedic at hospitals."
41973,Stefan, So that makes me an expert in supernatural cancer-treatment.. 
41974,Elena," I just wish that you'd done a little bit more research. Or waited like, a day. "
41975,Stefan, Because you were thinking so rationally when Damon died. Right? Her mother is terminal. You didn't see the hope in her eyes when she thought that maybe her mother didn't have to die. And I didn't wanna be the one to take that away from her. 
41976,Caroline," Uhm, Jo has an idea. "
41977,Jo," Medically speaking, this is our best option. If vampire bl*od is the issue, then a full transfusion of human bl*od might stabilize her condition. "
41978,Damon," (sarcastically) Please, sound less confident, Doc. "
41979,Jo," Look, we are in uncharted territory here. This isn't just a medical problem, Damon, it's a magical one. "
41980,Damon," Well, then you're uniquely qualified. (smirks) Witch-doctor and all. "
41981,Jo," Now you believe in my magic? Gee, thanks. Unfortunately, this goes beyond any witch ability I've ever heard of. But please, if you have a better plan, I'm all ears. "
41982,Tyler, Why did you tell me your birthday was in two weeks? 
41983,Liv, (looking in her compact mirror) To avoid this exact conversation. Am I wearing too much eyeliner? 
41984,Tyler," If you and Luke are 22, that means you're old enough to merge.  "
41985,Liv," That's why Luke and I are going to bust our wonder-twin powers of persuasion, make dad think that Jo's powerful enough to over-power Kai, and Luke and I won't have to do the merge.   "
41986,Luke, (points to Liv) You're wearing way too much makeup. (points to Tyler) And he shouldn't be here. 
41987,Liv, He's not staying and why are you wearing a tie? 
41988,Luke, I'm about to ask the leader of the Gemini coven to let us out of a centuries-old tradition. I kind of need him to take me seriously. 
41989,Tyler, You should let me talk to him. 
41990,Liv, Really bad idea. Promise me that you'll stay out of it. 
41991,Tyler, What happens if you don't convince him? 
41992,Liv, We will. 
41993,Tyler," You die. You and Luke merge, Luke wins, you die. "
41994,Liv, Do you trust me? 
41995,Tyler, Do I have a choice? 
41996,Liv, Then don't worry. You're not gonna lose me. (kisses Tyler and walks away with Luke) 
41997,Elena, Hey. 
41998,Damon," Hey, the bl*od transfusions are stopping the cancer from eating her alive? Or hey, is there a sheriff-sized space available in the family crypt? "
41999,Elena, I don't know. Jo's still running some tests to find that out. She should be out in a minute. 
42000,Damon," I don't know if you remember this, but Liz and I are pretty close. "
42001,Elena, (nods) Yeah. 
42002,Damon," I mean, as far as humans go, she's...tolerable. "
42003,Elena," I can see how much you care about her, but we all do. So if there's anything we can do to fix this, trust me, we will. "
42004,Damon, Yeah. 
42005,Stefan, (comes over) Hi. 
42006,Caroline," Hey. The coffee machine's broken. Seriously, what kind of hospital is this? If you can't fix a coffee machine, then how are you supposed to be able to fix people? "
42007,Stefan, Sure you don't need some real food? There's probably a machine around here that vends (whispers) O-positive. 
42008,Caroline, (sighs and leans against the vending machine) I screwed up. Big time. Why did I feed her that bl*od? 
42009,Stefan, You were trying to help. 
42010,Caroline," No, I was trying to fix something that I had no business trying to fix. It's like textbook definition of control freak from Hell. "
42011,Stefan," Listen, you are an optimist. (Caroline sighs) You wanna believe that anything is possible and that is exactly what your mom needs to hear right now. Okay? "
42012,Caroline, That's Colin's room. 
42013,Colin, I can't die. (pulls the bar from his chest and drops it on the floor) Why can't I die? 
42014,Stefan," Hey, hey. Calm down, calm down. It's okay. It's okay. "
42015,Colin, It's not okay. I'm in agony. I can hear my tumors growing! 
42016,Caroline," Okay, we'll try to help, but just please stop hurting yourself. "
42017,Colin, (vamps over to Caroline and grabs her arms) You wanna help me? Help me die. 
42018,Caroline, Why the hell did you do that? 
42019,Damon," He made a wish, I granted it. "
42020,Caroline, God. 
42021,Damon," The bl*od transfusion didn't work. So you didn't just k*ll him, Blondie. "
42022,Stefan," That's enough, Damon. "
42023,Caroline," No, it's fine. You know, he's just saying what everyone else is thinking. I k*ll my mom. "
42024,Caroline's Voice-mail," Hi, it's Caroline. Leave a message."
42025,Elena," (to Caroline's voice-mail) Caroline, where are you? Call me. Or better idea, just...just come back. "
42026,Elena, Hey. 
42027,Liz, (weakly) Hey. 
42028,Elena, How are you feeling? 
42029,Liz," Like a human pin-cushion. So, what's the verdict? Did the blood-swap work? "
42030,Elena," We're not sure yet, I mean, Jo's still doing some tests. "
42031,Liz," (nods) You shouldn't lie to sick people, Elena. It's bad karma. "
42032,Elena, They thought it was slow down the cancer cells from replicating. (Liz is trying not to cry) But it didn't work. I'm sorry.  
42033,Liz, (nods) How's Caroline? 
42034,Elena, She's good. She just ran out to get some food. 
42035,Liz, Elena... 
42036,Elena, She just took off. And now I can't find her; I can't get a hold of her. 
42037,Liz," She's not gonna forgive herself for this, is she? "
42038,Elena, Hey. (sits on the edge of the bed and takes Liz's hand) I'll make sure that we find her. I promise. 
42039,Liz, Thank you. 
42040,Caroline," Good, you're here. I actually need a second opinion. I kind of like this because sunflowers are her favorite flower, but at the same time, I was also thinking maybe they're a little too over-the-top cheerful for a memorial service. (walks over to the roses) So this was the second option, um, because roses are classic, right? I mean, especially in this shade of pink. Obviously, I would change out the vase, but--  "
42041,Caroline," If you're thinking of saying something to make me feel better, don't. I don't deserve to feel better. "
42042,Stefan, I wasn't. 
42043,Caroline, Good. 
42044,Stefan," I was actually thinking that you have far more important things to do than plan a memorial service for your mother. Who's still alive, by the way. "
42045,Caroline," Yeah, but all of this still needs to be done, right? She's not gonna want to live out the rest of her life as a vampire in excruciating pain. So I should do something that I'm good at, instead of making everything worse. Which arrangement? "
42046,Stefan," Caroline, you took a risk. It didn't pay off, but you did it out of love. You made your mother sicker, okay? But what are you gonna do now? Are you just gonna bury your head in the sand? "
42047,Caroline, I don't--I don't know what to say to her. 
42048,Stefan, You don't have to say anything to her. Just sit with her. 
42049,Caroline, (on the verge of tears) I can't. I can't even face her. 
42050,Stefan," Look, when I was young, my mom, she got really sick. And instead of spending time with her, I did everything I could to avoid her. Like picking out her favorite flowers or walking into town to get the tea that she liked. And I pretended like I was doing it for her, but I wasn't. I was just afraid to see her like that. And then my dad, he uh, he sent her away and she died. I would give anything to have one more day with her. "
42051,Caroline, What if she can't forgive me? 
42052,Stefan, She doesn't think there's anything to forgive. She just wants you to be with her. 
42053,Joshua, You're refusing to merge? 
42054,Luke, We wanna consider other options. 
42055,Joshua," There are no other options. If a set of twins doesn't merge, then the Gemini bloodline will cease to exist upon my death. That means the entire coven will die. Is that what you want? "
42056,Luke," No, of course not. But you are in perfect health, Kai is on ice. That means we have time to figure this out. "
42057,Joshua, There's nothing to figure out. This is what you were born to do. 
42058,Liv," No, dad. This is why Kai and Jo were born. We were just the backup plan you bred because you thought that your first batch had a design flaw.  "
42059,Joshua, Kai is a psychopath. An extremely dangerous one. 
42060,Liv," Dad, Jo can do this. She can win. All we're asking is that you give her a chance. "
42061,Joshua, I'm not asking you to do anything I haven't done myself. 
42062,Liv, That's easy for you to say. You merged with your twin brother and you won. You didn't drop dead.  
42063,Joshua, It doesn't work like that and you know it. One will absorb traits from the other. Both of your souls will unite into a new being. 
42064,Luke," Who looks exactly like me. Yeah, I know I'm stronger than Liv, so that means I will win if we merge. So you can put whatever poetic spin you want on it, but I will be k*ll my own sister. I can't do that to her. "
42065,Damon," Bad timing, Lockwood. I'm in a mood. What the hell are you doing? "
42066,Damon," I'll make it easier on you. I'll give you multiple choice: A: ""I'm being an idiot."" B: ""I have anger issues, and I'm a puny human now, and I have to pick on people while they sleep."" C: ""A and B are both correct."""
42067,Tyler, Liv's dad is in town. 
42068,Damon, Really? 
42069,Tyler, She's trying to convince him to let Jo and Kai do the merge. 
42070,Damon," Oh, so you just thought you'd come and grab Kai as a fail-safe in case Papa Parker says no to Liv and Luke. You just turn him loose and he merges with Jo anyway, huh? While I appreciate your efforts, he's a psycho freak magic siphon. I'm not gonna just let you walk out with him. (Damon stops. Having an idea, he slaps Tyler on the shoulder) I could kiss you right now, you beautiful moron. "
42071,Tyler, What are you talking about? 
42072,Damon," Yep, that stuff works really well. Nighty-night. That should keep you down for an hour. "
42073,Liv, Not a good time.  
42074,Damon," (on the other line) Well, I'm sorry to hear that Twinderella. Big pitch going south, is it? "
42075,Liv, Where's Tyler? 
42076,Damon," Well, the good news is, your boyfriend and I, I think, have come up with a solution. Now it's a bit of a Hail Mary, but I think everybody gets what they need. I just have to ask Papa Parker one question, so do you mind putting him on?  "
42077,Liv, I want to talk to Tyler. 
42078,Damon," He's, uh, out at the moment. "
42079,Joshua, Yes? 
42080,Damon," Hello, sir. Damon Salvatore here. We had Thanksgiving together. Anyway, I've been sitting here Googling celestial events happening today and I was just curious: Would a Mercury-Venus conjunction give you enough juice to do a little Gemini merge party?  "
42081,Joshua, Why? 
42082,Damon," I'm gonna take that evasive answer as a yes. So, here's the situation: I'm gonna need you to use that planet party to merge your set of blonde twins ASAP. Because, well, unfortunately, your formerly comatose son is gonna be on the loose and Hell-bent on b*at you to the punch. "
42083,Damon," Rise and shine, you little weasel. "
42084,Damon," Oohh, trying to pop a bl*od vessel in my brain? Sorry. Not gonna work. Looks like all that magic you sucked up drained away while you were asleep, which is good for me. Don't worry, I know where you can get more. "
42085,Kai, You really think I'm gonna trust you? 
42086,Damon, No. And I'm not gonna trust you. I just happen to need a magic siphon and you're the only game in town. 
42087,Kai," (looks down at Tyler and hops over him, off the bed) (to Tyler) Hi. (to Damon) Let's discuss my fee. "
42088,Kai," All right. I need a 12-gauge needle, stat. I don't know what I'm gonna do with it, but I need it. "
42089,Elena," You're not a doctor, so stop playing games. Because I am a vampire and I will rip your head off if you screw this up. "
42090,Damon, What she said. So do your stupid little magic-suction trick and suck the magic out of her. Right now. 
42091,Kai," I get what you two see in each other. It's very dys-fun-ctional. Ha! You see what I did, stressing the ""fun"" in dysfunctional?"
42092,Liz," Just get on with it, Kai. Listening to you talk makes me wanna die. "
42093,Kai, (amused) That's good. 
42094,Damon, Is it working? 
42095,Elena, I have no idea. 
42096,Jo, What the hell is going on? What is he doing here? 
42097,Kai," Hey, sis. Little busy. Be with you in a jiffy. "
42098,Jo, Elena? 
42099,Elena, I'm gonna let Damon explain. 
42100,Damon, Yeah.  
42101,Elena, (to Kai) I'm staying with you. 
42102,Jo, Have you actually lost your mind? 
42103,Damon," Hey, shh. Listen. You told me Liz was gonna die in eight hours if the magic kept doing it's thing. He steals magic. You made it through med school, I figured you knew where I was going with this. "
42104,Jo," If you think Kai is doing this out of the goodness of his heart, I can assure you: he doesn't have one. What's the price? "
42105,Damon, He wants to merge. Tonight. 
42106,Kai, There. All done.  
42107,Elena," Sheriff, hey. How are you feeling? Are you okay? "
42108,Liz," Yeah. Yeah, I think so.  "
42109,Elena," Oh, my God. I think she's having a heart-attack.  "
42110,Kai," Oh, that is so tragic. You know, 'cause you guys jumped through hoops to get the magic out of her system, but then her ticker's just not strong enough to take a little siphoning. "
42111,Elena," Kai, you have to fix this! "
42112,Jo, I can't merge tonight. I'm not ready. 
42113,Damon," You almost b*rned my house down. Don't you think I know that? Luckily for you, it's all be taken care of. "
42114,Jo," Damon, what the hell did you do? "
42115,Kai, Magical neck-snap. Never gets old. Isn't this the part where you start running? 
42116,Jo, I've spent my entire life running from you. I'm not running anymore. 
42117,Liv, What are you doing out here? 
42118,Joshua, Just thinking about how proud I am of you and your brother. Built a good life for yourselves here.   
42119,Luke, Does that mean you'll think about what we asked? 
42120,Joshua," Of course. We share a history. A bloodline. (Joshua hold out his hands, one to each of them) We're in this together. We're family.  "
42121,Joshua," Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. (Liv and Luke both start experiencing pain) Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. "
42122,Luke, You're merging us? 
42123,Joshua, Kai has been released. He's going after Jo. I can't let him get to her. 
42124,Liv," Dad, stop! "
42125,Luke," I'm gonna k*ll her! She's not strong enough, dad. "
42126,Joshua, I'm sorry. 
42127,Luke," She's not strong enough, dad! "
42128,Joshua," There's no other option. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. "
42129,Tyler, She said no! 
42130,Tyler, (to Liv) He was going to k*ll you. 
42131,Liv, I'm fine. I'm fine.  
42132,Liv," Luke, where are you going? "
42133,Luke, You trust me? 
42134,Liv, Where are you going? 
42135,Luke, I'll be back soon. I promise.  
42136,Kai," Look at those pretty planets, all twinkly and bright. Oh, Josette, you would not believe how sick I am of eclipses. "
42137,Jo, Let's just get this over with. 
42138,Kai," (cutting his hand open) You know, if you think I didn't spend the last 18 years in solitary thinking about you screwed me over last time, you're wrong. So if this is just another setup, I'll rip something out more important than a spleen. Like a tongue or a heart. So, any closing remarks? "
42139,Jo," You're a parasite. You k*ll the people I loved, you shoved a hunting kn*fe in my gut. You destroyed my life. Now I'm gonna destroy yours. "
42140,Kai, I guess we'll see. Won't we? 
42141,Jo," (Kai and Jo hold hands) Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. "
42142,Jo and Kai," Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus.Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. "
42143,Kai, What the hell did you just do? 
42144,Luke," Oh, I just gave my big sister a little magic knock on the head. But don't worry, she'll be fine. Because you're gonna merge with me. "
42145,Kai," Oh, oh, oh. You want to merge with me. I hate to break it to you, little brother, but we're not twins, all right? That's not how this is supposed to work."
42146,Luke," Well, that's true, but we share the same parents, the same bloodline, and thanks to your timeout in the magic penalty box, we're the same age, so it's definitely a hail Mary, and--and maybe it won't work, but I'd do anything to save my sister's life, so... (cuts his hand and tosses the kn*fe on the ground) .. we're gonna give it the old college try. "
42147,Kai," Thanks, but I'm gonna pass. "
42148,Luke," Phasmatos motus arrovox. (magically pulls Kai to him, holding his face with one hand) What's wrong? Are you afraid to play chicken with someone who might actually b*at you? "
42149,Kai, (shoves Luke's hand away) Fine. (grabs Luke's cut hand) It's your funeral. 
42150,Elena," Stay with me, Sheriff. Just...breathe! "
42151,Damon," Elena, hey. What happened? "
42152,Elena," It's her heart. I'm losing her, Damon.  "
42153,Damon," Okay, no offense Elena, but I think we need to get a real doctor. "
42154,Elena, So find one! Now! 
42155,Kai and Luke," Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis finantus. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. "
42156,Jo," Luke, no! "
42157,Kai and Luke," Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. Sanguinem desimilus-- "
42158,Jo," Luke, no! "
42159,Kai and Luke," Sanguinem generis fiantus. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus.  "
42160,Jo, Luke! Stop! 
42161,Kai and Luke," Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. Sanguinem desimilus, sanguinem generis fiantus. "
42162,Jo," No! (gets up and goes over to Luke, cradling his head in her lap) Luke, come on. Luke, Luke wake up.  "
42163,Doctor, How long has she been down? 
42164,Damon, What's the mean? Dead? 
42165,Elena, I-I don't know. (doctor is charging shock pads) Maybe I think it was a minute. It feels like an hour. 
42166,Doctor, Clear! (shocks Liz) 
42167,Liz, Caroline? 
42168,Liz," Honey, I'm leaving. You wanna say goodbye? "
42169,Damon," Uh-uh. Hey, I compelled you to save her. (grabs the shock pads and shoves them back at the doctor) Unless you want me to gouge your eyes out, I suggest you keep working. Here. "
42170,Doctor, I've done all that I can do. She's gone. I'm sorry. 
42171,Damon, (compelling the doctor) Get out of here. Forget you're a total failure. 
42172,Elena," No, no. (starts compressions again) I will not let this happen. Wake up! "
42173,Damon," (puts a hand on Elena's back) Hey, she's gone.  "
42174,Elena, Come on. 
42175,Caroline," No. No, no, no! Mom, Mom, Mom! (shaking her mom) Mommy! No, Mom! No. (crying) Don't leave me, please. Please, no. Please don't leave me, Mom. "
42176,Liz," Caroline? Can you hear me, sweetheart? (Caroline doesn't move or reply) It's time for me to go. (Liz puts the suitcase down and walks over to Caroline) You don't wanna say goodbye to your mom? (Liz grabs Caroline's shoulder and gently makes Caroline face her) "
42177,Caroline, Mom? 
42178,Liz," It's okay, baby, I'm right here. "
42179,Caroline, (crying) Mom. 
42180,Liz," Ohh, it's okay. I'm right here. I'm right here, baby. It's okay, it's okay. "
42181,Damon, (to Elena) Where you going? 
42182,Elena," I need some air or some water or something. 'Cause...she almost died in my arms, Damon. Caroline's Mom almost died in my arms.  "
42183,Damon," I thought you wanted to start over. Because, FYI, this is exactly where we left off. "
42184,Elena," I don't care. Life's too short. Immortal or not, I don't want to waste another minute. "
42185,Liz," Hello, stranger. "
42186,Caroline, Hi. 
42187,Liz, Are you okay? 
42188,Caroline," (nods) I've just been sitting here, trying to figure out what to say. I guess I should lead with: I'm sorry for almost k*ll you. "
42189,Liz," (laughs) Oh, sweetheart, please. You know me, I'm the world's unluckiest gambler. "
42190,Caroline, I'm just sorry that I wasn't here. I couldn't-- 
42191,Liz," No, no, no, no. This wasn't your fault. I need you to stop b*at yourself up. Can you do that for me? "
42192,Caroline, Okay. 
42193,Liz, Can you say it like you mean it? 
42194,Caroline," I will. Mom, you put the house in my name. "
42195,Liz, (nods) Couple weeks ago. Just in case anything... 
42196,Caroline," Yeah. Well, I don't... I'm not ready for that yet. "
42197,Liz, I'm sorry. And I promise you: I will stick around as long as I can. Okay? 
42198,Caroline, (nods) Okay. 
42199,Liz, Come here. (they hug) 
42200,Caroline, Hey. 
42201,Stefan, Hey. 
42202,Caroline, Where'd you get that? 
42203,Stefan, I guess someone fixed the coffee machine. (gives Caroline the coffee) 
42204,Liz," That smells amazing. I would give you a million dollars for a decaf latte. What do you say? Would you mind getting one for your poor, sick mom? "
42205,Caroline, I can do that. I'll be right back. (gets up and leaves the room) 
42206,Liz," (to Stefan) So, looks like we can cross miracle cure off the list. "
42207,Stefan, Must be some other option. 
42208,Liz, I need you promise me something. 
42209,Stefan, Okay. 
42210,Liz," When I'm gone, Caroline is gonna need you. Even if she doesn't know it. She's gonna need someone to help her move on with her life. Someone to just make her smile. (crying) Promise me that you will do that, Stefan.  "
42211,Stefan, (takes Liz's hand) I promise. 
42212,Jo," Luke. Luke, wake up. Luke.  "
42213,Damon, Good. You're still alive. That's gonna save me a huge blowout with Ric when he gets back. (looks at Luke and Kai on the ground) I am definitely coming into something late. 
42214,Jo, Luke showed up and he merged with Kai. 
42215,Damon," Huh. So I guess adding the words 'twin merge' to my vocabulary was pointless, 'cause they ain't twins. "
42216,Jo," He's not supposed to be here. The only reason he's here is because you let Kai out! Luke. Luke, wake up. Wake up, Luke. "
42217,Damon," Well, uh, let me give him some of my bl*od. "
42218,Jo, It wouldn't help. It's up to them now. Whoever wakes up is the winner. And whoever doesn't...(Luke takes a breath and opens his eyes) Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
42219,Liv, Why the hell won't Luke call me back? 
42220,Tyler, Do you want me to go look for him? 
42221,Liv, Yes. No! I don't know. (Joshua wakes up) Dad. 
42222,Joshua, (gets to his feet) What has your brother done? 
42223,Jo," Luke? Wake up, Luke. (Luke opens his eyes. Jo feels for a pulse.) Oh, my God. "
42224,Joshua, (holds his hand out to Liv) We have to leave. Now. 
42225,Tyler, She's not going anywhere with you. 
42226,Joshua, Luke is gone.  
42227,Liv, What? 
42228,Joshua, I can feel it. He merged with Kai and Kai won. Luke is gone. 
42229,Liv, (crying) I don't believe you. 
42230,Joshua," (grabs Liv's arm) We have to run, Olivia! "
42231,Liv, I'm not going anywhere with you! 
42232,Joshua, (about Tyler) You think he's gonna keep you safe? 
42233,Tyler, She's staying with me! 
42234,Joshua," If you change your mind, you know where to find us.  "
42235,Jo," (crying) Oh, my God. Luke. He's gone. He saved me and he's gone. "
42236,Kai," You win some, you lose some.  "
42237,Kai, Except for me. I always win. 
42238,Damon, Where the hell are we?
42239,Bonnie, 1994.
42240,Kai," To get home, we'll harness the power of the Ascendant."
42241,Elena, What about Bonnie?
42242,Damon, She sacrificed herself so I could come back.
42243,Damon (V.O.), She's all alone.
42244,Jeremy," We miss you, Bonnie."
42245,Bonnie (V.O.), I miss you guys.
42246,Elena, I'm sorry I compelled away the memories.
42247,Damon, We'll make new ones.
42248,Liz," I need you to promise me something. When I'm gone, Caroline is gonna need you to help her move on with her life. Promise me that you will do that, Stefan."
42249,Stefan, (takes Liz's hand) I promise.
42250,Jo," In our coven's tradition, the twins merge their strength. The weaker one dies."
42251,Luke," I know I'm stronger than Liv, so that means I will win if we merge."
42252,Joshua, One twin will absorb traits from the other. Both of your souls will unite into a new being.
42253,Both, Desimilus...
42254,Jo," Luke, don't!"
42255,Kai and Luke, Sanguinem generis finatus.
42256,Joshua, Luke is gone. He merged with Kai. Kai won.
42257,Kai," You win some, you lose some except for me. I always win."
42258,Bonnie," Happy Birthday, Bonnie."
42259,Elena," (struggling with balloons and birthday supplies)  Hey. You want to--ugh-- give me a hand, please?"
42260,Jeremy, Little busy here. (exhales and continues to lift)
42261,Elena, Ok. Fine. Then you are on decoration duty. It's Bonnie's birthday.
42262,Jeremy, I know what today is.
42263,Elena," Then you know how she would have wanted us to spend it. She would have wanted us to celebrate by cooking her favorite foods, watching her favorite movies."
42264,Jeremy,  So we're throwing a birthday party where the guest of honor never shows up. That's not depressing.
42265,Elena," Or we could celebrate you going to art school. Oh, wait. We can't because I found your application in the garbage. Why didn't you tell me that you were thinking about going to art school?"
42266,Jeremy, (sits up)  I'm not. The only class I'm passing is study hall. They'll never let me in.
42267,Elena," Jer, I've seen your portfolio. You're good."
42268,Jeremy,  Doesn't matter. I'm not leaving without knowing Bonnie's OK or not.
42269,Caroline," (on the phone with her Mom) Mom, I'm not calling to check up on you, OK? I'm just about to start making Bonnie's birthday cake and want to make sure that your recipe called for 3 eggs instead of 4, right? All right. I'm just a phone call away in case you need any-- (her Mom has already ended the call) bye."
42270,Caroline," Is it just me, or do her eyes follow you around the room?"
42271,Stefan, (looks at the bear) Hmm. It's definitely you.
42272,Caroline, I haven't seen Miss Cuddles in 12 years.
42273,Stefan," Well, that's the bear Bonnie sent back from 1994. I guess she lost the original."
42274,Caroline," No. She didn't lose her. I took her. (turns the bear around) Yeah. When Bonnie and I were little, we got in this huge fight, so to get back at her, I bearnapped Miss Cuddles, and then I didn't want my Mom to come home and find out, so then I buried her in the woods. I even left some M&M's to mark the spot where I left her, but something must have eaten them."
42275,Stefan," Well, I'm pretty sure that Bonnie is over it by now."
42276,Caroline, Miss Cuddles isn't. She's out there all alone like Bonnie. You know what? I'm gonna go find her.
42277,Stefan, You're gonna what?
42278,Caroline, Yeah. It's Bonnie's birthday. (puts on her jacket)
42279,Stefan," Wait, wait. Hold on. Caroline, you've been going through a lot lately. Do you think that maybe you're just a little confused about what you're actually upset about?"
42280,Caroline," Yes, probably, but my Mom's dying, and my best friend is stuck in an alternate universe, and her bear is in a hole in the woods, and there's only one of those things that I can do anything about."
42281,Stefan, Right.
42282,Damon," (looks at the cupcakes) Happy Birthday, Bon-bon."
42283,Elena, (walks in) Ahh.
42284,Damon, Hi.
42285,Elena, (takes off her jacket and sees the cupcakes) Ooh. You think we could sneak one before the party?
42286,Damon, I think Caroline might fry us in the sun.
42287,Elena, It's worth the risk.  (takes a bite of a cupcake) Mmm. Mmm.
42288,Damon, Come here. (wipes some frosting from her lips)
42289,Elena," You know, we never talked about the fact that you kissed me."
42290,Damon, And you kissed me back? (takes a bite of the cupcake) Yeah. I know. That's the whole point of kissing so you don't have to talk about it.
42291,Elena," Right. Well, I just wanted you to know that I'm good with that."
42292,Damon, Yeah?
42293,Elena, Yeah. We--we're good. Really good. Ha.
42294,Damon, Was this the talk?
42295,Elena, Pretty much.
42296,Damon, Perfect. (kisses)
42297,Kai, (calls from the front door) Hello?
42298,Elena, (pulls away) No. That's impossible because why would he--
42299,Damon," He didn't. He's all merged, he's packed, and his on his way to Portland!"
42300,Kai, (walks in) Ooh! Forgot how massive this house was. (smiles) Yum! Cupcakes! Sorry. Am I interrupting something?
42301,Damon, (annoyed) What are you doing here?
42302,Kai, Funniest thing. I need your help. (takes out a letter)
42303,Elena, Why would we give a letter to Jo?
42304,Kai," I haven't been able to find her using a locator spell, and, you know, good on her because under normal circumstances, I'd superjazzed to gouge out her belly button. (eats cupcake)"
42305,Elena," Why would we help you, Kai?"
42306,Kai," Well, in case you haven't figured it out by now, I'm a sociopath. (Elena feigns shock) I know. Shocker. I like being a sociopath. You know, I'm not burdened by things like guilt or love. So then this merge happened with my brother Luke, and I won, which was great because I absorbed his ability to do magic, but now I can't stop thinking about how Luke died, how Liv's life is ruined. For some horrible reason, I can't shake how badly I feel about it. (sighs with frustration)"
42307,Elena, (surprised) You feel bad?
42308,Kai," Yeah. So when I absorbed Luke's magic, I must have gotten some of his qualities or something like empathy. So I googled how to process emotional pain, and they said if you write everything down in a letter and burn it, you'll be healed. So I started writing, and this water literally started pooling in my eyes. Has that ever happened to you, like--like water just--just oozing out of my eyeballs like I'm some alien creature excreting fluids."
42309,Elena, You mean you cried.
42310,Kai," Yes! And after that was done, I b*rned the letter, and the feelings--oop-- were still there. So I really feel strongly that Jo needs to know how sorry I am for destroying our family, but let's face it, guys, all right? I mean, Elena, you of all people should be willing to look past the questionable things that I've done to see that there's--there's good somewhere in me. You did it with Damon."
42311,Damon, (even more annoyed) OK. I think we're done here. Come on.
42312,Elena," Actually, what if there's something he can do for us in exchange? (smiles)"
42313,Matt, So I'm guessing you didn't bring me out here to watch you perv out on some co-ed.
42314,Enzo," It's not just some co-ed. Meet the real Sarah Salvatore, the hothouse flower Stefan's been keeping secret all these years."
42315,Matt, Why do you even care?
42316,Enzo," Because Damon thinks he k*ll Sarah, and instead of absolving him, Stefan's been using Damon's guilt to keep him in check. Not very brotherly now, is it?"
42317,Matt, So I help you destroy some innocent girl or what? You're gonna k*ll me? Then go ahead and k*ll me.
42318,Enzo," I don't want to k*ll you, Matt. I just want you to do a few simple tasks."
42319,Matt, Screw you! I'm not gonna be your bitch for the rest of my life.
42320,Enzo," (grabs Matt's throat) I don't want to k*ll you, but I will k*ll you. Oh. Look at that. Very brave. I admire your tolerance for pain. Does that run in your family? Just wondering if your mother shares your pain threshold. Took a drive down to South Carolina to take a peek at mama Donovan. Quite a dish, that one. (Gasps, Coughs) Good. Now that that's settled, it's time for you to get to know Sarah Salvatore."
42321,Kai, (examines the ascendant) Sad attempt at iron welding.
42322,Elena, I tried to fix it.
42323,Kai, I can't bring Bonnie back with this.
42324,Elena, I thought you were the all-powerful leader of the Gemini coven now.
42325,Kai, I destroyed this so that it couldn't be used again.
42326,Elena," Well, can we use that hunk of junk to send a message at least? It is her birthday."
42327,Kai, (slightly saddened) It is?
42328,Damon," Yeah. It's really sad. I mean, old Bon-bon-- she's gonna be getting all dressed up for a party no one's even gonna show up to. I mean, I wonder if she even knows that it is her birthday, or do all the days just blend into one vast sea of misery? I wonder."
42329,Kai, One of the crown wheels survived. That's a positive. Plus I am megapowerful.
42330,Damon, Yeah. What do you want to say?
42331,Liv," (cries, while holding a white dress) I was gonna wear this for the merge ceremony. It's the dress I would have died in. (throws it in a garbage can) How could Luke do this?"
42332,Tyler," He didn't do this to you. Kai did, and he's going to finish what he started by k*ll you and every other Gemini. So grab whatever you need, and let's get out of here, or else will have died for nothing."
42333,Liv," Just haul ass out of here like my dad? Live out the rest of my life wondering is today the day that Kai finds me? I should have just done the stupid merge. At least then, Luke and I would still be together. All our lives, we've never been apart. I don't know how to do this."
42334,Tyler," I'm so sorry, Liv."
42335,Liv," I can't run, Tyler. Kai took my entire life. There's nowhere for me to go."
42336,Tyler," Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. Whatever you want to do, I will help you get through it."
42337,Liv, Fine. Then I want to k*ll Kai.
42338,Elena, Ok. So we know that Jo stored her magic in a hunting kn*fe. Bonnie sent hers over with Miss Cuddles. What receptacle of magic am I not thinking of?
42339,Damon, Let me give you a hint: scorned lover.
42340,Elena, Katherine?
42341,Damon, Older.
42342,Elena, Silas.
42343,Damon, Hotter.
42344,Elena, I don't know. Silas was definitely hot.
42345,Damon, (disgusted) Ugh.
42346,Elena, Qetsiyah. (He winks at her) Her bl*od is on Silas' headstone. It's filled with magic.
42347,Damon," Yep! So in Bonnieland, that means that an island off Nova Scotia is a big magical battery waiting to be tapped. We just need to remind Bonnie of that."
42348,Elena, (curious) And what reminded you?
42349,Damon," I was gonna plan a trip there, change of scenery, you know. There's only so much you can take of Mystic Falls on repeat."
42350,Kai," (relieved) Oh, thank God. You two together is still totally revolting to me. Finally, a familiar feeling. Luke didn't take me over completely."
42351,Jeremy, What the hell's he doing here?
42352,Kai, (smiles) Hi. 
42353,Caroline," You know, if you were gonna creepily stalk me, you could have at least brought a shovel."
42354,Stefan, Nah. I'm not big on digging. Calluses.
42355,Caroline, You bury corpses all the time.
42356,Stefan," Yeah, but I don't dig them up. So do you really think that finding a Teddy Bear will make everything right in the world?"
42357,Caroline," You know what? You are right. This is such a waste of time. I really should be at the dive bar, picking a fight with a stranger in order to feel pain."
42358,Stefan, Ooh.
42359,Caroline," Look. If you think I'm insane, I get it. I probably am, but nobody is forcing you to be here."
42360,Stefan," I should probably stay, keep an eye on you, you know, in case you have a psychotic breakdown."
42361,Jeremy, People don't just change like that.
42362,Damon, People usually don't merge with their siblings either.
42363,Kai," Uh, for the record, I would have been fine with any of Luke's qualities, you know, the hair, the whole gay thing-- you know, maybe not the height actually."
42364,Jeremy, You seriously buy this?
42365,Elena," Look. I'm not saying that we have to like him, but if there's a way for us to tell Bonnie how she can get out--"
42366,Jeremy, We should trust a guy that changed personalities overnight?
42367,Kai," Think of it like Elena in reverse. (pours himself a drink) You know, she was human, pure, dating the good Salvatore. Then she became an undead bl*od vacuum, stopped caring about right and wrong, and started dating the bad one."
42368,Elena, (irritated) That's not how it happened.
42369,Kai," Hmm. I'm sure I missed a detail or two, but I'm just paraphrasing what Damon told me in the prison world."
42370,Damon," Speaking of, there's a witch over there we'd like to save, so why don't you get your Gemini jumper cables and fix that thing?"
42371,Kai, OK.
42372,Tyler, What are you doing? Liv. Come on. Talk to me. What are you doing?
42373,Liv," (stops chanting) When Luke and I were kids, we used to play hide-and-seek. We figured out a way to cheat by using a spell to see through each other's eyes.  (continues chanting)"
42374,Damon," Come on, Kai. You done yet?"
42375,Liv, The bastard's at the Salvatore house.
42376,Tyler, Why the hell would he be there?
42377,Liv," I have no idea. Of course, Damon would find a reason to work with him."
42378,Tyler," Look, Liv. I know how pissed you are right now. I get that probably more than anybody, but--"
42379,Liv," But what? I'm just supposed to live with it, get through it? Something tells me you didn't just punch a wall after your Mom died. "
42380,Tyler," Liv, stop! Like it or not, Kai is your leader. You k*ll him, your entire coven dies-- you, your dad, Jo...You."
42381,Liv," We're dead anyway. He'll k*ll his way through the coven, our friends, the guy at the drive-through who screws up his order. At least this way, I can take him with me."
42382,Tyler," Wait. I told you that if anybody tried to hurt you they'd have to get through me first. Well, guess what. That includes you."
42383,Liv (She kisses him and then starts whispering)," Phesmatos somnumia. (Tyler is quickly unconscious and Liv helps him down on the floor) I'm sorry, Tyler."
42384,Matt, (smiles) I got it. I'm guessing you're not here on a basketball scholarship.
42385,Sarah, That's not a regulation trashcan.
42386,Matt, Hey. I saw your camera. I'm thinking about buying one. You like it?
42387,Sarah, It gets the job done. What kind of photography are you into?
42388,Matt, A little bit of everything.
42389,Sarah," Ok. Well, it has good color reproduction, nice tonal range. Um, you'll want to sh**t raw if you don't want the highlights to get clipped, and...You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?"
42390,Matt," No. No, I don't. Sorry."
42391,Sarah," Well, don't feel bad. You went for it. It's not your fault you with the second most common pickup line guys use when they see a girl with a camera."
42392,Matt," Oh, yeah? What's the first?"
42393,Sarah," The offer to pose for some very tasteful nudes. Look. I'm really flattered, and I'm sure you're a nice guy, but..."
42394,Matt, No. It's OK. I get it.
42395,Sarah, Good luck with your photography.
42396,Matt, Thanks.
42397,Enzo, (appears behind Matt) You truly have an epic lack of game.
42398,Matt," I tried, OK?"
42399,Enzo," Really? Grunting at her would have been more effective. Now I've got to get you back on track. All right. Give me your jacket, your wallet, and your cell phone."
42400,Kai," So I can't send us back physically, but I can probably send a part of us back."
42401,Elena, Probably?
42402,Kai," You remember that movie ""Ghost""? Ok. Well, Bonnie's gonna be Demi Moore because she's the alive one obviously, and, uh, we'll all be a collective Patrick Swayze, the ghost. By the way, how much does that suck about Patrick Swayze?"
42403,Elena, Will she be able to us or not Kai?
42404,Kai," I don't know. I've never done this before. So let's all just take a deep breath, right, close our eyes, and... Phesmatos tribum invocio caveum, miscero mundio. Phesmatos tribum invocio caveum, miscero mundio."
42405,Damon, What happened to the pool table?
42406,Elena," Oh, my God."
42407,Jeremy, Bonnie? Bonnie! She can't hear me.
42408,Damon," (tries to touch something) And we can't touch anything either. Nice spell, Kai."
42409,Damon (on videotape), This place is my own personal hell.
42410,Bonnie, (smiles) Drama queen.
42411,Damon, Hey.
42412,Bonnie (on videotape)," Reporting to you live from retro world, I'm Bonnie Bennett. Joining us today in the studio is special guest Damon Salvatore! (Tape stops. Pours herself a glass of bourbon)"
42413,Damon, (shocked) No.
42414,Elena, (confused) What?
42415,Damon, The bottle of bourbon is the oldest one in the house. We made a pact if we couldn't take being trapped here alone for one more day we'd... We'd k*ll that entire bottle. Then we'd k*ll ourselves.
42416,Elena, (gasps) Wait. Wait. What happened? Why are we back here?
42417,Kai, I don't know. Spell must require too much magic. I lost my connection.
42418,Damon, Then reconnect.
42419,Kai, It's not that easy. (points to his nose with bl*od) You see this bl*od? I'm guessing that's not a good sign.
42420,Elena, (frustrated) Bonnie is going to k*ll herself.
42421,Jeremy, Can she do that? Can she die in the prison world?
42422,Kai," I couldn't. Of course, it was my own personal solitary confinement. Didn't want me to end my sentence early by k*ll myself. Ooh! I tried every method in the book. Heh. I drove down to D.C. Because there was this museum that has an actual guillotine."
42423,Jeremy," We get it. For whoever's not lucky enough to be you, dead means dead."
42424,Elena," We have to stop her. We have to give her hope, send her a message somehow."
42425,Jeremy, How? She couldn't hear us.
42426,Damon, The message is already there in the atlas. I scribbled some notes on Nova Scotia. We just have to get her to see it.
42427,Elena," All right, but how do we open an atlas if we can't touch anything?"
42428,Damon," We need to get Kai to crank up his witchy-woo, don't we, so we can make physical contact."
42429,Kai, All while sending the 3 of you back over there? Sure. Yeah. Hey. Why don't I reanimate your dead parents for a tea party while I'm at it? (changing attitude) Sorry. Insensitive.
42430,Jeremy, What if you just send me back?
42431,Elena, What? No.
42432,Kai, That might work. Focus all of my magic on one person. It might be enough of a boost that you could physically interact if I can hold the spell.
42433,Damon, And if you cannot?
42434,Kai," The magic overwhelms me, and I can't pull Jeremy out. He'll be stuck over there for eternity."
42435,Elena, Jer.
42436,Jeremy," Don't. Don't say anything. If I can get through to her, we save Bonnie's life. If not... At least I'll be with her when she dies."
42437,Stefan," (teasing) Hey. Is that an MMm? Where? Right there. Little to the left, little to the left. Right there, right-- oh, ohh. Sorry. It was just a leaf."
42438,Caroline, (angry) Is this funny to you?
42439,Stefan," Well, we are in the middle of the woods, searching for a Teddy bear buried in a shallow grave by a 9-year-old version of you. I can't even say that with a straight face, so, yeah, that is funny."
42440,Caroline, You're drunk. Give me that. (tries to take his drink)
42441,Stefan," No, no, no. You have more ground to cover."
42442,Caroline, (annoyed) You're a jerk.
42443,Stefan," Jerk, huh?"
42444,Caroline, Yeah.
42445,Stefan," Oh, you sound angry."
42446,Caroline," I'm not angry, OK? I'm just annoyed because I am going through a highly emotional situation right now, and you're just sitting there, mocking me."
42447,Stefan, Definitely angry.
42448,Caroline," I'm not angry, OK?"
42449,Stefan," Well, you should be. Your Mom is dying, your best friend is stuck in some netherworld, and you're sitting here trying to make it all better by finding a stuffed animal?"
42450,Caroline, (shoves him) Shut up!
42451,Stefan, That make you feel better?
42452,Caroline, No.
42453,Stefan, Try again.
42454,Caroline, (shoves him again) Screw you!
42455,Stefan, That's good. Get it out.
42456,Caroline, Oof! (both groaning) I cannot believe you just did that.
42457,Stefan," Well, you started it. Felt good, though, didn't it?"
42458,Caroline, Maybe a little. Phesmatos tribum...
42459,Elena, I didn't know you and Bonnie had a death pact.
42460,Damon," It was my idea. I thought of it after we watched ""the bodyguard"" for the billionth time."
42461,Kai, Phesmatos tribum...
42462,Damon, I never thought she'd go through with it.
42463,Kai, Invocio caveum...
42464,Damon, I can't watch this. (leaves)
42465,Kai," Phesmatos tribum invocio caveum, miscero mundio. (Elena follows Damon)"
42466,Sarah," Hey, Ansel Adams."
42467,Matt, I have no idea who that is.
42468,Sarah, Where are you trying to go?
42469,Matt, Virginia. Mystic Falls.
42470,Sarah," Virginia? (points at the bus stop sign) This is a campus bus. It has, like, 5 stops. The farthest you're gonna get is the Lenox Hospital."
42471,Matt," Great. My buddy bailed on me, and my phone and jacket are in his car."
42472,Sarah, This is why I don't visit animal shelters. Come on. I'll show you where you can catch a real bus.
42473,Matt," Oh, that'd be great. I'm--I'm freezing out here."
42474,Sarah," There's a cafe on the way. We'll get a coffee, and you can warm up."
42475,Matt, Too bad my wallet's in my jacket.
42476,Sarah, How were you planning on paying for the bus?
42477,Sarah," (laughs) Yeah. In that case, I'll buy you a bus ticket to go with that coffee."
42478,Matt, Thank you.
42479,Sarah, Come on.
42480,Damon, (Grabs the oldest bourbon in the house) Our su1c1de bourbon. Bonnie and I made a pact we'd drink this together. That's what I'm gonna do.  (drinks) Mmm.
42481,Elena,"  (takes the drink) To you, Bonnie. (drinks) Oh! So is Kai right about me? By turning into a vampire, I completely changed?"
42482,Damon, Kai's a psychopath. Don't let him get in your head.
42483,Elena," I'm not, but do you ever think about it, like, if I would still be with you if I was human?"
42484,Damon, Ok. We're doing this.
42485,Elena," It's just a question, Damon."
42486,Damon, No.
42487,Elena," ""No"" what?"
42488,Damon," No. I don't think we'd be together if you were still human. You had a choice. You chose Stefan. Human you was on your way home to him. Car went off the bridge, you turned, and suddenly, I was back in the picture."
42489,Elena," I'm gonna go check on Jer. (She can't leave the room, revealing that they're trapped by a boundary spell) What's going on?"
42490,Jeremy, Ok. 1994. Let's do this.
42491,Kai, Where's the stupid map?
42492,Jeremy, It's working.
42493,Kai, Hurry up and find Nova Scotia.
42494,Jeremy," (flips through the atlas) Nova Scotia. Got it. (He then drops the atlas, since he can't touch it anymore.) No! Kai, do something! (discovers that Kai's shirt starts getting bl*od on) Kai?"
42495,Jeremy, No! What are you doing?
42496,Kai," (laughs) Dang, sis. That was harsh."
42497,Liv, (angry) Shut up!
42498,Kai, Aah! Agh!
42499,Liv," Phesmatos. (Before Liv can do anything, Kai quickly uses his magic to throw a fork into her throat) Aah!"
42500,Kai," (stands up and grabs a bottle) Ha ha. Ha. Ahh. It's all coming back to me, Livvie poo. You know, the charge..."
42501,Liv," Stop it, Kai!"
42502,Kai, (continues) That races through your bones...
42503,Liv, (shouts) Stop it!
42504,Kai, At the prospect of watching someone burn to death? (throws the bottle away and smiles) I really missed that feeling.
42505,Liv," Just k*ll me, Kai. You already k*ll my best friend. So just do it. Get it over with."
42506,Kai," Why can't I do this? I don't care about you. Why can't I k*ll you? Come on. Kai, do it. Do it. (slaps himself on the head repeatedly) Come onnnnn! k*ll her!"
42507,Liv, Motus!  (uses magic to throw a fork into Kai's chest)
42508,Kai, Ugh!  (falls to the ground)
42509,Damon, What the hell is happening?
42510,Elena, Liv is trying to k*ll Kai.
42511,Damon, (shouts) Jeremy! Jeremy!
42512,Jeremy, Send me back. (Kai wheezes; wounded) Please
42513,Kai," Jeremy, look at me. I'm half-dead."
42514,Jeremy, I need to stop Bonnie. Please.
42515,Kai," Ok. Ok. (begins) Phesmatos tribum invocio caveum, miscero mundio."
42516,Bonnie," Cheers to making it this far. (music playing; starts crying) Ok. Think it's time I cut myself off. Agh! (angrily throws the bottle to the floor, takes the video recorder and leaves the room)"
42517,Jeremy, Stay here.
42518,Caroline," Well, I think I got all the catharsis out of this that I'm gonna get. Let's go home."
42519,Stefan, All right. Wait a minute. What is that?
42520,Caroline, Shut up.
42521,Stefan," No, no, no. I'm serious. Is that an ear?"
42522,Caroline," Oh, my God. (digs up miss cuddles) Cuddles?! (laughs)"
42523,Stefan," I'm sure we can clean her up, make her as good as new."
42524,Caroline," Yeah. Oh, wait. (The bear's head rips off. They both start laughing.)"
42525,Stefan, Hey.
42526,Caroline, I'm sorry. (she hugs him and starts crying)
42527,Liv, (searches for Kai around the house) Kai! Get out here! (turns over a table)
42528,Damon, She's right below us.
42529,Liv, You can't hide from me!
42530,Elena, What are you doing?
42531,Damon," (Kicks the rubble and makes a hole down to the fireplace. Grabs the old bourbon) I said I was saving this for something special. (Drops the bottle down to the fireplace, which causes huge flames. Liv is then thrown backwards. Elena walks towards the door and finds out that the boundary spell is down.)"
42532,Jeremy," (Tries to touch her, but can't) No! Come on! You don't want to do this. Just turn off the car, Bon. You can't die."
42533,Bonnie," (starts recording) It's probably a waste of time even recording anything, but, Damon, Elena, whoever, you find this and you figure out how to work this stupid thing, please tell everyone that I'm sorry."
42534,Jeremy," Bonnie, no."
42535,Bonnie," Tell them that I tried. I really tried to make it work. Um... (She cries, causing Jeremy to as well) You know, I just miss too much. I miss saying hi to strangers... ordering dinner in a restaurant, laughing with my friends... But, um, spending every day here alone with no one to talk to, going weeks without speaking, it's just the loneliness. It's--I can't take it. And I only know one way to turn it off. I'm sorry."
42536,Jeremy," Come on, Bonnie. Get up! Come on."
42537,Bonnie, Gonna stay strong. I'm not gonna die in this place!
42538,Jeremy, Come on! Get up! (Tries to open the door)
42539,Bonnie, (gasps)
42540,Jeremy," Bonnie, get up! (repeatedly tries to open the door. Open! Come on! Bonnie falls to the ground coughing) Come on! (finally succeeds with opening the door)"
42541,Elena," Oh, Jeremy. Jeremy. Hey, Jeremy. Wake up."
42542,Damon," Kai, hey! Damn it! (gives Kai his bl*od)"
42543,Elena," Jeremy, wake up. Jer, wake up. (He opens his eyes) Oh! Jeremy."
42544,Jeremy, I'm OK.
42545,Elena," (worried) Bonnie, I-is she..."
42546,Jeremy, I saw her. Sh-she's gonna be OK. (She smiles and looks at Damon)
42547,Elena, I might be able to salvage a piece if you're interested.
42548,Jeremy," I don't think Bonnie would want us to let cake go to waste. (She takes up miss cuddles) You know, I get it. I get what she was going through, why she would want to end it, feeling trapped and alone. Every day is the same-- disappointment, misery. You go to sleep and wake up and do it all over again? But she's not the only one that's trapped."
42549,Elena," Jeremy, I know what you've been going through."
42550,Jeremy, Don't tell me I got to be strong.
42551,Elena," Actually, I was gonna say it's OK to move on. Bonnie decided to save herself, and from what you told me, I think she wants you to do the same. Go to art school. We'll all help you. Just...just find the life that you want (smiles) and be happy."
42552,Jeremy, What about you?
42553,Elena, I'll be fine. I promise. Just get out of here... And don't look back.
42554,Liv, (wakes up in her bed and sees Tyler) How did I get back here?
42555,Tyler," Well, first, I woke up on the floor. Guess a pillow would have been too much to ask for, and when I figured out where you'd gone, I raced over to the Salvatore house, only to find you unconscious. I convinced Elena to give you some of her bl*od... And now that I see you're OK, I never want to see you again."
42556,Liv," Tyler, wait!"
42557,Tyler, (angry) You lied to me.
42558,Liv, No! I never wanted to hurt you!
42559,Tyler, You lied to me!
42560,Liv, Please just calm down.
42561,Tyler," I'm not gonna calm down. I would have done anything for you, and you chose death over me."
42562,Enzo," So? How was your little coffee date? Heh. You fancy her, don't you?"
42563,Matt, What was the point of this?
42564,Enzo," You were a test. I wanted to see what kind of a person the last remaining Salvatore really is. What kind of person she is? Well, she spurned your comically inept attempts to charm her and yet proved to be a good Samaritan when you needed assistance. On a scale of 1-10, I'd say her purity ranks about...9.5. When I'm through with her, she'll be a one."
42565,Matt, So what--you're gonna compel her to be bad?
42566,Enzo, I'm not gonna compel her. I want Sarah to know that everything she did was of her own free will.
42567,Matt, (confused) What are you talking about?
42568,Enzo," I'm going to insinuate myself into her life, make her do things she'd never dream of doing until she begs me to make her a vampire. Heh. Stefan thought he could protect her. I'm gonna show him how wrong he is."
42569,Damon, So Jer's applying to art school. Hmm. (smiles to himself) Might want to compel him a decent portfolio because he ain't that great.
42570,Elena," Don't be mean. He needs to move on with his life, and... so do I."
42571,Damon, I'm not sure I'm a fan of that transition.
42572,Elena," Look. I've... made some huge mistakes in my life. Being with you wasn't one of them, and, yes, I had Alaric compel away my love for you, and, yes, I did love Stefan once. The night I died, Matt was driving me back to him, and yet I found my way back to you. Damon, I somehow always find my way back to you. It doesn't matter if I have memories or not. It doesn't matter if I'm a vampire or not."
42573,Damon, You're just saying that because you can't change what you are.
42574,Elena," No, Damon. I don't care what human me would have done because she's not here. I am. And if the past is a place without you and me together, then... Let's stop living in it."
42575,Damon, Yeah.
42576,Bonnie," Nova Scotia? (smiles) Damon, you're a genius."
42577,Elena, I know what you've been going through. Go to art school. Find the life that you want... and don't look back.
42578,Enzo," Meet the real Sarah Salvatore. Stefan set me up to die, which resulted in days of torture. That's when I started plotting my revenge. I'm going to make her do things she'd never dream of doing until she begs me to make her a vampire."
42579,Damon," I don't know if you remember this, but Liz and I are pretty close."
42580,Liz," I need you to promise me something. When I'm gone, Caroline is gonna need you to help her move on with her life. Promise me that you will do that, Stefan."
42581,Stefan,  (takes Liz's hand) I promise.
42582,Liz," Hey, Tony, I'm headed home for the night. Could you do me a favor and check up on the Lockwood place? Carol called again, another 5-Martini stalker sighting, oh, and some teenagers are planning a bonfire off route 13. No one's called to complain yet, but they will. See you."
42583,, Forbes.
42584,Liz, I'll be right there.
42585,Liz," Hey, what happened?"
42586,Police officer," Accident up at Wickery bridge. Driver lost control, careened off into the water."
42587,Liz, Any other casualties?
42588,Police officer,Two.
42589,Liz, Survivors?
42590,Police officer,One. We found her up on the bank unconscious. She must have crawled out of the car and passed out.
42591,Liz, Elena Gilbert. Where's her brother? Who are the casualties?
42592,Police officer,"Miranda and Grayson, her parents."
42593,Elena," Principal Weber, I know that graduation isn't for a few months, but Jeremy just got accepted into this great art school."
42594,Principal Weber," Jeremy Gilbert, I don't think so, not with his academic record."
42595,Elena, What's wrong with it?
42596,Principal Weber, You have a few hours? All right. Let's start with drug use in his freshman year.
42597,Damon, You mean the year that his parents died?
42598,Principal Weber, Ok. So what's the excuse for the next 3 years of woeful attendance?
42599,Damon," Extracurricular activities, health and fitness, that sort of thing. I mean, did you see how scrawny he used to be?"
42600,Principal Weber," No, but I do recall the 4 months where he faked his own death."
42601,Damon," Funny thing about that, he actually didn't fake it. We went to this island off the coast of Canada in search of this cure for vampirism, and Jeremy..."
42602,Elena, Damon!
42603,Principal Weber, Is this some sort of joke to you?
42604,Elena," No. Look. Jeremy has had a rough time here, I know, but that's part of the reason why we want him to go."
42605,Damon, Yeah.
42606,Principal Weber," Well, I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen."
42607,Damon, So can we try this my way now?
42608,Elena, We already compelled him into art school. Sorry that I wanted my little brother to actually get a degree.
42609,Damon," He will. He just won't earn it. Ok. Um... This small-town atmosphere doesn't nurture a creative spirit like Jeremy Gilbert, and it's of your opinion that it's high time for him to get the hell out of Mystic Falls."
42610,Jeremy," To Matt's phone, which is clearly more important than my last day in town."
42611,Matt," I'm here, aren't I? Where's Tyler?"
42612,Jeremy, He broke up with his girlfriend. He gets a free pass. Look. I want to take this sh*t before Alaric changes his mind about letting me drink.
42613,Alaric, This place is closed for another hour. I'm making an exception. Cheers.
42614,Jeremy, Cheers.
42615,Matt," To you, brother."
42616,Alaric," I swear, Jeremy, if I get a call from the drunk t*nk in Santa Fe..."
42617,Jeremy, You're gonna make your girlfriend give me an STD test again?
42618,Alaric," That cleared up, right?"
42619,Jeremy," Ha ha ha! (Cell phone vibrating) Why is Enzo still alive, and why is he calling you?"
42620,Matt," Nothing you need to worry about. (Beep) Hey, it's Jeremy's going-away party. Whatever you want, it can wait a day."
42621,Enzo (on phone)," Actually, it can't. Don't worry. I'm not sending you back to Duke. I brought Duke to you."
42622,Matt, What the hell does that...
42623,Enzo," I take it from your abrupt pause that you either had a small stroke or Sarah walked in. It's good news either way. Make her feel welcome, oh, and don't go blabbing details of our little arrangement around the party. Your tongue functions much better inside your mouth."
42624,Sarah, Matt. Hey.
42625,Matt, What are you doing here?
42626,Sarah," I got a call from the manager of this place. He needed someone to take pictures for the website, and he said you mentioned me. I mean, normally, the pictures I take are a little darker, but normally, I don't get paid, so thanks."
42627,Matt, You're welcome.
42628,Sarah, You want to show me around?
42629,Matt, Yeah. Yeah.
42630,Damon, Oh! Look who graduated.
42631,Jeremy, He was OK with it?
42632,Damon," Sure. I mean, practically flunking, missed 100 days of school, and you can barely spell the word ""cat,"" but sure. He was fine with you graduating early."
42633,Elena, We helped the process along.
42634,Jeremy, She ok?
42635,Damon," She will be. We all will. Somehow, we'll all find a way to move on without you, Jeremy."
42636,Caroline," If you really think about it, Jeremy leaving is for the best. I'm sure everything around him reminds him of Bonnie, and Elena's always wanted to protect him from vampire drama. Granted, he is going to art school, where the percentage rate for a well-paying job is one of the lowest in the country, but I really am happy for him."
42637,Stefan, Do you think you packed enough?
42638,Caroline," The whole point of this is for my mom to live out the rest of her time here in a relaxed and peaceful environment surrounded by the things that she loves, like photo albums and board games."
42639,Stefan," ""The anthology of Shakespeare,"" volumes one through 12."
42640,Caroline, All the books that she's never gotten around to reading.
42641,Stefan," Oh, hey, do you mind just... Do you mind getting that?"
42642,Caroline," Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Um, ok. Um... Just... Sorry."
42643,Stefan, Yeah. It's ok.
42644,Caroline, Got it. Um... Hmm. Why is my mom calling you? (Beep) Are you going behind my back for information?
42645,Liz," Well, hello, Stefan. What a lovely voice you have."
42646,Caroline, Why are you calling him?
42647,Liz," You snuck out of the house this morning witht so much as a hello. I may be a retired sheriff, but I am still a mother. What are you up to?"
42648,Caroline," If I told you, it would ruin the surprise. Master bedroom."
42649,Liz, At least tell me if Stefan is there voluntarily or against his will.
42650,Caroline, Neither. He's here because you asked him to look after me.
42651,Liz," Sweetheart, that's not true."
42652,Caroline," Mom, I heard you talking to him in hospital. You asked him to look after me and make me smile and help me move on with my life after you're gone."
42653,Liz, I'm sure that's not the only reason he's there.
42654,Caroline," Mom, look. It's ok. Needed an extra set of hands, anyway. I will call you in 3 hours with all the details. Until then, no cheating. I love you."
42655,Damon," Not to be blunt, but I think dying gets you a ticket out of work. Just saying. How you feeling?"
42656,Liz, Like I'm not gonna leave this job with unfinished business. I have all these open cases.
42657,Damon," Well, let me see if I can help you close a couple of them. Uhh! Yeah. This one was me. Me. Also me. Ooh, this one was Stefan's. Oh, wait. No. Me. Yeah."
42658,Liz, I always had a sneaking suspicion. What about this one?
42659,Damon, Elena's parents. Didn't know there was an open investigation.
42660,Liz," Well, at the time, I was taking care of Elena and Jeremy, and I didn't want to drag them through more heartache. Then when I was finally ready to reopen the wound, Elena had moved on, and you and I had become friends, and I worried that..."
42661,Damon," What, that I was involved? Liz, no. No, I promise you."
42662,Liz," Miranda left me this message two hours before they got in that car, two hours before they drove off that road for no reason."
42663,Miranda (on voicemail)," Liz, it's Miranda Gilbert. I have something urgent to talk to you about. Please call me back as soon as you can."
42664,Damon," I'll be damned. (Beep) Looks like you got a good, old-fashioned, sheriffy whodunit on your hands."
42665,Elena," You know I'm a vampire, right, a big sister with nearly perfect senses who can sneak up on you without making a sound."
42666,Elena, Our lives are so weird.
42667,Jeremy, That's the understatement of the century.
42668,Damon, Right.
42669,"Damon, on phone", I want to run something by you.
42670,Enzo, What is that strange smell?
42671,"Enzo, on phone"," Oh, this will come as a shock to you, but I don't care."
42672,"Enzo, on phone", I'm here. You don't see me?
42673,Stefan," So, I realize it doesn't matter."
42674,Caroline, What doesn't matter?
42675,Stefan, It doesn't matter what book your mom reads in her final precious moments. It doesn't matter if it's good or if it's terrible. It doesn't matter because life isn't about your final moments. It's about the moments that led up to them. 
42676,Caroline, Then why are you here?
42677,Stefan," Well, because you're my friend, because I know what it feels like to lose a mother, and because when you told me you hated me, that was pretty much the worst thing I had heard in a long time."
42678,Caroline, I think we both know I never really hated you.
42679,Enzo, Are you ok? What happened? Do you need help?
42680,Enzo," You staying calm, luv?"
42681,Elena, There you are.
42682,Damon, That makes sense.
42683,Jeremy," I can't leave now, no way, not with the sheriff sick and Enzo on a rampage. It's not the right time."
42684,Elena," No kidding, because the right time was a couple of years ago.Enzo could have k*ll you today, and the other day, Liv threw you across a room, and let's not forget the time that you actually died."
42685,Alaric, She's right. Time to get the hell out of here.
42686,Elena," You deserve a normal life, Jer. You deserve the life of a kid whose only baggage is that he lost his parents."
42687,Damon, Ok. Get in there.
42688,Liz," I did everything right, Damon. I lived a good life. I took care of my family. I just..."
42689,Damon, I know. Sometimes really terrible things happen to amazing people.
42690,Liz," I have to admit, there is a certain amount of peace knowing I'll be one of the only people in Mystic Falls to die an ordinary death. (Both chuckle) I'm exceptionally ordinary. I'm ok with that. Caroline is anything but. She was meant to be extraordinary, and she needs to know how proud I am of her."
42691,Damon, They said they can make her comfortable.
42692,Caroline," I'm her daughter, Stefan, OK? I was supposed to give her peace and convince her that I would be OK and thank her for being an amazing mom. God, I don't ever remember the last thing that I said to her. I was supposed to be with her in her final moment."
42693,Alaric," Granted, being a vampire hunter doesn't lend itself to a healthy social life."
42694,Jeremy," Yeah, turns out a social life isn't as much fun as kicking vampire ass."
42695,Caroline, I want to stop.
42696,Liz," If you stop, you'll never learn, sweetie."
42697,Liz, Keep pedaling. You can do it.
42698,Mr. Parker," Luke is gone. He merged with Kai, Kai won."
42699,Kai, I always win.
42700,Tyler," I would have done anything for you, and you chose death over me. I never want to see you again."
42701,Damon, Bonnie needs magic to get out. We just need to tell her where to find some.
42702,Bonnie," Damon, you're a genius."
42703,Stefan, Caroline's mom isn't doing too hot.
42704,Liz," Caroline is meant to be extraordinary, and she needs to know how proud I am of her."
42705,Stefan, When you told me you hated me.
42706,Caroline, I think we both know I never really hated you.
42707,Liz," OK. I've got band-aids, surgical gear, and a medevac enroute for an airlift."
42708,Caroline, You're making fun of me.
42709,Liz," No, sweetheart. I'm making fun of me. There is no greater first than watching your kid ride without training wheels... (tends to the graze) Oh, boy... and no worst first than seeing them bite the dust. All right. There."
42710,Caroline, Mommy?
42711,Liz, Yes.
42712,Caroline, Am I gonna die?
42713,Liz, I would say your chances of survival are 100%.
42714,Caroline, Are you gonna die?
42715,Liz," Well... everyone dies eventually, sweetie, but not for a long, long time."
42716,Caroline, But what if you die and I'm still here?
42717,Liz," Well, then you'll be all grown up, and you won't need me."
42718,Caroline, I think I'll always need you.
42719,Caroline," Sorry. Just, um, water."
42720,Damon, Help yourself.
42721,Caroline, (walks over to the sink) So what are you not writing?
42722,Damon, You believe your mother entrusted me to eulogize her?
42723,Caroline," That's... nice, I guess. (fills a glass with water)"
42724,Damon," I think she's trying to teach me a lesson about my own mom. Was supposed to do the eulogy at her funeral, and I just..."
42725,Caroline, We don't have to share.
42726,Damon, Right.
42727,Caroline, I just mean today is pretty much gonna be the worst day of my life. I'm not sure that I need to start it off by bonding with you. No offense.
42728,Damon, None taken.
42729,Caroline, Great. Thanks for the water. (starts to walk out of the kitchen)
42730,Damon," Hey, blondie. Today isn't the worst day of your life. Today and tomorrow, it's a cakewalk. And there will be people day in and day out like they're afraid to leave you alone. The worst day? That's next week when there's nothing but quiet. Just a heads-up."
42731,Caroline, Appreciate the tip. (walks out)
42732,Damon, Sure. Anytime.
42733,Caroline (V.O.), You've all asked what you can do to help.
42734,Caroline, There are five day's worth of projects on here. We are going to do them in one. We can break the rules and cut through the red tape. I expect my mom to be properly celebrated and buried by the end of the day.
42735,Matt," Sure, Care. Whatever you need."
42736,Caroline," Elena, you're coming with me."
42737,Elena, Where are we going?
42738,Caroline, Casket shopping. Let's move!
42739,Elena, You drive. I sent my car to Jeremy.
42740,Caroline, Jeremy! I forgot to put him on my list of people to call.
42741,Elena, It's okay. I called him.
42742,Bonnie," It's day 278 inside this stupid prison world. I have two broken toes, nine blisters, and an ear infection, but I don't care. I have phesmatosed the crap out of this magic Canadian rock, and I have my magic again. (Getting a drink of bourbon) And when that eclipse hits 12:28, I'm going home. You hear that, me? Home. (Drinks)"
42743,Alaric," Uh, you sure you don't want me to hold your hair back or something?"
42744,Jo, Stay away form me. This is gross. We haven't been dating long enough for you to see gross.
42745,Alaric, I have guilt. The vegan dish I made fun of did you in.
42746,Jo, I'm dying. Stupid Thai food. Never again. (Throws up)
42747,Alaric," You know, maybe would just skip the funeral."
42748,Jo, We're going.
42749,Kai," Hey. (Alaric tries to shut the door) Wait, wait, wait, wait. (Alaric opens the door) Look. I know you hate me, but I really... really need to see my sister."
42750,Alaric, I think she'll pass.
42751,Jo, What are you doing here?
42752,Kai," I called to tell you I was sick, and you... you hung up on me."
42753,Jo, Because I have food poisoning. Did the sound of me vomiting on the other end of line not clue you in?
42754,Kai," Look. There's an issue I've been worried about since the merge because we really didn't do it right. You know, the whole , ""You're not my twin"" ""Hey. That's okay. Close enough"" plan? It worked, which is, you know, cool. Hey, I'm even a little bit nice now in case you were wondering. But I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop. And, well, I think it's dropped because I'm... Where's the bathroom? (Kai starts vomiting bl*od)"
42755,Jo," Oh, God! Ric!"
42756,Alaric, (Gives Kai something to vomit into) Here.
42757,Kai," I don't think you have food poisoning. I was supposed to merge my magic with you. But I got Luke's instead. Ohh. Now I'm defective, and I think that's why you're sick. I kind of feel like I'm dying, actually. And if I die, so do you, dad, Liv, and the rest of our dumb coven. So could you please fix me, like, now?"
42758,Damon, What are you doing?
42759,Stefan, Borrowing one of father's ties for the funeral.
42760,Damon, He will skin you alive. Take mine. (Takes off his tie and kneels down to put it on Stefan) Okay.
42761,Stefan, Did you finish the speech?
42762,Damon, Not quite.
42763,Stefan, It's an important speech.
42764,Damon," I will finish it, Stefan."
42765,Stefan, Father said we're not to cry.
42766,Damon, That is because father is incapable of human emotion. You are ten. You can cry if you feel like it.
42767,Stefan, (Shakes his head) I don't think I will.
42768,Damon, Why's that?
42769,Stefan, Because mother's angel told me everything would be alright.
42770,Damon, When was this?
42771,Stefan, Last night in my sleep. She visited me. Did she visit you?
42772,Damon," I must have missed it. There. Be on your way. (Pats Stefan on the head, who leaves the room.)"
42773,Stefan," Well, I see the eulogy is coming along swimmingly."
42774,Damon, It's percolating.
42775,Stefan," Listen. I need your advice, and I need you to not be a dick about it because I have no one else to ask."
42776,Damon," Oh, this sounds promising."
42777,Stefan," What did I just say? (Damon gestures for Stefan to continue) All right, look. Something happened between Caroline and me."
42778,Damon, Ooh! Finally!
42779,Stefan," And then her mom died, and I haven't had a chance to talk to her about it, and I don't know the best way to handle it."
42780,Damon, Oh. Pull the ripcord.
42781,Stefan, What?
42782,Damon," Well, she's not the one. If she was, you wouldn't have to ask."
42783,Stefan," Yeah, but I didn't even-"
42784,Damon," You've been in love twice in your life, Stefan. Setting aside that it was technically the same face, does this feel like that? (Stefan doesn't answer) Not all love is true love, brother. Caroline wants the real deal, and if you don't, pull the ripcord before you make things worse. Just not today. Let her have today."
42785,Ms. McGruder, Your mother was such a vibrant woman. Even after your father ran off with that man.
42786,Elena," (rushes in) Thank you, Ms. McGruder. I'm sure we'll see you at the funeral. (quickly leads Caroline away.) Well, welcome to the world of awkward sympathies. That's why you have to be prepared with your responses. I recommend at least three."
42787,Caroline, I don't know how you survived this.
42788,Elena," Your responses will be different for each category of people in your life: friends of circumstance, casual acquaintances, loved ones."
42789,Caroline," I kissed Stefan. I want to talk to him about it, but if it's bad, I feel like he won't be honest, you know, not today."
42790,Elena, Then talk to him about it tomorrow. You already have a lot on your plate.
42791,Caroline, I think I need to know today. We're behind schedule. Let's go.
42792,Jo, Any joint pain?
42793,Kai, Mm-hmm.
42794,Jo, Headaches?
42795,Kai, Yup.
42796,Jo, Are you pregnant?
42797,Kai, Stop making jokes. I feel like I'm being scrunched from inside out. This is kinda private. Does your baby-boo need to be here?
42798,Alaric," I'm not leaving her alone with you, so deal with it."
42799,Jo," Okay. Your vitals are fine, your temperature is normal. I'll wait on pathology, but there is nothing medically wrong with you."
42800,Kai," Yeah, duh, because I'm magically diseased. You haven't puked in at least..."
42801,Jo, (Realizes Kai is about to vomit bl*od) Oh!
42802,Alaric," Hey, hey! (pulls Kai off of Jo)"
42803,Kai, Oh. I feel better.
42804,Jo, Yeah because you juice-boxed my magic.
42805,Kai," Yeah, sorry about that. That was an accident, but I... Wow! I legitimately feel better. You need to give me your magic."
42806,Jo, What?
42807,Kai," This faux merge is clearly failing because I was supposed to get your magic, right? (Kai gets up toward Jo, but Alaric stands in front of him) Just - I don't know - put it in a teddy bear or a bed pan and gimmie. (reaches out his hand)"
42808,Alaric," (Grabs Kai's hand) Listen. I could just as easily break seven little bones with one good squeeze, okay?"
42809,Kai," I can see you're skeptical, Ric. Can I call you Ric? Hey, buddy, but here's the thing you need to know is that Jo only survives if I do, okay? And if that's not enough for you, the power that binds the prison worlds comes form the leader of the gemini coven. If I die, the worlds collapse, alright? I see vacancy. Would you like me to start over with single syllables?"
42810,Alaric," Did you say prison worlds, as in more than one?"
42811,Kai, Has no one ever mentioned that?
42812,Bonnie, This is it. I'm ready. There's no one to stop me. I have magic and the ascendant and the eclipse.
42813,Bonnie, No. No!
42814,Elena, I'm worried about Caroline. I don't think she's handling this as well as she thinks she is. (sees Damon still writing the eulogy) You're not done yet?
42815,Damon," No, I'm not done, and I will never be done. I am not a nice person and should not have to stand in front of the whole town and pretend to be a nice person. This is Liz having a last laugh from the great beyond."
42816,Elena, Hey. Easy. You are nice... ish.
42817,Damon, Not helping.
42818,Elena," This isn't about you, Damon. This isn't even about Liz. It's about Caroline and what she needs to hear. Okay? (kisses Damon on the cheek and leaves the room)"
42819,Stefan, You missed your speech.
42820,Damon, I know.
42821,Stefan, Why?
42822,Damon, I did not know what to say.
42823,Stefan, (crying) You could have just said goodbye.
42824,Jo, I really don't have a choice.
42825,Alaric, Of course you have a choice. It's your magic to give or not give.
42826,Jo, What do you think I should do?
42827,Alaric," Look, my life is full of martyrs who cave to the bad guy, trying to be heroes, and it never ends well. Somebody inevitably gets hurt or dead, and that somebody could just as easily be you, or Bonnie regardless, no matter what you do. So, if you wanna fight adn keep your magic, I will fight with you. And if not, well... I loved you when you weren't a witch, and I'm pretty sure I will still love you regardless."
42828,Jo, Pretty sure?
42829,Alaric," Yeah, at least 92%."
42830,Stefan, Caroline? Doing alright?
42831,Caroline, Yeah. Fine. All things... considered.
42832,Stefan, (walks over) Sure you're doing okay?
42833,Caroline," Mm-hmm. Yeah. No. I don't know. Just now, I was supposed to put you into a category so I would know what to say to you, but then I realized I didn't know what category you would want to be put in. So, uh, I was thinking, ""I guess there's no time like the horribly inappropriate present to get to the bottom of that."" (pause) I could list the categories if you like."
42834,Stefan," Caroline, I, um... I-I want to talk to you about all this. I do, but, maybe when we're alone and you've had a chance to get through the day."
42835,Caroline," Yeah. God, of course. Um, this is not the time. I'm so sorry."
42836,Stefan," Hey, hey. (hugs Caroline) Don't be sorry. (lets her go) We'll talk when all this is over. (leaves the room)"
42837,Elena, Care. They're ready. Do you need a minute?
42838,Caroline," No, I'm okay. (looks at her mom's body) I'm gonna be alright, mom. I promise. Everything will be fine after today. (looks up) I'm ready."
42839,Bonnie," Okay. Clearly, I've been dropped into a snowy tundra hell dimension. Either that or I finally had a psychotic break."
42840,Bonnie, Incendia!
42841,Matt, There you are. You're late.
42842,Tyler," (putting on his jacket) Yeah. Liv used to say she hated all my ties, so I had to find a new one. (slips down the stairs)"
42843,Matt, Are you drunk?
42844,Tyler, That depends. How many days in a row can someone drink before they're just normal?
42845,Matt, You're not going in there.
42846,Tyler," Back off, man. It's Caroline's mom. I'm not missing her funeral."
42847,Matt," I'm sorry about you and LIv. I know you've been going through a lot of crap, but Caroline does not deserve you bringing it here."
42848,Pastor," We are here today to pay our tribute and our respect to a pillar of our community, our sister, our protector, Sheriff Elizabeth Forbes. We are also here today to show our love and support for Liz's family and friends."
42849,Officer," Calling Sheriff Forbes. This is the last call for Sheriff Forbes. (Matt leans forward as if getting an idea) No response. Radio Number 2-6 is out of service after twelve years and four months of police service. Gone, but never forgotten. Center!"
42850,Damon," Liz Forbes was my friend. In her last moments, she asked me to pass along a message to her daughter, but I cut her off before she could say too much. I told her she could tell Caroline herself, but she didn't get that chance. Your mom wanted you to know how proud of you she was, and she should be. You're a beautiful, strong woman, a generous friend, and a bright light in a sea of dark. She said you were extraordinary, and you are, and so was she. Liz was a hero to this town. She was a hero to all of you. And she was a hero to me. Goodbye, Sheriff. You will be missed."
42851,Caroline, Thank you all for coming. This is for my mom. ♪Go in peace. Go in kindness. Go in love. Go in faith. Leave the day. The day behind us. The day is done. Go in grace. Let us go into the dark. Not afraid. Not alone. Let us hope by some good pleasure. Safely to. Arrive at home.♪
42852,Tyler, I'm sober. Don't ask me to leave.
42853,Matt," I'm not. I'm glad you pulled it together. The thing is, Ty, I get it, alright? We've all been through so much that it's bound to make us a little crazy. But I was thinking, you know, watching the way all those cops honored her today, I want to be a part of something like that. So I talked to one of the deputies, and he gave me an application. There's this, uh, officer training program. Seems pretty cool, you know, like something I'm supposed to be a part of. I got one for you too."
42854,Elena," Hey, are you leaving?"
42855,Caroline, Yeah. I think I've done the whole funeral thing enough for one day.
42856,Elena, I'll walk you home.
42857,Caroline," No, it's two blocks. I'll be fine, Elena."
42858,Elena," I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be alone tonight, you know?"
42859,Caroline," I think that's exactly what I need actually. (hugs Elena) Thank you for everything you did today, Elena. I'll never forget it."
42860,Elena, You're welcome. But-
42861,Caroline," I'll be fine, Elena. Okay? I just had to get through today."
42862,Bonnie," Oh, my God."
42863,Jo, Let's do this.
42864,Kai," Ahh. Me, our coven, and the prison worlds thank you."
42865,Alaric, What exactly is this other prison world?
42866,Kai," A place filled with crappy people like me, I'm sure. (to Jo) Congrats. You're saving their miserable lives from Oblivion. (pinching Jo's cheeks) Oh, don't look so stressed. (Jo shakes him off) You never liked being a witch anyway."
42867,Jo, Shut up. (Jo places her hands on Kai's cheeks) Oribos turai manecsitus. Orbiem. Oribos turai-
42868,(The house starts shaking and Bonnie runs out and finds herself back in the woods in the 1994 Prison World. Bonnie sees the eclipse and checks her watch; it is nearly 12,28.)
42869,Bonnie," Oh, God. (runs for the hole)"
42870,Jo, Oribos turai manecsitus. Orbiem
42871,Bonnie," I can do this. The Northern Lights, the eclipse, they're both recurring events. (checks her watch) I can get out of here. (cuts her hand on the ascendant) Come on, come on. Sangina mearma, ascendarum cavea. Sangina mearma, ascendarum cavea. Sangina mearma, ascendarum cavea. Sangina mearma-"
42872,Woman, Who are you?
42873,Bonnie, Who are you?
42874,Jo, It's done.
42875,Kai, Ahh. Thank you. And congratulations.
42876,Kai," Have a good life, Sissie."
42877,Alaric, What'd he say?
42878,Jo," The reason I was sick, it wasn't food poisoning."
42879,Alaric, What was it?
42880,Jo, He said that I'm pregnant. I don't know what to say. I don't hmm... I don't know what to do with that.
42881,Alaric, Marry me.
42882,Jo," What?! No, no. That's a pity proposal. You can't throw a pity proposal at a pregnant ex-witch. I don't even know if I want kids, let alone get married. (Alaric takes a ring box out of his pocket) Oh, my God. What are you doing?"
42883,Alaric," I bought this the day after your brother died. Caroline's mother was sick and you were in danger. And I just thought life's too short. And I've been trying to plan for the right moment, which was supposed to be this morning with breakfast in bed, you know, until you started puking up last night's dinner."
42884,Jo, Ric.
42885,Alaric," We can talk about choices and all that. We can. But I would really love to have this baby with you. That's, uh, something I never thought I'd have. So this isn't a pity proposal, Jo. I love you. (Alaric kneels down and opens the box to reveal a diamond ring.) Marry me."
42886,Jo, (sits down) I can't believe this. Are you sure?
42887,Alaric, At least 92%.
42888,Jo, Yes. Yes. Yes. (Alaric and Jo smile and hug.)
42889,Stefan, Nice speech.
42890,Damon, Thanks.
42891,Stefan, What broke through the writer's block?
42892,Damon, I just needed to be reminded that the goodbye wasn't about me. I failed you by not doing the eulogy at our mother's funeral. (Stefan gives Damon a surprised look.) I didn't want to fail anyone today.
42893,Stefan," I think you were wrong about Caroline. I realized that I may not be able to explain what I feel for her, but it is something. And yeah, maybe all love isn't true love in the messed up way that you and I have experienced it but, I think this could turn into something even better."
42894,Damon," Well then, brother, stop wasting your time sitting here with me. I think she could use a piece of news like that today."
42895,Caroline," I said I was fine, Elena."
42896,Elena," I don't believe you. (Caroline turns around.) All day, something has been bugging me. You wanted to pack this all in so quickly like you had somewhere you needed to be. I mean, you were so concerned with getting through today without a hint of how you'd feel tomorrow. And then I realized. You don't want to feel tomorrow. That's the plan, right? You're not going to feel tomorrow because you're going t turn it all off."
42897,Caroline," I thought I could get through the rough patch and just pick myself up after like I usually do, but then Damon made me realize it's just going to get worse."
42898,Elena, You listened to Damon?
42899,Caroline," I can't do worse, Elena, okay? I didn't even think there was a worse. It's better this way."
42900,Elena," Better? Care, you're talking about flipping the humanity switch. There's nothing better about that."
42901,Caroline," That is your experience, okay? I have more control over my vampire side than you ever did. My experience will be different."
42902,Elena," It's not gonna be different, Care. It's gonna be deadly. You saw what happened to me when I did it."
42903,Caroline," Yeah, that's my point, Elena. You did it. You couldn't handle the pain when your brother died, so you turned it off. Damon died, and you erased all your memories. Stefan moved to Savannah and became an auto mechanic. What, do you think that you guys are the only ones who get to escape grief?"
42904,Elena, You just mentioned two of the biggest mistakes that I ever made.
42905,Caroline," Were they mistakes? Because when you came out the other end, the worst part of the pain was gone, and that's what I need. I just need the pain to be gone."
42906,Elena," And if Stefan had said the right thing earlier, would that have changed your mind? (Caroline looks shocked.) Yeah. I heard."
42907,Caroline," Well, he didn't, so it really doesn't matter. (starts to cry) My mom is dead, Elena. I-It hurts so bad, I can't breathe. I can't-I can't do worse. I can't, okay? I shouldn't have to."
42908,Elena," No one should have to. It's not fair. It's not. I get it. I do. (Elena hugs Caroline.) And I know you think that you have it all figured out, but please listen to me. I'm not gonna let you do this."
42909,Caroline, (emotionless) That's not your choice to make.
42910,Damon," (leaving a voicemail) Where'd you go, Elena? Call me back."
42911,Damon, Bonnie?
42912,Bonnie, One and only.
42913,Damon," Oh, you made it!"
42914,Stefan," Caroline? Sorry to barge in. Door was unlocked. (He walks in and finds Elena's unconscious body. Stefan runs over to her, but Caroline is nowhere to be found.) Caroline! Caroline!"
42915,Damon, I don't get it. So you were in my house in a 1903 prison world.
42916,Bonnie, (takes out the video camera) Watch this. I didn't know it was still on when I got pulled out.
42917,Damon, Congratulations. You sh*t some walls.
42918,Bonnie, Just wait.
42919,Woman, (on camera) Who are you?
42920,Bonnie, (on camera) Who are you?
42921,Damon, Who is this?
42922,Bonnie, There. Stop. (pauses to get a clear view of the woman)
42923,Damon," Oh, my God."
42924,Bonnie, What?
42925,Damon, It's my mother.
42926,Woman, Who are you?
42927,Bonnie, Who are you?
42928,Damon," Ha ha ha! Oh, you made it!"
42929,Bonnie, There. Stop.
42930,Damon," Oh, my God. That's my mother."
42931,Kai," This merge happened with my brother Luke, and I won, so when I absorbed Luke's magic, I must have gotten some of his qualities like empathy."
42932,Caroline," I think we both know I never really hated you. I kissed Stefan. I want to talk to him about it, but if it's bad, I feel like he won't be honest."
42933,Stefan, We'll talk when all of this is over.
42934,Pastor, We are here today to pay our respect to sheriff Elizabeth Forbes.
42935,Elena, You're talking about flipping the humanity switch.
42936,Caroline, I just need the pain to be gone.
42937,Elena," If Stefan had said the right thing earlier, would that have changed your mind?"
42938,Caroline," My mom is dead, Elena."
42939,Elena, I'm not gonna let you do this.
42940,Caroline, (emotionless) That's not your choice to make.
42941,Caroline," Hello! I'm empty. Fill, please."
42942,Bartender, I think you've had enough.
42943,Caroline, Look at my face. This is me straining to care less about what you think.
42944,Caroline, Nope. I can't.
42945,Bartender, Ok. I'm gonna call you a cab.
42946,Caroline," Here's the thing. My mom just died as in I just put her dead, cancer-riddled body into the ground 4 hours and 32 minutes ago."
42947,Bartender, I'm so sorry for your loss.
42948,Caroline," Oh, no, no, no. I don't care about that. I'm just saying that my feet have been crammed in the world's most uncomfortable heels for an entire day, and your tequila is the only thing that seems to be helping."
42949,Bartender, Ok. I'll grab you another drink.
42950,Caroline, Thank you.
42951,Liam," Caroline Forbes, the girl from the swimming hole."
42952,Caroline, Liam. Ha. The boy I totally forgot existed.
42953,Liam, Ouch. And I was just about to tell you how sexy you looked.
42954,Caroline, Heh. You are drunk.
42955,Liam, Slightly buzzed. Getting my ass whupped in shuffleboard upstairs.
42956,Caroline," Oh, lucky you. I stood all day at my mom's funeral. God, you're cute. Are you a doctor yet?"
42957,Liam, Hang on. Your mom just died?
42958,Caroline, Do you want to get out of here?
42959,Liam, I...
42960,Caroline, What? Girlfriend? We all know you're not dating Elena Gilbert.
42961,Liam, Why would I be dating Elena?
42962,Caroline," You wouldn't, but even if you were, it wouldn't matter because nothing matters, not... a... thing."
42963,Liam, Caroline! Aah!
42964,Elena," It's like she never lived here. (she opens and closes several drawers, all of which are empty) How's her house?"
42965,Stefan, (he comes down the stairs of an empty house) Totally empty. Caroline took everything but the damn doors off the hinges.
42966,Elena," So what? She just flipped her humanity switch, came back to the dorm, and took all of her clothes (she opens her desk drawer) and thank you notes (she slams it closed) and just left town? I mean, that makes no sense."
42967,Stefan, This is coming from the girl that b*rned her house down.
42968,Elena, Do you think she's trying to cut off all ties to her past?
42969,Stefan," (agitated) I certainly don't think she's having a yard sale, Elena."
42970,Elena, Ok. Why are you getting mad at me? I'm not the one who did this.
42971,Stefan, (Exhales) I know. I'm sorry.
42972,Elena," OK. Look. I'm just gonna look around campus, maybe someone's seen her but just let me know if you find anything, OK?"
42973,Stefan, Alright. I will. (they hang up)
42974,Bonnie," Looks like you could use a friend. (Elena turns at the sound of her voice, stunned)"
42975,Elena," Oh, my god. Bonnie? (Bonnie smiles and laughs) H-how are you..."
42976,Bonnie, (Walking through the doorway) Alive? (She shrugs) I think I'd be used to this part by now.
42977,Elena, Ohh! (She happily hugs Bonnie)
42978,Kai," I can't believe Bonnie made it out. Actually, I can. She's plucky. Hey, do you need help? Oh. Before you answer that, I'd rather not. (Kai walks toward him) I just keep experiencing these pangs of guilt watching you.  Feelings are hard."
42979,Damon, So's the end of this crowbar.
42980,Kai," (laughs) I'm just saying. Digging up mommy's grave? That's dark, even for me, and totally unnecessary. Damon, Bonnie saw her alive in a 1903 prison world. It's... it's on camera. You want to watch it again?"
42981,Damon, My mother died of Consumption in 1858. We did not go through the trouble of moving this thing to the family crypt only to find out that she's not even in here.
42982,Kai," Oh, so you just... You just called me here because you needed a friend? No. You wanted to know if it was possible for her to exist in another prison world. To which I responded, ""yes,"" to which you responded with denial."
42983,Damon," Whatever or whoever's on that tape, it's not her."
42984,Kai, Then who is it?
42985,Damon, I don't know. A ghost? Maybe she has an evil Gemini twin.
42986,Kai, (laughs) Nice.
42987,Damon," If my mother was imprisoned in 1903, she'd be in her 70s."
42988,Kai, Not if she were like you.
42989,Damon," (Turns around angry) I know my mother. She's not a vampire. She is not in a prison world. She died of Consumption in 1858. (He throws the crowbar, it clangs on the ground and he stares at the old coffin)"
42990,Kai," Uh, if you're so sure of that why haven't you opened the coffin yet? (Damon flips off the lid which smashes on the ground to reveal an empty coffin) Congratulations. Everything you know about your mom is wrong. (Kai pats him on the shoulder and leaves. Damon stares at the empty coffin.)"
42991,Enzo," (Standing behind her) In the future, (she jumps) focus on my left side. It's far more attractive."
42992,Sarah," (Turning to face him) Oh, my god."
42993,Enzo, We've met before.
42994,Sarah, Yes. You saved my friend Matt with your bl*od.
42995,Enzo," Oh, yes. Uh, Sarah, right? Care to join me for a cup of tea? My best angle's up close and personal. (Sarah motions for him to join her) Brave. I like that. (He says as he sits across from her)"
42996,Bonnie," My not flannel blouse, my not flannel T-shirts, and... ooh... ohh... I really missed my not flannel V-neck."
42997,Elena," Suck it, 1994 (She pops open the bottle of champagne which causes Bonnie to jump) Whew! Ha! So I bought this bottle of champagne (she pours two glasses) the same day that Damon and I thought we were gonna rescue you, but obviously, we didn't, so I couldn't drink it, so this is to you. (She makes a toast, which is actually really depressing) You were stuck there all by yourself while we were back here, living our lives. And this is the worst toast ever."
42998,Bonnie," I'm back home. That's all that matters. Cheers (they clink their glasses together and drink, Bonnie downs her glass quickly)."
42999,Elena, OK.
43000,Bonnie, Can we talk about the fact that I drove Jeremy away to art school? (Elena pours her another glass)
43001,Elena, So does that make you his muse? Because eww.
43002,Bonnie, Do me a favor. Don't tell him I'm back yet.
43003,Elena, Wait. You... you haven't called him yet?
43004,Bonnie," I just... I want to give him a chance at normalcy (she takes a seat on the bed) before we just drag him back into all of this, you know?"
43005,Elena," (Surprised) Yeah. No. I-I do, too, but, Bonnie, you should at least tell him you're OK."
43006,Bonnie," And I will. I'll tell him. Coming back to life is complicated. Trust me. I've done it before. Besides, we have a roommate without her humanity and in severe need of an intervention. (They turn as the door opens, Caroline walks in with several shopping bags)"
43007,Elena," Caroline. Um, you're here."
43008,Caroline, And you're perceptive. (She walks right past Bonnie without even a glance setting her bags on her bed) Ahh.
43009,Elena," Uh, what are you doing?"
43010,Caroline," Starting over. New everything! (taking the items out of her bags) New sheets, new clothes. Hey. I even got us a new blow-dryer. (she says turning to face them) Oh, my God! Bonnie's back. Hi. I thought you were trapped in 1994."
43011,Bonnie, I got out.
43012,Caroline," Huh. (she turns back to her bags, not carring in the least bit to see Bonnie)"
43013,Elena," Uh, we... we've been worried about you, Care."
43014,Caroline," You mean, you were worried about those around me, like if I k*ll them. OK. Funny story. You remember Liam? (to Bonnie) Oh. Elena dated this premed hottie but then realized she still had feelings for Damon, so she compelled him to forget that they ever had a thing."
43015,Elena," Caroline, what did you do to Liam?"
43016,Caroline," I ate him, (flash to the scene of Caroline biting Liam) and he was delicious. (Elena is shocked and angry, staring at her) I mean, you know how cute guys just naturally taste better?"
43017,Bonnie, You k*ll Elena's ex?
43018,Caroline," (Scoffs) OK. Can I just tell my story, please? (to Elena) Remind me why we're glad she's back again."
43019,Elena, Please tell me Liam is not dead.
43020,Caroline, Fine. So I was feeding...
43021,Caroline (V.O.)," .. and then that little voice inside my head that tells me to stop, he never piped up."
43022,Caroline," (To Liam) More, Please. (Liam collapses him Carolines' arms, she catches him) Whoa! (scoffs) Well, this is awkward. Ugh. God. (She leans him up against a wall; and catches a glimpse of her necklace which has bl*od on it) Oh. You got bl*od on my necklace! Now I'm gonna have to clean it."
43023,Liam, What are you doing to me?
43024,Caroline," Well, I was going to drain of your bl*od, but now I'm not really in the mood to drag your corpse through the woods, definitely not in these heels. I could throw you in a dumpster, but then everyone's always being found in dumpsters, and since I was the last person to be seen with you, I'll be questioned by the police, and what if one of them reminds me of my dead mother?"
43025,Liam, What are you talking about?
43026,Caroline," You, Liam, just got complicated. (she grins)"
43027,Elena, So you didn't k*ll him because it would be inconvenient?
43028,Caroline," Elena, I shut off my humanity. I didn't turn into an idiot. The last thing I want to do is give you a reason to ruin my life. (She drinks straight from the champagne bottle)"
43029,Bonnie," Huh. It's so weird. It's like she's Caroline, but she's not."
43030,Caroline," Oh, Bonnie, how we all just missed your commentary. Anyway, in return for my good behavior, I want a year where I don't have to feel pain or grief or remorse. You're not gonna lock me in a cell and dry me out, and you're definitely not gonna try to trigger some latent emotion, hoping to snap my humanity back on."
43031,Elena," So all you want is for us to leave you alone, and then you promise not to k*ll anyone?"
43032,Caroline," That's all I want. Now granted, if anyone tries anything to flip my switch back on — and I mean anything — (she says very seriously) I'll become your worst nightmare. (Elena and Bonnie exchange glances) Great! I'm gonna get a latte. (She grabs her purse) See you! (And walks past them, leaving them there very confused and shocked to her new behavior)."
43033,Damon, (Amused) So St. Caroline keeps her halo even with no humanity.
43034,Stefan," Yeah, until she snaps and strangles somebody with it."
43035,Damon," Well, even if she does... (Crash!) (Damon turns around to see Kai going through some antiques in the house) Could be good for her, you know, to blow off some steam, thin the herd. Getting awfully crowded around here."
43036,Stefan," Damon, if she k*ll somebody, I..."
43037,Damon," (interrupts) It's not your fault, Stefan. By the time you figured out how you felt about her, it was too late. She made her choice."
43038,Stefan," Just do me a favor. Check around Mystic Falls, see if anybody's missing."
43039,Damon," Will do, brother. (Damon hangs up) A little later. (He turns to see Kai pouring himself a drink)"
43040,Kai," Yeah. Why tell your brother your mother's still alive? No, but I get it. Mom's in a prison world and therefore an evil psychopath. Don't want to ruin little bro's perfect mommy memory."
43041,Damon, I'll tell him as soon as I know the truth.
43042,Kai, The truth.
43043,Damon, Which is why you're still here. Your sister sent me and Elena back to 1994. You can send me back to 1903.
43044,Kai," Technically, yes, I am able to do that, but I'll need the ascendant for the 1903 prison world."
43045,Damon," Oh. As the newly elected President of the Gemini freaks, I assume you know where to get it. (Kai shrugs) So get it."
43046,Kai, It's my pleasure. (He sips his drink loudly and stares up at Damon)
43047,Damon, (Rolling his eyes knowingly) You want something. (Damon sits down across from him) Shocker. (He replies sarcastically) All right.
43048,Kai," (Leaning forward) Well, ever since you told me Bonnie was back, I, uh, I can't stop thinking about her, all right, what I did, how she is. It's annoying really. (He exhales) Look. I need to see her. I need to apologize, and you're gonna make that happen."
43049,Sarah, So that's it? Enzo? That's all I get?
43050,Enzo," A name is a very personal thing, Sarah. See? Doesn't that feel good?"
43051,Sarah," I have pictures of you, your veins doing weird, nonhuman things. (Enzo chuckles as Sarah holds up her memory card to prove it) They're all on this little card."
43052,Enzo, You went from cowering in a corner to overt blackmail in the span of an hour. Impressive.
43053,Enzo," Fair enough. (He leans forward, setting his tea on the table) One... (At vampire speed he grabs the memory card from her hand) I'm very fast. Two, (He breaks the memory card in half) I'm very strong."
43054,Sarah," (She throws up her hands, annoyed) That was, like, 70 bucks."
43055,Enzo," 3, I'm very rich."
43056,Sarah," (Setting down her camera) Rich, strong, fast, you have weird veins, you can heal people with your bl*od. What are you?"
43057,Enzo," (Scoffs) This is a joke, right?"
43058,Sarah, Does it look like I'm joking?
43059,Enzo, Oh. You want to hear me say it. Fine. I'm a vampire.
43060,Sarah, (Not the least bit phased by his words) And?
43061,Enzo," Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said I'm a vampire. You know, Anne Rice, Dracula, that dreadful ""Twilight"" series."
43062,Sarah, No. No. I know what they are. I just thought there'd be more to it.
43063,Caroline," (Walking over, interrupting their conversation) It's OK. The whole vampire thing is over anyway."
43064,Enzo, Caroline.
43065,Caroline," Who is this nice girl we're divulging all of our deepest, darkest secrets to?"
43066,Sarah, I'm Sarah.
43067,Caroline, Sarah. Photographer Sarah. Stefan's...
43068,Enzo, (interrupts) (to Sarah) Darling... (She turns toward him and he compels her) You need a drink from the bar. (Sarah gets up and walks away. Enzo watches her leave then turns his attention to Caroline)
43069,Caroline, It is so nice not to care what you're up to with that poor girl. (She laughs) Old me would have been in such a moral quandary right now.
43070,Enzo," (scoffs) Old you? (Caroline grins and realization hits Enzo, he rollls his eyes) Oh, you didn't."
43071,Caroline, (happily) I did right after my mom's funeral. Thanks for coming by the way. Kidding! I don't really care about that either.
43072,Enzo," You're a laugh riot, aren't you?"
43073,Caroline," I'm actually a little bored, which is why I'm recruiting cute boys to come to Whitmore's warehouse party tonight. You like to dance, right?"
43074,Enzo," Yeah, I love it."
43075,Caroline," See you there. (She walks past him, Enzo turns and watches her leave)."
43076,Liam," Stefan. Hey, man."
43077,Stefan," Hey. I'm gonna ask you a couple questions, and I need you to be completely honest with me."
43078,Liam, (Compelled) I can be completely honest with you.
43079,Stefan, Good. (Stefan leads him into a room and closes the door behind them) Do you remember being around Caroline last night?
43080,Liam," Uh, (He grins and laughs) heh. Yeah. Kind of hard to forget."
43081,Stefan, What is that supposed to mean?
43082,Liam, We made out pretty hardcore.
43083,Stefan, Was there any biting involved?
43084,Liam," Uh... I guess. I mean, I-I like to bite the lower lip a little bit, (He replies uncomfortably) but I-I th... I think it's kind of weird you're asking me these questions."
43085,Stefan," No. I meant, did she bite you?"
43086,Liam," Not that I remember. Are... are you into her or something? (Stefan sighs) Because, like, I thought she was single. I didn't know you two were, like, a..."
43087,Stefan, She is. We're not.
43088,Liam," Great! Can I get out of here, please, because, like, I'm late for this party, and you're really weirding me out."
43089,Stefan, What party?
43090,Liam," Uh, warehouse party off campus. Caroline will be there if you want to watch. (He grins and pats Stefan on the shoulder. Stefan rolls his eyes as Liam leaves)"
43091,Elena," Hey, Stefan."
43092,Stefan," Hey. Uh, listen. I never thought I would ask this, but, um... Do you want to go to a rave?"
43093,Elena, OK. Not exactly the welcome home party I was planning for you. I think we should split up and look for Caroline. (She yells over the noise)
43094,Bonnie, (Unable to hear her) Maybe we should split up and look for Caroline. (She yells back over the noise)
43095,Elena, (Grins) Good idea. (she mouths the words) Good luck. (Elena turns and makes her way through the crowd)
43096,Caroline, (Whispers to Elena) I'm fine. (She winks and goes back to dancing)
43097,Guy, Want to dance? (He asks handing her a blue glowstick)
43098,Bonnie," I'm actually looking for someone. (She says, putting the glowstick in his shirt pocket)"
43099,Guy, This is a party. Have fun! (He takes her by the hand and pulls her toward the dance floor; he dances but Bonnie just stands there not in the mood; the guys reaches out toward Bonnie but she stops him)
43100,Bonnie," Hey. Down, boy."
43101,Guy, Just dancing.
43102,Bonnie, Look. I really have to go find my friend.
43103,Guy," I can't help it. You're hot. (He pulls Bonnie toward him and kisses her neck, Bonnie brings her hand up to his and uses her magic to burn him) Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah! (He cries in pain, pulling his hand away) What the hell did you do?"
43104,Bonnie, Can't help it. I'm hot. (He stares at Bonnie shocked as she walks past him)
43105,Elena, Did he have any bite marks on him?
43106,Stefan," No, which means she must have given him her bl*od."
43107,Elena, And he doesn't remember her feeding on him at all.
43108,Stefan," He remembers them making out in graphic detail, but that's about it."
43109,Elena, So that means she's covering her tracks. It's very thorough. It's actually really good.
43110,Stefan," No, it's not good. It means that she's gonna use him as a human bl*od bag every time she gets hungry."
43111,Elena, Or she'll drink from the bl*od bags in our fridge that she just restocked.
43112,Stefan, Wait a minute. Why are you defending her?
43113,Elena," I'm just saying she hasn't actually hurt anyone, and there's no bodies that have shown up at the med center, no students are missing. What if she actually has this under control? You know, we give her her year, she's happy, and then..."
43114,Stefan," And then what? She magically flips on her humanity switch and starts feeling everything that she's been putting off. Caroline is going to snap, and when it does, it's gonna be my fault because I am the reason that she did this."
43115,Elena, Pain is the reason that she did this.
43116,Stefan," Her mother died, her world was turning upside down. She asked me one simple question. All I had to do was tell her the truth, and I didn't. Now look me in the eye and tell me that I couldn't have stopped this. (Elena sighs and nods)"
43117,Elena, What's your plan?
43118,Bonnie," (Answering) Can't believe I'm about to say this, but I'm glad you called."
43119,Damon," Uh-oh! Caroline go off the rails? If so, I called it."
43120,Bonnie, Gloating in one of my best friend's times of need? It's weird that I miss you.
43121,Damon," Bonnie, I thought I was clear. Our relationship only exists within the confines of 1994. (Bonnie smiles)"
43122,Bonnie, You think one phone call makes us friends?
43123,Damon," You don't have to pretend, bon. I'm like a fever you can't shake."
43124,Bonnie, Yeah. Yeah. A disease.
43125,Damon, You ok?
43126,Bonnie," Well, if scorching some douchebag with my magic is ok, then, yeah, peachy. When you came back, did you just slide right back into your old life?"
43127,Damon," Oh, you mean the one where my brother was an auto mechanic and my girlfriend forgot she loved me? Yep."
43128,Bonnie," Um... why, um, why did you call me?"
43129,Damon," So... teensy favor. I don't know if you know this, but when Kai merged with Luke, he went through a metamorphosis. He went from a sociopathic caterpillar to a slightly less evil butterfly."
43130,Bonnie," Yeah. And anyone who believes that is an idiot. Please don't ever repeat that name to me again, ok?"
43131,Damon, Yeah. Ok. Heh. Already forgot about it.
43132,Bonnie, What was the favor?
43133,Damon, Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out on my own. Happy raving.
43134,Kai, Hey. Who was that?
43135,Damon, Bonnie. She doesn't want to do it. (He turns to face Kai) Doesn't believe there's a new you.
43136,Kai," But there is a new me. (Damon shrugs and Kai sighs) You... you explained it to her so she would understand, right? Small words, easy to digest."
43137,Damon, Not gonna happen. End of story.
43138,Kai, Huh. Shame... (He walks past Damon toward the fireplace) Because mama Salvatore's story is pretty fantastic. (He says with his eyes staring intently at the flames)
43139,Damon, What are you talking about?
43140,Kai," I have a strong lead on the ascendant. (He turns back to Damon) I checked the Gemini archives. Lily was captured on a dock in New York City in 1903. What if she was on her way here for you? I mean, it makes sense. She... she'd just landed from Europe, where... (he stops)"
43141,Damon, (staring at him wide eyed) Where what? Spit it out.
43142,Kai, (Grabbing his throat) Sorry (He says in a raspy voice)
43143,Damon," (Narrowing his eyes) You're not gonna tell me, are you?"
43144,Kai, (Coughs) No. Sorry. My throat just got really sore. I'm gonna go find a lozenge. (He clears his throat) Maybe Bonnie will change her mind by the time I find one. (He grins and brushes past Damon)
43145,Caroline," (Judging an outfit) Well, that's certainly a look."
43146,Stefan, Don't be jealous. (Caroline laughs and Stefan smiles)
43147,Caroline," You know, you should smile more. You're hot."
43148,Stefan," Oh, thank you."
43149,Caroline," And obviously you're here to babysit me, but I've had less attractive babysitters. Granted, they were old women, and I was 8."
43150,Stefan," I'm not here to babysit you, Caroline."
43151,Caroline," Yes, you are. You, Elena, Bonnie, you don't think that I can live a normal, humanityless vampire existence without k*ll anyone, and you feel guilty for being such a royal ass at my mom's funeral."
43152,Stefan," You're right. I was, and then when I came to apologize and tell you how I really felt, you were gone."
43153,Caroline, And now I don't care.
43154,Stefan," But I do, so let me tell you how I really feel."
43155,Caroline, I said I don't care.
43156,Stefan," (Ignoring her) I like you, Caroline."
43157,Caroline, Stop.
43158,Stefan," I don't know when it became more than friendship, but it did, and it scared me, so I-I pushed it away, but here we are."
43159,Caroline," (laughs, amused) Ha! Ha ha ha! Wow! See? That wasn't so hard, was it? Only took a couple of years, cancer to devour my mom, me to flip my humanity off, but you finally spit it out."
43160,Stefan, That's good. Anger. That means you want to feel.
43161,Caroline," No, Stefan. You know what? It just means that I'm pissed, so leave me alone. (She turns to walk away but Stefan stops her)"
43162,Stefan," Hey, hey. (He pulls her toward him) Let it in. It will hurt, and you'll want to die, but I will be here. I will help you through this, but you have to give me a chance. (He reaches out his hand and caresses her cheek) Please. (Caroline stares at him as if she's considering this for a moment) Come back. (She closes her eyes and leans her face into his hand for a second)"
43163,Caroline, (Snapping her eyes open and staring at him sadistically) You shouldn't have done that. (She pushed his hand away and leaves him alone at the bar disappearing into the crowd of ravers)
43164,Caroline, Hey! Where have you been?
43165,Liam," The bathroom line was, like, a mile long. I mean, look at all these crazy people here."
43166,Caroline, Wow! You are so boring. No wonder Elena didn't pick you. Honest truth. How good are you at surgery?
43167,Liam, I'm a premed sophomore. I'm terrible.
43168,Caroline, Perfect! Come with me. (She grabs his hand and leads him away from the party)
43169,Caroline," There you are. Finally! Where's your date? What, you don't want to show her off in front of Stefan?"
43170,Enzo, I'm afraid she doesn't find me nearly as fascinating as I do.
43171,Caroline, But you have an accent. Anything you say is automatically fascinating.
43172,Enzo," I'm afraid we found the exception. Told her I was a vampire, and her eyes glazed over literally. Pure and utter disinterest."
43173,Caroline, (breaks into laughter) Ha! Ha ha ha!
43174,Enzo, What's funny?
43175,Caroline," Stefan's been looking out for Sarah ever since she was a baby, which means he will protect her at any cost."
43176,Enzo, Ok.
43177,Caroline, So what do you do when you want someone to have nothing to do with vampires?
43178,Enzo," (Smiles) Heh. Compel them not to care about anything to do with vampires. Caroline Forbes, you're a genius."
43179,Caroline, Thank you. (She seductively puts her hands on him) Now why don't I show you some of my other talents? (She reaches her hands into his jacket and down his waist) Hmm?
43180,Enzo," (Pulling away) Sorry, luv. It's not as much fun when you're not really you. (He walks past her, but she is not bothered by the rejection. She grins and looks down at his cell phone which she had just stolen, she scrolls through the contacts and finds the name she is looking for. Sarah Salvatore.)"
43181,Damon, Hey.
43182,Bonnie, Hey! Hey. What are you doing here?
43183,Damon," Don't freak out, but... ahem. (He clears his throat and Kai walks out from around the corner)"
43184,Kai, Hi. (Bonnie is immediately alarmed)
43185,Damon, Just get this over with. (He grumbles to Kai)
43186,Kai, Um...
43187,Damon, Spit it out.
43188,Kai, Um... I wanted...
43189,Bonnie, Unh!
43190,Kai (V.O.), To apologize...
43191,Boonie, Aah!
43192,Kai (V.O.), For anything I did...
43193,Bonnie, Aah!
43194,Kai (V.O.), That hurt you.
43195,Kai, Bon? Did you hear what I said?
43196,Bonnie," If I see your face again, I will melt it off.  (She threatens him, then stalks past the both of them, angrily using her magic to open the door and stomps down the steps)"
43197,Kai, I imagined that going a little differently.
43198,Elena," Bonnie, hey. It's me. Where'd you go? Call me. (She hangs up, Stefan comes up behind her)"
43199,Stefan, Hey. It worked.
43200,Elena, It worked? You're Caroline's emotional trigger?
43201,Stefan, I saw it in her eyes. She's still in there. We just have to go find her.
43202,Elena," Wait. She's gone? Stefan, she made it very clear that if we mess with her she's gonna retaliate."
43203,Stefan," Then we find her, we lock her up, and I push until I break through. I can get her back, Elena."
43204,Elena, Ok. Ok. Let's go find her.
43205,Stefan," (answering) What, you really think I want to hear from you right now?"
43206,Caroline, Aw. Is someone having a bad night? (Elena and Stefan are equally surprised to hear Caroline's voice on Enzo's phone)
43207,Stefan, What are you doing with Enzo's phone?
43208,Caroline," I stole it, but that's not the question that you should be asking right now. You should be asking ""why does Enzo have Sarah Salvatore's number in his phone,"" or maybe ""where is Sarah Salvatore,"" and ultimately, ""what the hell are you going to do to her, Caroline?"""
43209,Sarah, Hello? Enzo?
43210,Caroling," (British accent) Over here, luv."
43211,Sarah," Oh. Um, actually, I'm looking for..."
43212,Caroline," Enzo. Yeah. I heard you. He's not here right now, but I am."
43213,Stefan," Caroline, what the hell are you doing with Sarah?"
43214,Caroline," There! An appropriate question. Thank you for asking. As a matter of fact, I'm going to k*ll her. (Caroline hangs up, dropping the phone onto the bar)"
43215,Damon," Hey. Calm down. It's just me. He's not here. Bonnie, this is about my mom. Kai knows a lot of stuff about my mom."
43216,Bonnie," I don't care. I told you I didn't want to see him again, and you did it anyway."
43217,Damon," I know, but, Bonnie..."
43218,Bonnie, (interrupting) Was I unclear?
43219,Damon, He just wanted to talk.
43220,Bonnie, Now I want to talk. So listen.
43221,Damon, I get that he hurt you.
43222,Bonnie, I said listen! (She uses her magic against Damon)
43223,Damon, Unh! (Damon clutches his chest)
43224,Bonnie, I want you to feel what I felt.
43225,Damon, Ow!
43226,Bonnie," You were there (bl*od soaks through Damon's shirt from a wound that Bonnie made appear) the first time he hurt me, an arrow through the stomach, but you weren't there for what happened next, when he chased me through the hospital, (Damon gasps and groans) when he strangled me, (Bonnie uses her magic against him again; Damon chokes and grabs his throat) he drugged me, he tied me up, and he stuck me in a trunk, and then suddenly, he wants to be nice, huh, start over."
43227,Damon, Bonnie.
43228,Bonnie," Sound familiar? He lied, and then he stabbed he again! (She uses her magic against him again to make another wound)"
43229,Damon, Unh! (Damon clutches his stomach as bl*od pours out)
43230,Bonnie," Then came the worst part because when it was all over he left me alone... (She says in tears) And I wish I could share what that feels like, but I can't. (She releases him, he gasps and coughs) I want you to get out."
43231,Damon," Bonnie, I'm sorry."
43232,Bonnie, (She screams at him in rage) Get out! (He leaves as she turns back to the fire)
43233,Caroline, Hey! I'm making margaritas. You want one?
43234,Elena, Where's Sarah?
43235,Caroline, I see Stefan filled you in on his big secret.
43236,Stefan," Where is she, Caroline?"
43237,Caroline, Not here. That would be stupid. (She says as she preps the glasses with salt) She's with Liam. Say hi! (She says looking over to Enzo's phone which is on speaker with Sarah's name flashing in)
43238,Liam (on phone), (shaky and in a panic) Hello?
43239,Caroline, Sarah is helping Liam with his surgical k*ll.
43240,Sarah, Please! Please don't hurt me!
43241,Liam, I don't want to do this! (He screams)
43242,Caroline, Duh. You're probably gonna get expelled and then found guilty of m*rder. That's why I compelled you to do what I wanted.
43243,Sarah," No, please! Please!"
43244,Stefan," Look, Caroline. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you."
43245,Caroline, Obviously. I was pretty clear about that.
43246,Elena," Look. I know that you can't feel it right now, Care, but if you k*ll Sarah, it's gonna haunt you forever. Trust me. I did it, and it sucks. (Caroline pours the margarita mix into the glasses)"
43247,Caroline," I compelled a student to perform surgery on Stefan's niece, and you found a way to make this about you? God, you truly have a gift, Elena. (She laughs)"
43248,Stefan," Look at me, Caroline. What do you want me to do? You want me to leave town, I'll leave town. I'll stay as far away from you as possible. Just please let her go."
43249,Caroline," That's the problem, Stefan. It doesn't really matter how far away you are. You're still you... Kind, loyal, (She puts little umbrellas into the margaritas) who with one look can convince me that I'm not crazy. That's the Stefan that I fell for, and that's the Stefan who can bring me back."
43250,Stefan, k*ll Sarah isn't gonna change that.
43251,Caroline," I know. That's why I'd rather just change you. Let go of that part of you, Stefan."
43252,Elena," Caroline, what are you talking about?"
43253,Caroline," If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life, (She raises up two glasses of margaritas) all he has to do is shut his humanity off. Why are you both looking at me like that? Do I need to repeat myself?"
43254,Elena, He is not turning his humanity off.
43255,Caroline," (Setting the glasses down on the bar) Elena, Stefan unleashed himself from you months ago. He can think for himself now."
43256,Stefan," It's not gonna happen, Caroline."
43257,Caroline," (Picking up the phone) Hey, Liam."
43258,Sarah," No! Please! No, no!"
43259,Caroline, Cut out her spleen.
43260,Elena, Caroline!
43261,Caroline," Relax. She can live without a spleen. You know, it's really the infection you should be worried about."
43262,Sarah, Please don't hurt me! No! No! No!
43263,Liam," I'm so sorry. (She screams as Liam uses the scapel to cut against her skin, bl*od oozes out)"
43264,Stefan," Hey, Liam. Remember that conversation we had earlier about being honest? Where are you?"
43265,Caroline," Don't answer him, Liam."
43266,Liam, Whitmore Medical.
43267,Caroline, Hey!
43268,Sarah, Please don't hurt me! (Liam slices her again with the scapel and she screams) Aah!
43269,Stefan, (To Elena) Go! Get Sarah out of there. (Elena vamp speeds away)
43270,Caroline, Good luck getting there in time.
43271,Caroline," How's it going, Liam?"
43272,Sarah," (screaming) Please, Liam! No, no!"
43273,Liam, (His eyes are wide in terror) I think I'm gonna go into pediatrics.
43274,Caroline, You know what? I changed my mind. Leave the spleen. (Liam relaxes taking a breath) Let's be a little bit more symbolic.
43275,Sarah, (screaming) Please no!
43276,Caroline, Take out her heart.
43277,Caroline," Liam, you still with me?"
43278,Damon, I'm not in the mood for the preamble. Just tell me why my mom's stuck in 1903.
43279,Kai, You're not bringing your mom back.
43280,Damon, That's odd. (He says turning to face Kai) Sounds like you just asked me to k*ll you.
43281,Kai," You requested a truncated version, so I respectfully jumped to the end."
43282,Damon, (He gets up) And why aren't we bringing her back?
43283,Kai," Because there are only two prison worlds in existence, mine, created in 1994, and the one created in 1903 for the sole purpose of locking up your mom and her closet full of crazy pants."
43284,Damon, (enraged) You said we'd get her back!
43285,Kai," (Calm) I'm telling you, as a semi-sane person, you really don't want that."
43286,Damon, And I'm telling you as a vampire who eats people you really don't want to piss me off!
43287,Kai, I'm trying to save your life.
43288,Damon, Tell me how to get her back!
43289,Kai," Your mom's a ripper, ok? She's a ripper. (Damon releases him, stunned) She turned in 1858, faked her death, went to Europe, where she went a little nuts."
43290,Damon, (Whispers) No.
43291,Kai," Bodies piled up, she moved, k*ll some more until she had to move again. They think 3,000 in total."
43292,Damon, (Whispers) That's enough.
43293,Kai," And for some reason, my coven made it their duty to stop her, so they cut her off at New York Harbor before she could tear through Manhattan. Granted... heh... By the time they got the ship, they found everybody dead. It was so gruesome they had to burn it there at the harbor."
43294,Damon, I said that's enough! (He screams)
43295,Kai, (quietly) I guess I should show myself out. (He leaves and Damon falls back onto the floor devastated by this revelation)
43296,Jeremy (voice-mail), Hey. It's Jeremy. Leave a message.
43297,Bonnie," Hey, Jeremy. It's Bonnie. It's a really long story, but I'm back. Uh, I had this whole plan to drive out to new Mexico and surprise you, I don't know, show up as one of the models in your drawing class or something. (She laughs) Um... listen, Jer. I'm not sure I'm still the same Bonnie you want to be with. That place changed me, and I don't know if I'm scared of myself or actually kind of like the new me. If it's ok with you, I think I'm just gonna figure me out, and then I promise to come visit you. I hope you're well. Ok. Bye, Jer. (She hangs up and looks at herself in the mirror, lifting up her shirt to look at her scars)"
43298,Sarah," Aah! No! Please! (Liam cuts her shirt open) Liam! Liam, no! Aah!"
43299,Liam, You're marking it worse. You'll only make it worse.
43300,Sarah," You'll k*ll me! Liam, I'll die! Liam! (He shoves a cloth in her mouth to stop the screaming)"
43301,Liam, I never used one of these before. I'm so sorry. (Sarah screams)
43302,Caroline," You don't realize it, but this really does hurt me to watch. (She sighs) I'm pathetic. (Into her Phone) Liam, she stopped screaming. Is she..."
43303,Liam, I think she passed out.
43304,Caroline, (Sigh) k*ll her. Call me when it's done. (She hangs up the phone and shoves it in her back pocket)
43305,Caroline, (Stepping over him) Stefan's phone.
43306,Elena," (Racing through the hospital hallways) Caroline, where are they?"
43307,Caroline," Hey. You're gonna be a doctor, right? How long can one live without their heart? Maybe, like, 3 seconds tops? (Stefan gets to his feet)"
43308,Stefan," She's gonna let her die, Elena."
43309,Elena, I can't find them anywhere. We're running out of time! (Caroline turns to Stefan)
43310,Stefan, Bring me back.
43311,Elena," What? Stefan, w-what do you mean? Bring you back from where?"
43312,Stefan, Just remember to bring me back.
43313,Elena," No. No. No, no, no, no. Stefan! No! Stefan, no!"
43314,Elena, (Looking at her phone) Stefan. No.
43315,Elena," Oh, my God."
43316,Liam," Elena, I'm so sorry. I don't know what I'm doing."
43317,Elena, Just stop. (Elena bites into her wrist and feeds Sarah her bl*od)
43318,Liam, (upset) I have to take out her heart. (Liam goes for Sarah's chest but Elena stops him by breaking both of his hands) Ah! (He grunts and falls to the ground; Elena continues to feed Sarah her bl*od until Sarah starts to cough and becomes concious again)
43319,Elena, (relieved) No. It's ok. Everything's gonna be ok.
43320,Stefan, Hello.
43321,Elena," (Out of breath) Stefan, hey. Thank God. I found her. I... She's gonna be ok."
43322,Stefan," Oh, really?"
43323,Elena," Stefan, are you ok?"
43324,Stefan," Well, I will be in one second. (He takes a sip of his drink) Mmm. I really needed that."
43325,Elena," Please don't tell me that you shut it off. (Stefan doesn't answer) Stefan, don't you dare tell me that you shut it off!"
43326,Stefan, Ok. I won't. (He passes the phone to Caroline who is laying on the bar)
43327,Caroline, He shut it off. (She hangs up the phone and tosses it aside; she grins and Stefan drinks his margarita)
43328,Woman, Who are you?
43329,Bonnie, Who are you?
43330,Damon," Oh, my God. That's my mother."
43331,Kai," There are only two prison worlds in existence, mine and the one created in 1903 for locking up your mom and her closet full of crazy pants."
43332,Damon, Tell me how to get her back!
43333,Kai, Your mom's a ripper!
43334,Enzo, Meet the real Sarah Salvatore. I'm going to make her do things she'd never dream of doing until she begs me to make her a vampire.
43335,Jo, I'm pregnant.
43336,Alaric, Marry me.
43337,Jo, Yes.
43338,Caroline," My mom is dead, and I just need the pain to be gone."
43339,Caroline," If anyone tries to flip my humanity switch back on, I'll become your worst nightmare."
43340,Stefan, I like you.
43341,Caroline, Stop.
43342,Stefan, Come back.
43343,Stefan, What the hell are you doing with Sarah?
43344,Caroline, I'm going to k*ll her.
43345,Caroline," If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life, all he has to do is shut his humanity off."
43346,Stefan, Just remember to bring me back.
43347,Elena," Stefan, don't you dare shut it off."
43348,Enzo," A hard knock life, isn't it?"
43349,Caroline, Don't walk there. Ugh! (grabbing a mop) I just washed that.
43350,Enzo," My apologies, Cinderella. What are you doing?"
43351,Caroline," Stefan and I had a moment. Things broke in the process, and now I'm returning the Scull Bar to the way we found it."
43352,Enzo," Uh, the whole point of flipping your humanity switch is that you don't care how you leave things."
43353,Caroline," (sighs) I go to school here, Enzo. I want to keep going to school here, and the second that I draw any suspicions -- break-ins, broken property, dead bodies -- people will try to interrupt my routine. Then I will end up rotting in a cell somewhere instead of what I should be doing, which is preparing for my audition tomorrow."
43354,Enzo," You, Caroline Forbes, vampire without humanity, auditioning for the school play?"
43355,Caroline," Musical. And obviously, duh. I'm a drama major. And what are you doing here?"
43356,Enzo," Find my Phone led me here, though it didn't explain why your stick little fingers needed it last night."
43357,Caroline, Because you're the only one with Sarah Salvatore's phone number.
43358,Enzo, Why'd you need Sarah's number?
43359,Caroline, To use her life as leverage to convince Stefan to shut his humanity switch off too.
43360,Enzo, (concerned) That's both clever and deeply unsettling. Tell me she's still alive.
43361,Caroline," She's alive, assuming she survived any infections resulting from Liam's amateur surgery."
43362,Enzo, (realizing his revenge plan won't work) Which means Stefan's humanity's a thing of the past.
43363,Caroline," Like I said, I will stop at nothing to maintain my routine, so I suggest that you stay away. Now if you don't mind, (hands Enzo the mop) I need to prepare for my audition."
43364,Damon, How was the rave?
43365,Stefan," Oh, you know, loud, lame, rave-like."
43366,Damon, Anything I should know or anything you'd like to talk about bro to bro?
43367,Stefan, Where do we keep our w*apon?
43368,Damon, Pardon? (gets up)
43369,Stefan," Crossbows, Vervain grenades, all that hunter crap Jeremy was into? Ah! Yes! The throne."
43370,Stefan, Elena told on me. Shocker.
43371,Damon," Not a good time for a humanity flip, brother. (Stefan breaks his hand and he drops the vervain syringe)"
43372,Stefan, Do yourself a favor. Stay out of my way today.
43373,Jo," Whoa, easy."
43374,Sarah, Where am I?
43375,Jo, You're at Whitmore Medical Center. I'm Dr. Laughlin.
43376,Sarah, Last night...
43377,Jo, You had a little too much to drink. A professor found you passed out on the quad.
43378,Sarah, I sort of remember that. It was like a spring break kickoff rave. (Jo nods and she starts to get up) I should get home.
43379,Jo," Actually, I need you to sit tight. We need to look after you for a while. You lost a lot of fluids last night. Okay? (Sarah reluctantly lies back down and Jo leaves the room as Sarah checks her arm)"
43380,Jo," For the record, I am not okay with turning my hospital into a supernatural holding cell."
43381,Alaric," Okay, look. It's the first day of spring break. The campus is like a ghost town. Besides, we need to keep her out of harm's way until Elena's bl*od is out of her system. Unless, of course, you want to invite another Salvatore vampire to our wedding."
43382,Jo, I'm starting to think eloping is the way to go.
43383,Alaric," Heh, yeah. Yeah, me too. (they kiss) Look, she's been compelled to forget last night. And soon, she'll be back at Duke, safe with no idea what happened and no one the wiser."
43384,Jo," Huh, Duke. That's not bad. It's a little obnoxious but kind of in a cute way, you know? Little Duke."
43385,Alaric, Whoa. Wait. We're thinking baby names?
43386,Jo, You haven't been?
43387,Alaric, No. I have! No. I have. I totally have.
43388,Jo, Name one.
43389,Alaric, (tries to think) Josette Jr.
43390,Jo, Get out of here. (she kisses him) I have rounds. (they walk in opposite directions)
43391,Elena, Damon. What are you doing?
43392,Damon," Looking for a... healthy outlet for my rage. (knocks down a lamp, shocking Elena) I haven't found it yet. Stefan without his humanity is one artery away from Stefan the ripper, and every day that goes by is one year of guilt waiting for him on the other side."
43393,Elena," Yeah. Well, not to add to our growing pile of bad news, but we didn't just lose Stefan. We lost our chance to spark Caroline's humanity. Turns out he was her emotional trigger. (Damon offers her the poker) No thanks."
43394,Damon," Well, take it away from me. Because I'm seconds away from using it on this. (grabs the video camera that Bonnie brought back from the prison world)"
43395,Elena, (takes the poker and sets it down) Who is that?
43396,Damon, This... (shows Elena the camera) is Lillian Salvatore.
43397,Elena, Your mother is alive? (takes the camera for a closer look)
43398,Damon, Yep. Turns out she's been in a prison world snapshot of 1903 for over a century.
43399,Elena, Your mother is alive.
43400,Damon," Oh, yeah. Alive and well. Not in the pine box that I thought I buried her in in 1858. And apparently, she's a vampire and not just any kind of vampire either-"
43401,Elena," Damon, your mother is alive!"
43402,Damon," She's a ripper, Elena. Makes perfect sense. Stefan was always such a mama's boy."
43403,Elena, How much of a mama's boy?
43404,Damon, He would have hanged himself with mother's apron strings if it meant her approval. We both would. We loved her. She was our world.
43405,Damon, What? No. No way.
43406,Elena, This is our way to get Stefan back! You can't tell me that his mother isn't an emotional trigger.
43407,Damon," Elena, this woman k*ll so many people that an entire coven of witches built her a permanent timeout! You don't fix one ripper problem by unleashing another ripper."
43408,Elena," Think about it. If this works, we don't just get Stefan and Caroline back. We get your mother back. Aren't you even a little curious to see her?"
43409,Damon, I might know a few witches that could help.
43410,Bonnie, I'm not helping you. (Tries to shut the door on his face but Damon puts his leg in between.)
43411,Damon, Ow.
43412,Bonnie," I hate Kai, and you know that, and the first thing you did when I got back was throw him in my face to fake apologize."
43413,Damon," Yeah, and then I real apologized for being a dick."
43414,Bonnie, And here you are less than 24 hours later asking me to work with him.
43415,Damon," Bonnie, we need Kai to get to 1903, and we need Bennett bl*od to do the damn spell. Listen. We go in, we grab my mom, she flips Stefan's switch, he triggers Caroline, emotional dominoes, heyyyy! Everybody wins."
43416,Bonnie," If I give you my bl*od, will you just get out of my face?"
43417,Damon," Probably... although I think you're gonna want to join us. Stick with me, Bonnie Bennett. I might just have the answer to all your prayers."
43418,Kai," You want the 1903 Ascendant. Well, sure. Just let me reach in my pocket and pull it out."
43419,Bonnie," If you're sincerely looking for a way to make up for the hell that you put me through, this is it."
43420,Kai," OK. The problem is the Gemini kept the existence of the 1903 prison world a secret for generations, so find the key to that particular jail cell, I'd have to navigate ancient texts, undo layers of magical cloaking spells, and... Wait. (reaches into his pockets and pulls out the Ascendant) Oh, that's weird. Ha ha! It was in my pocket. When Damon told me about mama Salvatore, I started looking, and if I wanted to, (Bonnie reaches for the Ascendant, but Kai pulls his hand back) .. I could get her out. Newly minted leader of the Gemini coven and all, I don't even need a celestial event to zap us there. (sets the Ascendant on the table)"
43421,Bonnie, OK. So what's the catch?
43422,Kai," I'll go if you go. Come on. It could be fun, you know, 1903, the... the Gilded Age. Didn't you ever dream about time travel?"
43423,Bonnie, I would rather die of cholera than spend an afternoon with you.
43424,Kai," You're way more likely to die at the hands of your gal pal Caroline. I bet it will be over something stupid like she stops doing laundry, and you make some snippy comment, and she snips off your tongue. I'm mean, if only there were some way to reunite her with her humanity."
43425,Caroline,"
♪ maybe there's somewhere ♪
♪ a lesson to learn ♪
♪ but that wouldn't change the fact ♪
♪ that wouldn't speed the time ♪
♪ once the foundation's cracked ♪
♪ and I'm ♪
♪ still hurting ♪"
43426,Stefan," Moving. Truly. Although it did lack a certain, um, authenticity."
43427,Caroline, What the hell are you doing? That was the director!
43428,Stefan," And you are a vampire without humanity, singing about heartbreak."
43429,Caroline," It's a performance, Stefan."
43430,Stefan," (as he speaks, he gets up and walks down the stairs towards the stage) It sure is, Caroline, especially this carefully crafted good student routine, straight and narrow, anything to keep you from making a mistake you might regret one year from now when you flip your switch back on. Oh, except the whole ruining my life part."
43431,Caroline," Well, if your humanity's off, then you shouldn't really care how I deal."
43432,Stefan," No, no, no. See, that's where you're wrong because like you, I'm prone to doing bad things when my humanity is off, but unlike you, I don't have an elaborate system to keep me in check."
43433,Caroline, Well that's not my problem.
43434,Stefan," Well, I'm making it your problem. If my life is gonna fall apart when my humanity starts flooding back, then so is yours. When I'm done with you, you'll be drowning in mistakes."
43435,Caroline, (walks toward Stefan) This is seriously about revenge?
43436,Stefan," Yes, it is, and this... (holds up his hands, which are covered in bl*od) .. this is a control freak's worst nightmare. This is me undoing your routine. This is me... (Stefan wipes bl*od onto Caroline's lips, causing her face to vamp out) .. forcing you to let go one day at a time until you break. (he leaves the auditorium)"
43437,Kai, Damn. Crocodile Dundee called. He wants his kn*fe back.
43438,Bonnie," Yeah. You know, he's no longer a thing, and neither is that joke. (Damon walks in wearing a coat)"
43439,Kai, Ouch.
43440,Elena, Is this presentable attire by 1903 standards?
43441,Damon, Whoa. Who said you're coming?
43442,Elena, To meet the woman who gave birth to the two epic loves of my life? Heh. Me.
43443,Kai," Powerful as I am, there's a limit to how many people one witch can transport with this spell."
43444,Bonnie, Which is why there's two of us. Shall we?
43445,Damon, Fine. Let's go get mama.
43446,Kai, Sangiema meam et nos mundo carcerema. Sangiema meam et nos mundo carcerema.
43447,Damon," Well, isn't this a picturesque slice of hell?"
43448,Bonnie, You guys go ahead. Kai and I will start the locator spell on the Ascendant.
43449,Elena, But Kai just had the Ascendant. Why do we have to find another one?
43450,Kai," The Ascendant can't travel between worlds, which means we gotta find its mirror image here in 1903."
43451,Damon," (sarcastically, as he zips up his jacket) Page 10 on the world-jumping rulebook. Shall we? (walks off)"
43452,Elena, I don't want to leave you alone with him.
43453,Bonnie," I'll be fine. (Kai is catching snow on his tongue) He's good now, remember? New leaf. (she goes to join Damon)"
43454,Kai, New leaf? You believe me.
43455,Bonnie," Hell no, but Damon and Elena need to meet his mom alone. So shut up and let's find the Ascendant. (holds up her hand)"
43456,Caroline," Oh, sh**t. Is your bike OK? (Stefan gets off) Do you need money for the bus?"
43457,Stefan, Seriously?
43458,Caroline, I just had to stuff the director's body into a furnace. Do you know how hard it was to get an audition during spring break?
43459,Stefan," Oh, come on. It was easy for you, Caroline. All you had to do was shed some tears about your mom's funeral, play the cancer card, and - boom - your precious routine is back on track. (gets down to put his bike back together) Am I wrong?"
43460,Caroline, This is your only warning. Go away.
43461,Stefan," Neat, organized Caroline. Staying within the lines. Good at control, terrible at revenge."
43462,Caroline, I dismantled your bike.
43463,Stefan," I tore your director's head off with my teeth. Oh, my God. Caroline, literally just unbolt this damn thing? I mean, it's gonna take me, what, 10 minutes to put this back together? You are an embarrassment to humanity-free vampires everywhere."
43464,Alaric, OK. So I've got a few. You ready?
43465,Jo," Actually, I thought about it, and anyone named Alaric should not be allowed to name another human."
43466,Alaric," Uh, I didn't name me."
43467,Jo, True. OK. You can have veto power.
43468,Alaric," Good. Well, then I veto Duke."
43469,Jo, Ha ha!
43470,Alaric," Uh, let me call you right back. (hangs up) What are you doing here?"
43471,Enzo, Really hoping you got enough vervain to get blondie and her cohort from here to the Salvatore cellar without further drama.
43472,Alaric," You do realize I'm a human, right? Up against two vampires without remorse?"
43473,Enzo," Ah. I see. Your girl has got a bun in the oven, and now you've gone all g*n. Vamp hearing."
43474,Alaric," You know, I'd actually like my child to grow up with a father."
43475,Enzo," Granted, a cowardly father. Probably play catch and run from the ball or go fishing an flee from the fish."
43476,Alaric, I have w*apon in my apartment.
43477,Elena," Can we just take a second to acknowledge how insane it is that we're standing in the house that you grew up in? (Elena finds a tin-type photo of one of the brothers from when they were young children on the mantle and coos happily) Awww, Damon! (She picks up the photograph and examines it before showing it to Damon) You were so adorable!"
43478,Damon," Aww, thanks! (He looks at the photo and grimaces) Except... that's Stefan. (He sees another photo on the mantle of himself as a child with his mother and grabs it) This is me. (He pauses for a moment and stares at it before handing it over to Elena) We're not here to socialize. We get the Ascendant, we find my mother, and after she flips Stefan's switch, we figure out what the hell we're going to do with her."
43479,Elena," (continues looking at the baby photo of Damon) Aw, you can give her another chance?"
43480,Damon, (snoops through the desk) Chance to what? Disarray another literal boatload of people?
43481,Elena, Stefan was a Ripper. You never gave up on him.
43482,Damon," And where was Lily from 1858 to 1903? She was blood-binge-ing through Europe while Stefan and I carried the loss. (Elena looks at him sympathetically) Not exactly maternal, Elena. Far as I'm concerned, my mother died when we buried her empty coffin. What we're looking for is just a tool to get my brother back."
43483,Lily, (shocked) Damon?
43484,Damon," (overwhelmed) Hello, mother."
43485,Lily," There was a time I marked days on a calendar. (She joins them at the coffee table and pours them each a cup of tea before sitting across from them) I gave up after a few years, but, judging by your bizarre attire..."
43486,Elena, You've been in here for over a century...
43487,Damon," (sarcastically) Yeah, I would have come by sooner, but I thought you were safe and sound in the family crypt. (He smiles fakely) My bad."
43488,Lily," (smiles guiltily) Technically, I did die in 1858, after a nurse in the TB ward fed me vampire bl*od."
43489,Damon, And you never thought to stop by and clear things up?
43490,Elena," How did you end up here, Mrs. Salvatore?"
43491,Damon, (whispers) Mrs. Salvatore?
43492,Elena, (whispers back) I don't know what to call her.
43493,Lily," (chuckles) Please, call me Lily. (She sits down across from them again) It was October 31st, 1903. (She dips a tea bag into each of their cups. Next to the cups is a sealed jar of bl*od and a small dropper) I had just arrived in New York Harbor. The night sky was alive with this beautiful shimmering light. And, out of nowhere, a coven of witches attacked. When I woke, they were gone. Everyone was gone. (She chuckles nervously) That night, the sky danced with colors again, and it's done so every night since."
43494,Damon," It's called ""prison."" You must have pissed off a lot of people."
43495,Lily, (smiles) That life seems like forever ago.
43496,Damon, You on a diet?
43497,Lily," I depleted every slaughterhouse within walking distance, and every butcher's shop along the hellish trek from New York to Mystic Falls. (She picks up the jar of bl*od and shows it to them) This is the last of the bl*od here, heh. Two drops a week, just to stay awake."
43498,Elena, That sounds miserable.
43499,Lily, (smiles) I manage. (She looks at Damon) I heard you and your brother turned during the w*r.
43500,Damon, Mmhmm.
43501,Lily, (sips her tea) Your father must have been horrified.
43502,Damon," He was! And then, Stefan ripped his throat out."
43503,Lily, I apologize - that's cruel to laugh - but... good for Stefan. (Damon nods at her) I truly hated that man.
43504,Damon," Oh, I know you did. So much so that you left your kids with him, faked your own death, and then went out to join the Ripper Coalition."
43505,Lily," (smiles tightly) Well, it's nice to see that you've grown into yourself, Damon. (Damon smiles back, but Lily's smile falls quickly) How's your brother?"
43506,Caroline, Hello? Is anyone there?
43507,Caroline," Damnit, Stefan! What do you want?"
43508,Stefan," (pretends to grab a soda can) Uh, I brought you a little peace-offering. I figured with all that singing, and furnace-stuffing, you must be parched."
43509,Stefan," Now, see, this is how a vampire with no humanity is supposed to act! I am inflicting actual pain!"
43510,Caroline, (groans) Leave me alone!
43511,Stefan, Why? You thinking about giving in? Letting go? Breaking your code?
43512,Caroline," Stefan, stop!"
43513,Stefan," Come on, Caroline! Just let go! I promise it'll feel good."
43514,Caroline, I am not going to let you ruin my life.
43515,Stefan, Okay! Then I'll end it.
43516,Stefan, (shouts in pain) Ahh! Ahhh!
43517,Kai, You have really nice palms.
43518,Bonnie," Phesmatos tribum, nas ex veras, sequitas sanguinum. Phesmatos tribum, nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinum."
43519,Kai, (blurts out) Do you know why I'm here?
43520,Kai," Because my guilt keeps me up at night. (Bonnie continues to ignore him, and Kai sighs) I don't-I don't expect you to believe me. But I need you to give me one more chance."
43521,Kai, Bonnie! LISTEN TO ME!
43522,Kai," (guilty) Sorry, I... Oh my God, I didn't... I didn't mean to do that..."
43523,Bonnie," (cuts him off) But you did it anyway. Because even if you're telling the truth, the old you is still inside of you. (She glares at him) The Ascendant is this way."
43524,Lily," (confused) And, you believe I can reconnect Stefan with his humanity?"
43525,Elena," The last memory Stefan has of you is a vision of an angel telling him ""Everything is going to be okay."""
43526,Damon," So, you're gonna be an angel again. He doesn't need to how how screwed-up you really are."
43527,Lily, Of course I'll help! I'd love nothing more than to see him again.
43528,Damon, (smacks the table and stands up) Pack your bags.
43529,Lily," (stands up as well) Wonderful! (She laughs in excitement) I'll alert the others, hmm?"
43530,Damon," You'll alert who, now?"
43531,Lily," You knew so much about me, I assumed you'd heard of my traveling companions?"
43532,Damon, (uneasy) What traveling companions?
43533,Lily," Everyone, meet my son Damon. He's here to take us home."
43534,Enzo, There you are! Definite role-model material.
43535,Alaric, (incredulously) Damon really spent five years in a cell with you without k*ll himself?
43536,Enzo," Oh, a fellow smart-ass. I see why you were his drinking buddy. Oh, you're gonna have to knock-off the hard stuff while you're breastfeeding, mate."
43537,Alaric," (annoyed) You know, what are you even doing here? I thought you hated Stefan."
43538,Enzo," Yeah, I do. In fact, I have a whole elaborate revenge-scheme against him. But, unfortunately, in order to truly hurt someone, they have to care."
43539,Alaric," So, you want Stefan's humanity back just to remind him how much you two hate each other?"
43540,Enzo, (shrugs) A game's more fun with two players.
43541,Alaric," You know, last night, an innocent girl had an involuntary splenectomy because you brought her into your life. (Enzo sighs and rolls his eyes) Now, if this is your idea of fun? You need to take a long look in the mirror, pal."
43542,Enzo, And what? Reevaluate my flippant disregard for human life?
43543,Alaric," (smirks) Nah, just your deep, obvious loneliness."
43544,Enzo," (impressed) Oh, got me there! Yeah, I'm just a sad nobody, up to no good, while you're at home ticking off your life milestones. (He starts counting on his fingers as he speaks) Girl, kid, death. Heh. (His voice becomes bitter) Sounds lovely."
43545,Girl, What are you doing?
43546,Caroline," (annoyed) What are you doing? It's called ""spring break."""
43547,Girl, It's called practice. (She notices that Stefan has a piece of wood in his stomach and becomes alarmed) Is he okay?
43548,Caroline, (sighs in annoyance and walks toward the girl) He's fine.
43549,Caroline," (frustrated) Nice going, you jackass!"
43550,Stefan, Second lesson in losing control: No... Saving... Strangers.
43551,Caroline," (compels her) Go to your room. I'll deal with you later. (As the girl runs away, Caroline addresses Stefan) So, to summarize, ""letting go"" means being an idiot, increasing your chances of getting caught, and worst of all, actively making choices..."
43552,Stefan, Shhh. Shhh.
43553,Alaric," Uhhh, Enzo?"
43554,Enzo, (sighs) Bollocks.
43555,Elena, These vampires have been trapped here with you? The whole time?
43556,Lily," We went everywhere together. They happened to be on the boat that night, poor souls."
43557,Damon," (in disbelief) These... poor souls... don't happen to have the same affinity for rolling heads, do they?"
43558,Lily," On the contrary, these people saved me from that part of myself. I was banished here because I was a monster. I drank with no remorse from whatever human I could sink my teeth into. But, locked in this cage, I was forced to confront the animal I had become. (She affectionately straightens up the handkerchief in one of her male friends' pockets) And, as we ran out of resources, my friends sacrificed their rations for me. And, I knew if I drank everything, as every bone in my body demanded, there wouldn't be enough to wake them. So, I learned to control my bloodlust, for them. These people made me feel human again."
43559,Lily, I'll fetch the rest of the bl*od so we can revive them.
43560,Damon, Not only is she a Ripper... (He lowers his voice to a whisper) .. she's an insane Ripper!
43561,Elena," Or, maybe she feels responsible for them?"
43562,Damon," (continues to whisper) What, are you kidding me? Vampire dollhouse?"
43563,Elena, Damon! Isn't this the Ascendant?
43564,Damon, (nods awkwardly) Yeah.
43565,Elena, (opens the Ascendant) Why isn't Bonnie here?
43566,Damon," (sighs and speaks quietly) Because Bonnie isn't looking for the Ascendant, Elena."
43567,Bonnie, The spell feels stronger. The Ascendant must be around here somewhere.
43568,Kai, (confused) Why would the Ascendant be here?
43569,Bonnie," I don't know, I didn't put it here."
43570,Kai," If you don't think I'm capable of change, why spend an entire day with me? Why bring me out into the middle of nowhere? (Bonnie looks uncomfortable, and doesn't turn around to face him) I could gut you all over again. Your friends would never even hear you scream."
43571,Bonnie," (sighs and finally turns to face him) Because maybe you're right. Maybe, deep down, there's a part of me that believes there's a sliver of good in you."
43572,Kai," (laughs) And, you'd be right! (He continues to laugh and walks past her) Looking, looking, and... nope, they didn't hide the Ascendant in a random pile of..."
43573,Kai, Bonnie!
43574,Kai, (panting) What are you doing?
43575,Bonnie," Gaining your trust, and then stabbing you in the back? Feels pretty sucky, doesn't it?"
43576,Kai," (pleads) Please, don't."
43577,Bonnie, (angrily) Don't what? Don't-don't leave you here? All alone? Drive you to the point of wanting to end your own life? (She completely loses her temper and shouts at the top of her lungs) I almost k*ll myself because of you!
43578,Kai," (terrified) Please, please, believe me! I've changed!"
43579,Bonnie, (holding the kn*fe up above him) I know. I know. (She grits her teeth) So have I.
43580,Caroline, At least they're still breathing.
43581,Stefan," Aw, Damon must be up to something really good if he sent the B-team. (He picks up another broken piece of wood off of the floor and waves it in the air) What do you say we send them a little message?"
43582,Stefan," Stopping you from leaving the cleaning staff two dead bodies. Not to mention, k*ll Elena's former guardian and your brother's best friend. Did you like being locked up and tortured to get your humanity back?"
43583,Stefan," (laughs patronizingly) It must be so exhausting, over-thinking everything. (He walks toward her) Denying your own urge to k*ll. (He pushes his chest right up against the end of the sh**t r*fle) Just be done with them."
43584,Caroline, (cocks her g*n and glares at him) Back. Away.
43585,Stefan, (sighs in disappointment) Fine. If that's what you want.
43586,Caroline, ...Hey!
43587,Caroline, Where are you going?
43588,Stefan," You think I don't know everything about you? I taught you how to control your bloodlust, remember? (Stefan flips the girl around so she's facing him and compels her) Stay still, and don't scream."
43589,Caroline, (unamused) What are you doing?
43590,Stefan, The thing that you keep resisting.
43591,Caroline," If you're trying to tempt me, it's not working."
43592,Stefan," I don't have to try. Deep down, you and I are exactly the same, Caroline. Come on, you can break routine for a second, right? (He spins the girl, who is swaying on the feet, around so she's facing Caroline. His hand is holding the girl's head to the side so her throat is bared to her, and he smiles cutely at her) She has a really pretty neck."
43593,Damon, Your vampire-menagerie is going to have to take the next train out. We're down a witch.
43594,Lily," (in disbelief) You want to leave them behind? No, Damon, you can't save me without saving them."
43595,Damon, We'll come back for them. Promise. Let's go.
43596,Elena," Damon, look outside! Is that the Aurora Borealis?"
43597,Bonnie, Also known as our ticket out of here. (She looks at Elena) You got it?
43598,Elena, Yeah!
43599,Bonnie, (takes the Ascendant) Okay.
43600,Damon," (notices Lily has vanished) You gotta be kidding me! (He looks at the girls, clearly frustrated, and sighs) Go. Start the damn spell. I'll go get her."
43601,Lily, Time to wake up!
43602,Lily, No!
43603,Damon," I said, they're not coming."
43604,Lily, What have you done?
43605,Damon, We'll see them after the reunion. Let's go.
43606,Lily," You don't understand, Damon. I will not leave them!"
43607,Damon, Too bad.
43608,Lily," They're my family! (Damon looks at her, extremely hurt by these words) These people are my family."
43609,Damon," (looks around for a moment) These freaks may be your family, but Stefan Salvatore is mine, and if you don't want to help him, I will leave you here to rot! (Lily looks torn) Do you understand me?"
43610,Bonnie, (chanting) Sangiema meam et nos mundo carcerema. Sangiema meam et nos mundo carcerema.
43611,Elena, Damon!
43612,Kai, (shouts) Bonnie!
43613,Enzo, Nice negligée!
43614,Sarah," (laughs) Enzo. Hey. Um, did I call you last night? I have a text from you to meet up, but I don't remember ever seeing you."
43615,Enzo," Look, Sarah... It was a mistake bringing you into my life."
43616,Sarah," (confused) Then, why did you?"
43617,Enzo," (chuckles) Call it deep and obvious loneliness. (He sighs) Look, the truth is, you've been a pawn in a game that I've now lost interest in playing. But, you're no ordinary girl, Sarah Salvatore. You deserve better."
43618,Sarah, (puzzled) Sarah... Salvatore? Why would you call me that?
43619,Jo," Oh, boy. This is bad."
43620,Alaric, (rubs his eyes) What?
43621,Jo," (seriously) I'm marrying an idiot. (She roughly smacks him in the shoulder, and Alaric groans in pain) You could died today!"
43622,Alaric, As opposed to any other day?
43623,Jo," Eighteen years. That's how long I need you to be alive. Help me raise this baby. Then we can send him or her into the world, and you can run around with g*n, and vampires, and be an idiot. (Her voice becomes quiet) Okay?"
43624,Alaric, (smiles) Fine.
43625,Damon," (about the computer) Whole world runs on those things. The sooner you learn 'em, the better."
43626,Lily, Maybe you could teach me?
43627,Damon," (makes the bed) That's more Stefan's thing. But, he can give you a tutorial after you mother him back to sanity."
43628,Lily," (walks toward Damon) Stefan was right. The night of my funeral, an angel did visit him: me. (Damon looks at her in surprise) I had just turned, and... I wanted to see my boys. But, when I leaned down to whisper into Stefan's ear, the hunger surged. All I could hear was the pulse in his veins, all I could smell was the bl*od. So, I fled. For your sake. And, no matter how deeply you felt my absence, it is half as deep as I felt yours."
43629,Damon, (nods in understanding) Good to know. (He pauses for a moment) I'll let you get some sleep.
43630,Lily, Damon?
43631,Damon, (sighs) Yes?
43632,Lily," As much as I am looking forward to us getting to know each other again, I fear that I can't truly be myself until we retrieve the ones that I've left behind."
43633,Damon, Oh.
43634,Lily, When will we be going back?
43635,Damon," Soon, but don't worry, your prison world's not going anywhere."
43636,Kai, (panting) Where do they keep their food?
43637,Kai," (startled) Oh, crap! (Once Kai gets over his initial fright, he looks closer at the three men and three women sitting frozen at the table. He then makes the mistake of leaning close to the partially-awakened vampire at the end of the table and chuckles) Who the hell are... AHHHHH!"
43638,Damon, You better check the inventory of the bl*od cooler before Lily wakes up.
43639,Elena, (smiles and turns to face him) You have her eyes.
43640,Damon, You brought that back?
43641,Elena, (takes the photo back) It's the only baby picture of my boyfriend in existence! Of course I brought it back.
43642,Damon, (snatches the photo again) Give me that!
43643,Elena, I liked seeing that side of you today.
43644,Damon, (gives her a look) Disappointed and disillusioned? You see that every day.
43645,Elena, (puts her arms around Damon's neck and plays with his hair) A mother's son.
43646,Damon, She's just a means to get Stefan back.
43647,Elena," Look, I know that she's not the woman that you remember, but... give her some time!"
43648,Damon," You're lucky you're so adorable, because your eternal optimism is super annoying."
43649,Elena," Well, I happen to know from experience that it's never a waste of time to look for the good in someone."
43650,Damon, This woman left her kids to go be the den mother to a family of vampires. I think we're going to be looking for quite a while.
43651,Elena," Well, then it's a good thing we have forever!"
43652,Caroline, Ahhh. That wasn't terrible.
43653,Stefan, See? Control is overrated.
43654,Caroline, I don't even remember how we got back to my room. (She peeks under the sheet and realizes she's still naked) Where's my shirt?
43655,Stefan, It's... next to the girl we left bleeding out in the hallway.
43656,Caroline, You're right. Your way is much more fun.
43657,Damon," Oh hey, Bon-Bon."
43658,Bonnie, (sheepishly) Sorry. Awkward timing.
43659,Elena," No, no, no, no, it's fine. I, um, I actually have to go check in on Ric to see how things are going with Stefan and Caroline, so..."
43660,Damon, This better be good.
43661,Bonnie, I just wanted to thank you for helping me find closure today.
43662,Damon," (points upstairs) You know there's a crazy-lady up there who wants to open that prison world up more than anything, right?"
43663,Bonnie," (whispering) We're never going back there, right?"
43664,Damon, No! We're not!
43665,Bonnie," (turns off the faucet) Good. Because I have something for you. A gift from 1994. I was gonna give it to you yesterday, but then you acted like an ass and you didn't deserve it."
43666,Damon," (sighs) Well, I..."
43667,Damon, That's not what I think it is... is it?
43668,Bonnie," If it wasn't for your notes on the map of Nova Scotia, I would have never remembered there was magic on that island. There's a good chance that I wouldn't be here today. So, for my 1994 road trip, I got you a li'l something."
43669,Damon, The cure. The cure to vampirism.
43670,Bonnie," (smiles) I knew you were planning on getting it yourself, you had the whole route mapped down to the kilometer."
43671,Damon, (closes the box) Why are you giving me this?
43672,Bonnie," Because my mom's surprisingly happy as a vampire, and because I have full faith that we'll get Caroline back to normal the old-fashioned way. But mostly, because I knew you wanted it for Elena."
43673,Damon, (stunned) What if I don't want it for her now?
43674,Bonnie," That's none of my business. I'm just finishing what you started. You can give it to her, or not. (She places her hand on top of Damon's affectionately) It's up to you."
43675,Caroline," If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life, all he has to do is shut his humanity off."
43676,Damon, Stefan without his humanity is one artery away from Stefan the ripper.
43677,Elena, Your mother is alive?
43678,Damon, In a prison world of 1903.
43679,Lily, (confused) And you believe that I can reconnect Stefan with his humanity?
43680,Damon, (smacks the table and stands up) Pack your bags.
43681,Lily," (stands up as well) Wonderful! (She laughs in excitement) I'll alert the others, hmm?"
43682,Damon, She has a vampire dollhouse.
43683,Damon, They're not coming.
43684,Lily, They are my family.
43685,Damon, I will leave you here to rot. We'll come back for them.
43686,Bonnie," (whispering) We're never going back there, right?"
43687,Damon, No! We're not!
43688,Enzo," You've been a pawn in a game that I've now lost interest in playing. You're no ordinary girl, Sarah Salvatore."
43689,Sarah, Why would you call me that?
43690,Bonnie, I have something for you.
43691,Damon, The cure to vampirism.
43692,Bonnie, I knew you wanted it for Elena.
43693,Damon, (stunned) What if I don't want it for her now?
43694,Bartender, (weirded out) OK...
43695,Bartender," (annoyed) Oh, come on. (He walks toward the bar) OK, who's messing with me? Chris, are you up there? (He pauses, but gets no answer) Dick."
43696,Bartender," (horrified) Oh, God. Chris? Chris?"
43697,Stefan, Boo.
43698,Caroline, (scoffs) Are you booing me?
43699,Stefan, Boo!
43700,Caroline," (indignant) I scared him. (She turns to the bartender) I scared you, right, with the whole chair flippy and the bottle thing?"
43701,Bartender, (scared) Who are you people?
43702,Caroline," Oh! I'm Caroline... (She gestures to Stefan, who waves to him) .. this is Stefan. (She points to Chris' body) And that... Mmm... was delicious. (She turns to Stefan) Taste."
43703,Stefan, (happily) Mmm.
43704,Bartender, ...What's going on?
43705,Stefan," Well, Caroline and I had a little bet that she would scare you to death."
43706,Caroline," (interrupts him) Like, literally scare you to death."
43707,Stefan," But you have to understand this is her first time messing with somebody, so she didn't realize the whole dead body shock-drop thing is a complete cliche."
43708,Bartender, (angrily) Cliche? This guy was my friend.
43709,Caroline," Well, then why aren't you freaking out, a panic attack, heart attack? Come on, give me something."
43710,Caroline, (compels him) I don't think you heard me. You're having a heart attack.
43711,Bartender, (scoffs) What are you... (He starts to groan and cough painfully) My... my chest. What's happening?
43712,Stefan, (drolly) She's cheating. That's what's happening.
43713,Bartender, (gasps) Ugh. Please help me.
43714,Stefan, (sighs) All right. Just relax. It's mental. You only think you're having a heart attack.
43715,Caroline, (mockingly) Now your throat's tightening. (She grabs her own throat and fake coughs as the bartender grabs his throat and gags) You can't breathe.
43716,Caroline," Oh, my God! Are those spiders all over your body?"
43717,Caroline, (happily) Hmm. Look at that. I won. Poor guy was so scared that he died of a heart attack.
43718,Stefan," (indignant) No, that's not fair. Technically, he died of a loophole."
43719,Caroline," A win is a win. So, you know what we do now?"
43720,Stefan," (sighs and grumbles) Yes, unfortunately I do. Karaoke."
43721,Sarah," So you drag me out of a hospital bed, waste a t*nk of gas driving around all night just to bring me to a house in the middle of nowhere?"
43722,Enzo," (sighs) As soon as this door opens, you are not my problem anymore."
43723,Sarah, When have I ever been your problem?
43724,Enzo, Since your great-great-great uncle Stefan nearly got you k*ll.
43725,Sarah, (confused) What?
43726,Enzo, It's time for you to meet your real family.
43727,Lily, Hello? Are you looking for my son?
43728,Enzo, (gulps nervously) My mistake.
43729,Lily," I'm sorry, have... have we..."
43730,Enzo, (quickly cuts her off) I've got the wrong house. Heh. Terribly sorry to disturb you.
43731,Sarah, What the hell was that?
43732,Enzo," I've met that woman before, in 1903."
43733,Sarah, (incredulously) What?!
43734,Enzo, She's the one who turned me into a vampire.
43735,Elena, Do you smell something?
43736,Damon, (inhales) Hmm. Mom's cooking.
43737,Elena, Is that bacon?
43738,Damon," Yeah, or some baby she abducted from a nearby village."
43739,Elena," (giggles) Hey. Shh, she can hear us. You have to give her a chance, just like I gave you one. She's your mother."
43740,Damon," No, she is a tool to get Stefan's humanity back, because there is no doubt that he and Caroline are fangs-deep in bodies right now. So, the sooner we get our supernatural-born k*ll out of circulation, the better."
43741,Elena, Have you seen my t-shirt?
43742,Damon, (smirks) I prefer you without one.
43743,Elena, I'm not so sure your mom would feel the same way.
43744,Damon, (shrugs) Take mine.
43745,Elena, Wow!
43746,Lily (to Elena)," (smiles) This was always Damon's favorite... ""Eggie in baskie."""
43747,Damon (to Lily), (takes a bite) Doesn't taste like I remember.
43748,Lily (to Damon)," Well, you were human the last time you tasted it. Our tastes change over time. But, Elena, you're fairly new at this, aren't you?"
43749,Elena, (nods) I turned a few years ago.
43750,Lily," You ever miss it, being human?"
43751,Elena, (shrugs) Sometimes.
43752,Lily," So if I understood correctly, um, in order to free my companions from that place where I was trapped, we'll need the magical device."
43753,Damon, The Ascendant.
43754,Lily, Yes. The Ascendant. Where is that?
43755,Damon, (awkwardly) Safe. Very safe.
43756,Lily, And we'll also need a celestial event.
43757,Damon," We'll have to do some digging, yeah. Be patient, they take time. They're very rare."
43758,Lily," There's a full moon coming up. Will that work? If not, the Lyrids meteor shower is in two weeks."
43759,Damon," (sarcastically) Well, look at you. If you're not a one-woman ""Farmer's Almanac""."
43760,Lily," Actually, I took your advice, and I've been dabbling on Stefan's computer. What a wondrous invention... All that knowledge."
43761,Damon, And videos of cats riding robot vacuum cleaners.
43762,Damon, (concerned) Everything OK?
43763,Elena, It's Jo. Someone's been attacking people at Whitmore.
43764,Damon," (sighs) Let me guess... One of them's blond, and the other one liked turning people into human pez dispensers."
43765,Elena, That's exactly what I'm gonna find out. (She stands and turns to Lily with an apologetic smile) Thank you so much for breakfast.
43766,Sarah," Who is that woman, and how do you even know who my family is? How do I not know this?"
43767,Enzo," Because your uncle Stefan compelled you to forget to keep you a secret from your other uncle, Damon, after he k*ll your parents, and you would have shared their fate had it not been for your other uncle."
43768,Sarah, (horrified) That's who you were taking me to?
43769,Enzo," Well, actually, no. The good brother recently went bad, and I was hoping to leave you in the care of the bad brother, who actually is less bad now than the good brother."
43770,Sarah, (stunned) I don't understand any of this.
43771,Enzo," Yeah. Look. I can try repeating it, luv, but it won't be any clearer the second time. (Sarah sighs, clearly overwhelmed, and looks out the passenger window) Look. You wanted to know who that woman is? She's the most dreadful person I've ever met."
43772,Dockworker, Unh! No sick passengers!
43773,Enzo, I have a ticket. I've paid.
43774,Dockworker," (takes the ticket and rips it up) Oh, yeah? Well, we're not running a sick ward."
43775,Enzo, (coughing and gasping) There's a doctor on that ship. He can help me.
43776,Dockworker," (sneers) Get lost, mate, before you infect us all with your consumption."
43777,Enzo, (frightened) Who are you?
43778,Lily, Someone who sees you need a doctor.
43779,Enzo," (laughs defeatedly) Well, I... I appreciate that, but even if I could get past quarantine, I seem to have lost my ticket."
43780,Lily, I can be of some help with that. Come. We don't have much time.
43781,Enzo (V.O.)," I thought I was on my way to a new life, aided by the classiest woman I'd ever met. By the time the ship docked in New York harbor, every soul on board was dead, including me."
43782,Enzo," (compels her) You're going to forget everything you know about your real family. You're going to wake up safe in your dorm, having forgotten you ever heard the name Salvatore."
43783,Sarah, Or you're finally gonna tell me the whole story.
43784,Enzo, (sighs in annoyance) You're on vervain.
43785,Sarah, Yeah. Your friend Matt stopped by the hospital and gave me some.
43786,Enzo, Unh.
43787,Caroline,"

43788,Female student," Hey, Taylor Swift. We're trying to study here. (Caroline smiles and wags her finger at the girl, who scoffs) Where's the manager in this place?"
43789,Stefan, Someone ask for the manager?
43790,Tyler, (indignant) I didn't break his ribs. He got the wind knocked out of him.
43791,Matt, Guy was out for 20 seconds.
43792,Tyler, (shrugs) Maybe he's not cut out for a tactical training program. We're not there to bust up keggers.
43793,Matt, (laughs) You want some food?
43794,Tyler," (corrects him) You want some food, ""Officer Lockwood""?"
43795,Matt, (shakes his head) Dork.
43796,Caroline,"

43797,Tyler, (warily) What did we just walk into?
43798,Stefan," Oh, look. It's the police officers in training. Are you guys here to arrest us? (He points the kn*fe at the girl and compels her) You can go away now."
43799,Tyler, (horrified) What the hell are you doing?
43800,Stefan, I'm just enjoying the music. You guys want next song?
43801,Matt, We should get out of here.
43802,Stefan, No. Stay. Caroline's taking requests.
43803,Damon, Here. Text Elena. Tell her we're headed to campus to check it out. (Lily looks at him in confusion) See those letters? Think of it as a tiny typewriter.
43804,Lily, Oh. You're right.
43805,Damon, Mm-hmm.
43806,Lily," ""My Dearest Elena, I hope this finds you well..."""
43807,Damon," No, no. Short and sweet. Just ""Headed to campus."" (Lily gives him a puzzled look) Yeah. Then, when we find them, I'll take care of Caroline, you look Stefan right in the eyes..."
43808,Lily, (narrates as she types) And I will return him to the man he used to be.
43809,Damon, Exactly.
43810,Lily," And once we've done that, then we will go rescue my friends?"
43811,Damon, Sure. I know how terribly concerned you are about that.
43812,Lily," (continues typing) How shall I end it? With an, ""I love you?"""
43813,Damon, Knock yourself out.
43814,Lily," You do love her, don't you?"
43815,Damon," Not that that's any of your business, but, yes, I do. And she loves me. We're in the love."
43816,Lily," (quietly) And you're afraid you'll ruin all that if you give her the cure. (Damon gives her a shocked look) Last night, when your friend Bonnie was over..."
43817,Damon, You spied on me?
43818,Lily," Well, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I'm just not used to hearing other voices. I..."
43819,Damon, (exasperated) Really?
43820,Lily," Couldn't help but listen, and it's not every day that one hears something so rare as the cure for vampirism."
43821,Damon," (grimaces) Well, let's not bring this up to anyone else, OK?"
43822,Lily," You mean, don't bring it up with Elena."
43823,Damon, I don't even know if she wants the cure.
43824,Lily," Yet you fear she might and that if you give it to her you'll lose her. (Damon sh**t her another look) We're more alike than you care to admit, Damon. Neither of us can bear the thought of being alone."
43825,Elena," He's unconscious, but I gave him some of my bl*od, and his vitals have stabilized."
43826,Jo," (worried) The more these v*ctim pile up, the harder it is to hide the reason they're here."
43827,Elena," Yeah, I know. That's why I'm hoping that Damon and his mom find them soon."
43828,Jo, (confused) I'm sorry. Did you just say Damon's mom? Isn't she dead?
43829,Elena," (slowly) No. She was trapped in a 1903 prison world, where Kai is currently trapped."
43830,Jo, (stunned) Kai is in a 1903 prison world?
43831,Elena, (guiltily) I'm sorry. Has nobody told you this?
43832,Jo, I'm on hour 13 of a 12-hour shift. Maybe someone could have sh*t me a text?
43833,Elena, (even more guilty) I'm... sorry.
43834,Jo," So, Kai's gone?"
43835,Elena, (smiles) As in for good.
43836,Jo," Oh, that's amazing news. Like, really amazing news."
43837,Elena, (shocked) You're pregnant.
43838,Elena," (smiles) I was wondering why you switched to decaf, especially while working a 13-hour shift."
43839,Jo, The last thing this baby needs is an uncle Psychopath.
43840,Elena," You and Alaric are having a baby. I... (Jo laughs excitedly again, and Elena pulls her into a hug) Jo, this is... this is amazing. I... I'm so happy for you!"
43841,Enzo, (impressed) Little old you did all this? (He sighs) You've made a mistake.
43842,Sarah," I know, starting with trusting my vampire stalker, who arranged for me to befriend some blue-eyed bartender, all so I could witness him getting run over, and you playing the part of the hero. (Enzo looks surprised) While you were sleeping, I went through your phone, saw your texts to Matt."
43843,Enzo," Well, that saves me an awkward conversation."
43844,Sarah, (unamused) I am such an idiot for ever trusting you.
43845,Enzo, Don't b*at yourself up. I remember what it was like to be so naive.
43846,Doctor," The bacilli have spread to most of your lungs, carving out cavities in the tissue. The bleeding will continue."
43847,Enzo, (weakly) You can stop it?
43848,Doctor," I believe so, but the dosage required at this late stage is expensive."
43849,Lily," Payment isn't an issue, provided your curative is effective."
43850,Doctor, I can assure you it is.
43851,Lily, (compels him) How many people have you saved with this? Be truthful.
43852,Doctor, (dazed) None. I promise them health and sell them lavender mixed with castor oil.
43853,Enzo, What? Why are you saying that? I thought you could help me.
43854,Lily, (unhappily) He lied. (She compels the doctor again) What is this man's true prognosis?
43855,Doctor," He'll die within the week. Chances are, he'll never see land again."
43856,Lily, (furious) Leave us.
43857,Enzo, You should go as well. I do not wish to repay your acts of kindness by affecting you.
43858,Lily, You can't. I've already had consumption.
43859,Enzo, (confused) How did you survive?
43860,Lily, I didn't.
43861,Enzo," What are you, an angel?"
43862,Caroline, Ha ha ha!
43863,Tyler," (annoyed) Look. We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands. Can we go now?"
43864,Caroline, Let's play Caroline Trivia.
43865,Tyler, I don't even know what that is.
43866,Caroline," Oh, sure you do! You both dated me, which means you should know everything about me, so I'm gonna ask you some questions about myself, and whoever answers them right lives."
43867,Matt, You're sick.
43868,Caroline, (ignores him) When is my birthday? Tyler!
43869,Tyler, (sighs) October 10.
43870,Caroline," Very good. Alright, Matt. Your turn. What is my favorite color?"
43871,Matt, That's a trick question. You don't have a favorite color.
43872,Caroline," (laughs) Correct! Ha ha ha! OK, now a tiebreaker. Whoever answers first wins. What was my mom's final memory before she died?"
43873,Tyler, (frustrated) How would we even begin to know that?
43874,Caroline," Oh, I'm sure I mentioned it at some point."
43875,Matt," No, you didn't."
43876,Caroline," (shrugs) Come on. Ticktock, ticktock. Judges are waiting for a final answer. What was my mom's final memory before she kicked the bucket?"
43877,Stefan," Well, looks like, uh, Whitmore's gonna need a new philosophy T.A. (He looks over at Caroline) Hmm. Your mom was teaching you how to ride a bike."
43878,Caroline," (excitedly) Bingo! And Stefan wins, which means you two lose, which isn't that bad actually because now it just means we get to k*ll the both of you."
43879,Jo," Judging from the v*ctim, they started at the library, they took out a couple security guards near the football field, and then they wandered over to the movie theater."
43880,Elena, (exasperated) You know what the most shocking part of all this is? I'm not shocked.
43881,Jo, Doctor 101... Becoming desensitized goes with the territory.
43882,Elena," Actually, the reason why I'm not shocked is because I've been in their shoes, and I was just as bad, and this is all just one big horrible reminder that there's always gonna be a part of me that's capable of doing what they're doing."
43883,Jo, (sympathetically) But you're not gonna let that happen. You're gonna be too busy running your small-town family practice and curing little Stevie from the chicken pox.
43884,Elena, For a while maybe until little Stevie becomes teenage Steven and I haven't aged a day.
43885,Jo, Have you told Damon about this?
43886,Elena, (confused) What do you mean?
43887,Jo, I saw how you reacted when you found out I was pregnant.
43888,Elena," (embarrassed) Well, I..."
43889,Jo," (cuts her off) And the next eternity of your life flashed before your eyes, and it scared the hell out of you."
43890,Elena, I... I'm just happy for you and Alaric.
43891,Jo," Alaric, who used to be a vampire, now is a human having a kid. Have you discussed this with your boyfriend?"
43892,Elena," He knows how I feel, but he also knows that there's nothing we can do to change that, so there's no point in dwelling."
43893,Jo, OK.
43894,Sarah," So how do I know you're not the one who's been mind-controlling me, making me believe this messed up family history?"
43895,Enzo," You were ripped from the womb of a dead woman. Stefan compelled away the truth, but the emotional scars still linger. How else do you explain your morbid fascinations, hmm? (He looks around her room at all the different artwork hanging on her walls) The... the hanging of Mary Surratt... heh... is hardly a motivational poster, now is it?"
43896,Sarah," Yeah. Well, there's mething about death that I find... I don't know..."
43897,Enzo," (finishes her sentence) Alluring? Well, let me tell you, you can't truly appreciate death until you've stood at its precipice."
43898,Enzo, I haven't heard that song since I was a boy.
43899,Lily, (smiles) I know.
43900,Enzo, Why are you doing this?
43901,Lily, Is it so hard to believe someone could do you a kindness?
43902,Enzo, I was abandoned at a workhouse at the age of 4. It was not a place known for its kindness.
43903,Lily," I, too, know what it is to be tossed aside like rubbish. I was sent to a sanatorium to rot, left to die, abandoned by my own husband, who prayed the end would come quickly not so that I would be spared pain and misery but so that he would be unburdened by me, but I was given a reprieve, and it was only once I was unshackled from a life that didn't want me that I found my true family."
43904,Enzo," Is that where you're heading, to meet them?"
43905,Lily," (smiles) No. I could never bear to be apart from them. They're here, traveling with me. Like you and I, they're outcasts. You could join us. You'd never be alone again."
43906,Enzo, It would appear the end is coming.
43907,Lily, (smiles comfortingly) Or the beginning.
43908,Lily," Drink this, Lorenzo."
43909,Lily," If your brother's on the hunt, he won't be staying in one place."
43910,Damon," Yeah? Well, we have to start somewhere. Elena said she treated some kid who was attacked coming out of modern European history. (He pauses for a moment when he receives a text message from Elena to update him on what she knows) Well, well. Mother knows best. Elena said they're at Scull Bar. Come on."
43911,Lily, (anxiously) We have yet to discuss what we'll do if Stefan fails to remember me.
43912,Damon," (confused) What, are you kidding? You're his mother. Of course he's gonna remember you. (He stops and looks her in the eye) Tell me you can do this."
43913,Lily, What if I say the wrong thing? A century and a half is a long time to be away.
43914,Damon," You'll be fine. (He starts to walk away toward the bar, and Lily follows behind him) Just channel whatever you were feeling when you came back to get us."
43915,Lily, (puzzled) When I came back to get you?
43916,Damon," Yeah. 1903. You found out we were vampires, you landed in New York harbor after a 40-year romp in Europe, and you..."
43917,Damon, Oh. You weren't coming to get us.
43918,Lily, (embarrassed) No. I wasn't. I'm sorry.
43919,Damon, You can do this. All we have to do is just try.
43920,Lily," I have been trying, Damon. Since I laid my eyes on you yesterday, I have been trying with all of my heart to reconnect with the woman who was your mother, to remember what it felt like to mourn you and your brother after I was banished by your father. After I was turned, the only thing more powerful than the longing I felt for you was the fear of what I would I do if I ever saw you again. So I stayed away. I had to find others who could help me find my way back myself, and... By the time my new family helped me to do that, everything I felt for my old family, for you and your brother was gone. I hate that I can't make myself feel more. I'm so sorry."
43921,Caroline," (to Stefan) Heads, I k*ll Tyler, and tails, I k*ll Matt. Deal?"
43922,Stefan, Sounds good to me.
43923,Stefan, Ooh! Looks like somebody's angry.
43924,Caroline, (rolls her eyes) He's a wolf. It's his resting face.
43925,Tyler," You wonder why everyone hates vampires? Look at you, messing with people for no reason. That's really brave."
43926,Matt, What are you doing?
43927,Stefan, (laughs) Are you serious?
43928,Tyler," (aggressively) What's wrong, Stefan? Not used to people fighting back?"
43929,Stefan," No, actually, I'm just not used to people being this stupid."
43930,Matt," Alright, Ty, stop. He will k*ll you. (He turns to Stefan) Stefan, he's sorry."
43931,Caroline," (laughs mockingly and walks over to Tyler) Ha ha! See that little vein in his forehead? I used to think it was so sexy, but now I'm pretty sure it's just all the bl*od leaving his brain."
43932,Tyler," (sneers) Screw you, Caroline."
43933,Tyler," Come on. Either of you, come at me."
43934,Matt," Ty, stop!"
43935,Stefan," Hey, Caroline. I will gladly k*ll him for you, but I know what a jerk he was during your relationship, so if you want..."
43936,Caroline," (stares at Tyler and smiles) I want. Come on, Tyler. I dare you."
43937,Matt," (anxiously) Ty, stop. She will k*ll you."
43938,Tyler," Get out of here, Matt."
43939,Caroline," Nice going, Tyler."
43940,Elena, (in disbelief) She flat-out told you that she didn't love you?
43941,Damon," Well, she was her overly proper self, but, yeah, that was the gist of it, but, hey, you know, I'm not planning on honoring my end of the plan by jail-breaking her friends, so... tch... figure we're even."
43942,Elena, (rolls her eyes) Damon.
43943,Damon," Nah, it's fine. 150 years is a long time to care."
43944,Elena, Says the guy who pined for Katherine Pierce for over a century and a half.
43945,Damon, (chuckles) Heh.
43946,Elena," It's OK to feel hurt, Damon. She was the second woman to abandon you."
43947,Damon," (smiles) Says the woman who never has. Look, you can sit here and flirt with me, or you can help me come up with a ""plan B"", because Lily's a no-go."
43948,Elena, (thinks for a moment) Stefan doesn't know how she feels...
43949,Damon, Stefan's also not a moron.
43950,Elena, (hopefully) Any chance your mom's a good liar?
43951,Damon, Where the hell are you going?
43952,Lily, (upset) Anywhere. I don't know. Let me be.
43953,Damon," (annoyed) No. Now you listen. Hey! I have one solution to this, and it's you, so you're gonna walk over to that bar, and you're gonna give the performance of your lifetime, or you can kiss your desiccated vampire family good-bye. Understood?"
43954,Lily, What if I fail to bring him back?
43955,Damon, You won't fail.
43956,Lily, I need to be assured that regardless of the outcome with your brother today I can trust you to help me get my people back.
43957,Damon, (frustrated) I told you a hundred times we'll get them back.
43958,Lily, (suspiciously) And is that the truth?
43959,Damon, Why would I lie?
43960,Lily," Damon. You have the power to give your greatest love the human life she desires, and you have yet to be truthful with her."
43961,Damon, (stares at Lily) Showtime.
43962,Caroline," So for those of us keeping score, if Matt dies, are you gonna start peeing on fire hydrants again?"
43963,Caroline, Who's that?
43964,Stefan, It's my mother.
43965,Tyler," Come here, man."
43966,"Damon, voice-over", Then tell him that you wish you could have seen him grow up.
43967,Lily," Your angel has returned to you, and I will never leave you again."
43968,Damon," You get a night, Stefan, a night to b*at yourself up, do your shame spiral, and then you have to go after Caroline."
43969,Stefan, I don't need a night. I'll find her.
43970,Matt," Do you know how many times I've died or nearly died? Most of those times were at the hands of people I thought were my friends. I'm sorry, not people... Vampires."
43971,Damon," Well, Matt lives to hate vampires another day, Stefan's on Caroline duty, and I just introduced mom to uber. Taking bets on which one goes south first."
43972,Jo, It doesn't matter.
43973,Jo," Before the 1900s, your mother fell in with a group of witches that were cast out of the Gemini coven."
43974,Damon, The cure to vampirism.
43975,Bonnie, I knew you wanted it for Elena.
43976,Damon, What if I don't want it for her now?
43977,Caroline," If anyone tries to flip my humanity switch back on, I'll become your worst nightmare."
43978,Matt," Ty, stop!"
43979,Damon," Hello, mother."
43980,Lily, You believe that I can reconnect Stefan with his humanity.
43981,Jo," They were known as heretics, vampires with witch power."
43982,Enzo, That woman made me a monster and then abandoned me.
43983,Caroline, Who's that?
43984,Damon, You have to go after Caroline.
43985,"Stefan, voice-over", First step... convince her that my humanity is still off.
43986,Stefan, Torture her until she breaks.
43987,Elena, So do I need to remind you two that the last time Caroline thought that we were trying to flip her switch she went on a k*ll spree?
43988,Stefan," Well, she's not gonna find out this time."
43989,Damon, See? He'll be convincing.
43990,Elena, How do you know she's gonna even want to see you again?
43991,Elena, Did you and Caroline...
43992,Damon, Do it? Yep.
43993,Caroline, Such a gentleman.
43994,Jo, Oh. Did I tell you? I got us into that cute bakery right off campus.
43995,Alaric, I have no idea what you're talking about.
43996,Jo, To taste wedding cake for our wedding.
43997,Alaric, Oh.
43998,Jo, I don't need to remind you. Right around the corner.
43999,Alaric, Is this where I pretend to care about how our wedding cake tastes?
44000,Jo, I just pulled a rummy all-nighter at a B&B we're supposed to be scouting for the wedding. You can care about cake. Did I mention that the cute bakery is right next door to an even cuter Tequila bar?
44001,Alaric, Mmm. Tequila. My favorite. Gin. Again. How many is that?
44002,Elena," Oh! Um, ahem."
44003,Alaric, Elena! Hey.
44004,Jo, We were just keeping a really close eye on your friends.
44005,Alaric, Yeah. Real close.
44006,Elena, Yeah. I can see that.
44007,Alaric, Yeah.
44008,Elena, Good news! Your shift's over. I'm here to relieve you.
44009,Jo," In that case, I'm just gonna head to the honeymoon suite."
44010,Elena," Knock, knock."
44011,Stefan," Sorry, Elena, but if you want us back, you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that."
44012,Bonnie," Hey, Matt."
44013,Elena," Well, at least Alaric and Jo can cross this off their list of honeymoon options."
44014,Damon, They have a list?
44015,Elena, Mm-hmm. Jo's pregnant. They didn't want to have to fly anywhere?
44016,Damon, Do you have a list?
44017,Elena, Of where I'd go on my fictional honeymoon before I give birth to my fictional baby? No. But not here.
44018,Damon, I thought you liked this place.
44019,Elena, Really? What part of extreme floral patterns screams Elena Gilbert to you? 
44020,Damon," Well, excuse me, missy. I guess we've never played the let's pretend we're human fantasy game together. All right. Let's play. You're human. 5 years from now, where are you?"
44021,Elena, Easy. With you.
44022,Damon, Boring. I'll need a zip code.
44023,Elena," Ok. Uh, in a loft in Tribeca above the bar that you work at."
44024,Damon, You made me Matt Donovan in your fantasy?
44025,Elena," Ok. You... you own the bar, and when you're not working there, you're... you're on our couch, pouring me wine and massaging my feet after a long day at the O.R. I'm in the surgical residency program."
44026,Damon, Of course you are. Kids?
44027,Elena," Yeah, of course, eventually, but we should, um, probably have two, you know, so they can keep each other company when we're, you know, distracted by other things."
44028,Damon," Hmm. You got it all figured out, don't you?"
44029,Caroline, Ugh! This is torture!
44030,Caroline, That would have been me.
44031,Caroline, Why are you only picking on me?
44032,Lily, So kind of you to bring me home.
44033,Enzo, You've got a lot to learn about your son.
44034,Caroline, You're not real. You can't be real.
44035,Liz, Ok.
44036,Caroline," Wait, wait."
44037,Elena, Damon!
44038,Elena, Kai is trapped in a 1903 prison world.
44039,Jo," Before the 1900s, Lily fell in with a group of witches that were cast out of the Gemini coven."
44040,Enzo, You turned me and left me on a passenger ship full of headless corpses.
44041,Lily," No. The night I turned you, my friends and I were captured by the Gemini coven."
44042,Elena," If I was human, we wouldn't work."
44043,Lily, The cure to vampirism.
44044,Elena and Bonnie, Surprise!
44045,Elena, Understandable.
44046,Jo, Considering...
44047,Caroline on voicemail," Hey! It's Caroline, but, duh, you knew that because you called, so leave a message, and I'll call you back."
44048,Damon," Where are you, and please tell me you're with the stripper."
44049,"Elena, voice-over"," Let me guess... you got a lap dance, and now you feel guilty."
44050,Damon, How'd you know?
44051,Elena, I love it up here.
44052,Damon, What's your favorite thing about being a vampire?
44053,Elena, It all looks so good.
44054,Damon, So what looks good?
44055,Stefan," Damon, do not take that cure."
44056,Lily, Elena!
44057,Elena on cell phone, I got to the tunnels.
44058,"Elena, voice-over", You walked away from me because you didn't want me to change your mind because you don't want this.
44059,Lily, Hello?
44060,Stefan, That's not gonna happen.
44061,Kai, Big breakfast for a big day!
44062,Stefan," If my life is gonna fall apart when my humanity starts flooding back, then so is yours."
44063,Jo," Before the 1900s, Lily fell in with a group of witches that were cast out of the Gemini coven."
44064,Lily, Now...
44065,Caroline," To be honest, I think maybe this is a good thing, because no matter how good Danielle was, I am pretty sure I'm better."
44066,Tyler," To Alaric Saltzman, who after today, will have sex with only one woman for the rest of his life."
44067,Both, Courtesy of Caroline.
44068,Damon," ""Sure, I'll be your best man, Ric, but first, hang out with the worst men so that my brother can kidnap me on the day of your wedding."""
44069,Lily, I want my family back.
44070,Matt, Ok. Truck's here. Who's coming?
44071,Caroline," No, not there. There."
44072,Liv," Honestly, you should probably do that yourself."
44073,Jo, Hey.
44074,Elena, Heh!
44075,Woman on TV, I just love to serve watermelon.
44076,Lily," Tea, please. Earl Grey."
44077,Alaric, Don't worry. I'm not.
44078,Mr. Parker," Maybe I should just, uh, leave my gift and go then."
44079,Caroline, Where the hell are you?
44080,Stefan," Uh, hey. Look. I don't want to tell you how to run your wedding, but..."
44081,Reverend," Welcome, family and friends, on this magical evening to the wedding of Alaric Saltzman and Josette Laughlin."
44082,Alaric, Neither one of us should be here right now.
44083,Reverend, Josette?
44084,Jo," Before the 1900s, Lily fell in with a group of witches that were cast out of the Gemini coven..."
44085,Reverend, Welcome to the wedding of Alaric Salzman and Josette Laughlin.
44086,Damon, Elena!
44087,Liv," Oh, Tyler!"
44088,Matt, Ty?
44089,Bonnie, You need more than bl*od.
44090,Damon, Just dance with me.
44091,Kai, How dumb are you?
44092,Bonnie, Damon.
44093,Caroline, We just take her hand...
44094,"Elena, voice-over"," You're gonna think that the pain will never end, but it will, but first, you have to let it all in."
44095,Jeremy, Alaric.
44096,Tyler, So where are we in this vision of yours?
44097,Stefan," Yesterday, you told me you made a list of all the ways that loving me has ruined your life, and I get it."
44098,Reverend, Welcome to the wedding of Alaric Saltzman and Josette Laughlin.
44099,Kai, Miss me?
44100,Damon, Stefan! She won't wake up.
44101,Kai," So, Bonster, I linked Elena's life to yours. As long as you're alive, Elena will remain asleep."
44102,Pastor, We are here today to pay our respect to sheriff Elizabeth Forbes.
44103,Caroline," You and I, I can't do this right now. I'm sorry."
44104,Stefan," I understand if you need time to heal, and if I have to wait for you, I will."
44105,Caroline, Who's that?
44106,Jo," Before the 1900s, Lily fell in with a group of witches that were cast out of the Gemini coven."
44107,Lily," Lorenzo, it's our family."
44108,Damon, It's time for me to say good-bye.
44109,Stefan, Damon... wake up. I need you. Wake up.
44110,Stefan, Damon... Wake the hell up!

44112,Caroline (V.O.)," ""Dear Elena... A few weeks ago, you said good-bye and told us to write everything down so you'd feel like you didn't miss anything when you woke up. Bad news first. Damon said the best way to keep his mind off you was to help Alaric grieve, so in Damon fashion, he kidnapped Ric and flew him to Europe for a guy get-away. I'm sure you can imagine how that's going."""
44113,Caroline (V.O.)," ""Obviously, we didn't send them there without a chaperone."""
44114,Bonnie, Drinken now.
44115,Caroline (V.O.)," ""So Damon's watching out for Alaric, Bonnie's watching out for Damon, and I don't know exactly who's watching out for Bonnie. Matt will officially be deputy Donovan next week when he graduates. As happy as I am for him, a big part of me wishes my mom was here to see it. The town council gave her a bench. I've been visiting it, hoping I'll miraculously start missing her less. Oh. I keep thinking that if I can heal I can move on with my life, but I don't see that happening anytime soon."""
44116,Caroline (V.O.)," ""Anyway, I covered Damon, Bonnie, Ric, Matt. Who am I missing?"""
44117,Stefan, What you writing?
44118,Caroline, Stefan. What are you doing here?
44119,Stefan," Matt reported some bl*od bags missing from the hospital, so I thought I'd check it out."
44120,Caroline, Do you think it's your mom?
44121,Stefan," If it's not, then she has quite literally dropped off the face of the earth, and I'm still deciding if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
44122,Caroline, So... how's Damon?
44123,Stefan," Well, if the last time he sat around waiting decades for a girl taught us anything, then I am worried."
44124,Caroline," Well, if you're worried, then I'm terrified."
44125,Stefan," I made this, uh, a thing, didn't I?"
44126,Caroline, You made what a thing?
44127,Stefan," I told you how I felt about you, and now it's... It's weird."
44128,Caroline," No. It's not weird, Stefan."
44129,Stefan," You just asked about my brother, who you hate, to fill awkward silence."
44130,Caroline," Ok. I don't hate Damon. I'm just... Obviously, you know, scrambling to fill the awkward silence. Ok. It's a thing. You made it a thing. Congratulations."
44131,Stefan," All right. How about this? New rule... You live your life, you heal, and in the meantime, we're friends."
44132,Caroline, I like that rule.
44133,Stefan, Good. Ok. Happy writing.
44134,Caroline, Thank you.

The food is literally made of poison, the air smells like a plague, and everyone wants to know what everyone else is doing. I don't fit in here, nor do I want to. This is not the world I imagined."""
44137,Stu's girlfriend," Oh, my God! Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. What did you do?"
44138,Stu, I didn't think she'd walk right into the street.
44139,Stu's girlfriend," Stu, Stu, we have to call 911."
44140,Stu," Shut up, ok? Let me think."
44141,Stu," Ok. It's not like anyone saw us, right?"
44142,Stu's girlfriend, Are you insane? We can't just leave her here. She's not moving!
44143,Stu," We just smoked a joint, ok? I'm high as a freaking kite right now. Do you want me to go to jail?"
44144,Stu, Let's go.
44145,Valerie (V.O.)," ""As I was saying, complete and utter hell. Not that my family is making it any easier. Lily sequestered us away in some musty, abandoned house. Stoic Beau, Nora the brat, the devious mental Mary Louise, and Malcolm, Lily's pet."""

44147,Valerie (V.O.)," ""The brown noser."""
44148,Nora," What a s'aint you are, Malcolm."
44149,Nora, Ah. This is ludicrous.
44150,Mary Louise, Nora's right. How long are we to live on 3 sips a day? It's that prison world all over again.
44151,Lily, Beau is not complaining.
44152,Mary Louise, Beau's mute.
44153,Malcolm," And here we thought we could have a family meal in peace. Beau, care to join me for a game of backgammon while the love birds bicker?"
44154,Alaric, I can't feel my cheeks. What are we drinking?
44155,Damon, No idea.
44156,Damon, Can you read German?
44157,Alaric," That's, uh, actually Dutch."
44158,Damon, Oh. Wait. Where are we?
44159,Bonnie, Amsterdam.
44160,Bonnie (V.O.)," ""Dear Elena, yep, halfway across Europe, and they're still drunk."""
44161,Damon, Is that really necessary?
44162,Bonnie," Elena told me to keep a journal of everything she's missing. When she wakes up in 60-some years and finds out that Ric died from alcohol poisoning, she's gonna want to know what happened."
44163,Damon, Unless you tragically choke to death on those cocktail peanuts. Then I can tell her myself.
44164,Bonnie, Oh. So sweet.
44165,Bonnie, I'm gonna go rent a bike and see the city like a normal tourist.
44166,Damon, FYI. They don't wear helmets here.
44167,Bonnie, Keeps getting funnier.
44168,Damon," Hey. Ride in the tram tracks, don't look both ways."
44169,Bonnie, Got it.
44170,Alaric, Heh heh. Are you sure you don't want to go with her?
44171,Damon, Nice try. I'm not leaving you.
44172,Alaric," I don't need a baby-sitter, Damon."
44173,Damon," This isn't about what you need, Ric. It's about what I need. Just keeping you from jumping off a cliff keeps my mind off of the fact that my girlfriend's magical coma is linked to a Bennett witch that has a knack for avoiding permanent death."
44174,Alaric, I see. So my misery is merely a convenient distraction for you?
44175,Damon, Yep.
44176,Alaric, Ok.
44177,Damon, What?
44178,Alaric," I'm glad you're here, buddy."
44179,Mary Louise, Heh. Ha ha ha!
44180,Damon," Reception went a little fuzzy, brother."
44181,Matt," One v*ctim had bite wounds, and the other one was scorched beyond recognition."
44182,Stefan," Matt found a house that's been in foreclosure for the last two years, and it had its power mysteriously turned back on just days after Ric's wedding, so Caroline is there staking it out."
44183,Enzo, It's a crime for the prettiest girl in the bar to sit alone.
44184,Caroline, There's 5 heretics...
44185,Valerie, It's a gargantuan hell hole.
44186,Matt," Hey, Caroline. We should really get going to that barbecue."
44187,Valerie, Does anyone else smell that?
44188,Sheriff, Please join me in recognizing our graduating class of new deputies as I read their names and they receive their badges.

44459,Damon," Julian makes her happy, Stefan. More time they spend together, the happier she gets, the more tragic it'll be in 6 months when I hand-deliver his heart to her."

44518,Nora, And why would I do that?
44519,Matt, Why would a group of vampires hang around an abandoned town with nothing to eat?
44520,Mary Louise, What are we talking about?
44521,Nora," Apparently, Matt is sick of us."
44522,Matt," I just want my town back, preferably before anyone else dies."
44523,Nora," Look around. Look at all these people. They're still alive, aren't they?"
44524,Mary Louise, At least till the dessert course.
44525,Nora, You're making it worse. Come on. Let's go meet people.
44526,Bonnie," Oh, did whatever animal they're serving for dinner get a plus-one?"
44527,Enzo, Hilarious. I was invited.
44528,Bonnie, You're scoping the competition.
44529,Enzo," There is not competition to scope. [Knocks on door] Since you're here, if anyone's wondering, you're my date."
44530,Bonnie, Sorry?
44531,Lily," Lorenzo, I'm so glad you came."
44532,Enzo, Wouldn't miss it.
44533,Lily," Bonnie, I know we've had a rocky past, but I hope this means you're willing to start fresh."
44534,Bonnie," You're the reason I'm never gonna see my best friend again, so I hope you're joking."
44535,Julian," Hmm, nice break."
44536,Stefan," Well, it is my pool table, after all."
44537,Julian," Ah, Damon, come play with us."
44538,Damon," Oh, I would, but I have an irrational fear of pool tables."
44539,Julian, It's not a rational fear of losing?
44540,Damon, Wait. Has he nev... Have you never heard the story about the guy that tries to k*ll the vampire during a game of pool?
44541,Julian," Huh. Well, considering my body's been in stasis for a century, why don't you enlighten me?"
44542,Damon," Well, there's this guy. He's about Stefan's build, maybe a wee bit bigger, little more chiseled, less height on the hair."
44543,Stefan, Get on with the story.
44544,Damon," Right, so this vampire that he wants to k*ll is at least 300 years older than him, and anyone and everyone with half a brain knew he was being an idiot, but he had this inexplicable obsession, so he bets the vampire in a game of pool, and just as the vamp is setting up for his last sh*t..."
44545,Julian, And?
44546,Damon, Never got a chance.
44547,Julian, Oh.
44548,Damon," Yeah. Another vampire comes out of nowhere and stops him. Like I said, he was being an idiot."
44549,Stefan," Wow, that is a wonderful story, Hemingway."
44550,Damon," Thanks. [Whistling ""Strangers in the Night""]"
44551,Stefan, Hmm.

44553,Alaric, I see you've mastered the Internet.
44554,Jo," One of these students showed me something called WebMD. Apparently, I have a form of retrograde amnesia. So far, I've cancelled out encephalitis and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Most of my characteristics fall under fugue-state amnesia, which is rare, but then again, so is coming back from the dead, which I just said too loudly. What?"
44555,Alaric, Nothing.
44556,Laura," Dr. Laughlin, you're back. I thought you were on sabbatical. Laura Homested, one of your interns at the med center last semester."
44557,Alaric," Oh, right. You remember Laura, who you mentioned to me, right?"
44558,Jo, Laura my star pupil.
44559,Laura," Really? You gave me a ""C"". Anyway, how was your honeymoon?"
44560,Jo," Amazing, wasn't it, Ric?"
44561,Alaric," Yeah, uh, fantastic."
44562,Laura," Oh, Dr. Laughlin, y... your nose. Your nose is bleeding."
44563,Alaric," Oh, hey, do you mind getting us some napkins?"
44564,Laura, Yeah. I'll be right back.
44565,Jo, What the hell is wrong with me?
44566,Julian," Beau, can I ask you something? Lily's concerns about me weren't entirely wrong. My time away might have affected my head a bit, nothing to worry about, of course, but, um, there is a little something that would bring me great relief. Our dearly departed Oscar had something of mine, but it wasn't on him when he died, so I thought perhaps it was in his automobile. Could you maybe figure out where it was sent? Great."
44567,Julian, We haven't met. Julian.
44568,Lorenzo, Lorenzo.
44569,Julian, Hmm. Those meat-and-cheese spirals were decadent. Your staff does fantastic work.
44570,Lorenzo, I'll send them your compliments.
44571,Julian, Hmm.
44572,Valerie, Seems a vampire soul inside a human body does not a perfect match make.

44578,Lily, What did I do to make you hate me so much?
44579,Lily," Not about me? Ever since I've been back, all you have done is try to strip me of my happiness. Answer me. What did I do wrong?"

44593,Stefan, May I ask you something? Did Julian remind you of anyone in particular tonight?

44597,Caroline," Guys, stop. The spell isn't working, ok? The bl*od's just off the map now. See? I warned you not to get your hopes up. Oh, my God!"
44598,Valerie, Not possible.
44599,Caroline, What's not possible?
44600,Valerie, Babies. They're here.
44601,Caroline," Where, huh, floating in a raft look at the map. Your spell didn't work."
44602,Valerie," They're not on the map, Caroline. They're inside of you."
44603,Caroline, What was the deal with you and Stefan?
44604,Valerie, I was the first love of Stefan's life.
44605,Valerie," Stefan, meet Julian."
44606,Julien, Does Stefan Salvatore know that you are pregnant with his child?
44607,Stefan, What?
44608,Valerie," I wanted to tell you in person, but Julian made sure there was nothing to tell."
44609,Lily, Julian makes me better.
44610,Valerie, He made her vindictive and cruel.
44611,Valerie, Lily gave Kai the idea to put Elena in that sleeping beauty coma.
44612,Stefan, I could have been a father.
44613,Stefan," I want him dead, Damon."
44614,Damon, I'm in.
44615,Lily, You're asking me to choose between you and Julian; the love of my life. Please understand.
44616,Enzo, Julian is looking for Oscar's car. I intend to find it first.
44617,Caroline," She was supposed to be Ric's wife, who died with two kids inside of her on their wedding day."
44618,Valerie, What is that?
44619,Alaric, It's my wedding video.
44620,Valerie, I recognize this chant. They were trying to save the next generation of Gemini twins. I think Alaric's babies are still alive. They're inside of you.
44621,Alaric, 23 minutes.
44622,Damon," Just enough time for me to get in, take out little Miss Stabby-Pants, and grab Caroline."
44623,Alaric," That's it? That's your plan, just take her out?"
44624,Damon," It's simple, it's classic. Come on."
44625,Alaric," Yeah. Listen. I saw the ""X"" carved in Stefan's chest. Pretty sure she's not playing tic-tac-toe. Look. This is a trap."
44626,Damon," Oh, I know it's a trap, and I'm gonna spring it so Stefan can't."
44627,Alaric," Yeah. Well, look. I didn't get a babysitter on 30 seconds' notice just to sit in the car."
44628,Damon, You're not gonna just sit in the car!
44629,Alaric," Turn, turn, turn, turn."
44630,Damon," There's no way Stefan didn't see Caroline's broadcast. He'll be here in a minute. When he gets here, pump him full of vervain so he can't hero his way in there."
44631,Alaric," If Caroline's in danger, I'm coming with you."
44632,Damon," She doesn't want Caroline. She wants him! If he goes in there, he's dead."
44633,Caroline," Stefan? Stefan, please."
44634,Damon," Guess you're gonna have to settle for the other one, Blondie."
44635,Caroline," Stefan, I..."
44636,Caroline, We apologize for the interruption to your current program. My name is Caroline.
44637,Damon," Well, that's not good."
44638,Caroline, Please listen carefully.
44639,Caroline, I have an urgent message for Stefan Salvatore.
44640,Stefan, I invited you over here because we can't keep doing this.
44641,Damon, What I think Stefan's trying to say is you have really crappy taste.
44642,Bonnie, Why would a centuries-old vampire with a bunch of witch groupies be so desperate to find anything collecting dust in the Midlothian County impound?
44643,Damon," Well, you didn't think Dad was a monster at first, but somewhere along the way, this little warning light started blinking ""Psycho! Psycho!"""
44644,Lily," What's the matter, sweetheart?"
44645,Stefan, Why is he not eating?
44646,Adult Damon," Rest in peace, Sami."
44647,Matt, I found more at the courthouse and another dozen at the supermarket.
44648,Julian, Do you know what true bravery is?
44649,Valerie, Beau.
44650,"Lily, voice-over", That's why I had to stay.
44651,Enzo, Nice aim.

44655,Alaric," Uh, I'm not really sure how to answer that."
44656,Alaric, I'm not sure you're qualified to use that.
44657,Stefan, What's going on?
44658,"Oh, yes, nothing says ""I've loved you for over a century"" like falling asleep by 9",15.
44659,"I know, it's insane. Magical baby transplants? I... I didn't believe it, either, but then I ate 9 ice cream sundaes from noon to 3","00, and none of my clothes fit, and then there was that whole part with the doctor and the ultrasound, so... Right. Yeah. You can say something."
44660,"""Hey, Stefan. Did I mention Bonnie saw me mix a bl*od bag with a jar of mayonnaise at 2","00 in the morning?"""
44661,Caroline, You have a mother?
44662,Damon, We loved her. She was our world.

44805,Enzo, Damon put Tyler in a coma.
44806,Tyler," Those aren't gonna stop me, Damon."
44807,Caroline, One... these babies aren't mine. They're Ric's...

44816,Freya, A mystical vampire huntress stabbed you with her magic sword.
44817,Stefan, She regenerates.
44818,Freya, and won't rest until you're dead.
44819,Stefan," No matter how far I run, this wound acts as a beacon, drawing her to me."
44820,Krystal, Julian's other vampires get suspicious?
44821,Rayna," Yes, I did."

44823,Damon," Barking up the wrong vampire there, sister."
44824,Damon," I know, right?"
44825,Damon, They're my girlfriend's.
44826,Rayna, What's next? It puts the lotion in the basket?
44827,Damon," Kind of, actually."
44828,Rayna," Well, why don't you just let me k*ll your brother, then you can do whatever the hell you want."
44829,Damon," Tempting, truly."
44830,Valerie, It is strange.

44833,Bonnie, The sword.
44834,Scabbed woman, Apologies.
44835,Damon, I did have a shockingly effective ally tell me that you were here.
44836,Alaric, Whoo!
44837,Stefan, Hey.
44838,Alaric, Backup! I need backup right now.
44839,Caroline," I'm sorry, Stefan."

44852,Bonnie, how one stupid decision can turn your life into something that you don't recognize.
44853,Damon," 23 minutes. That's just enough time for me to get in, take out Little Miss Stabby Pants, Oh, turn, turn, turn."
44854,Matt," All right, I did it. He's out."
44855,Damon, Previously on The Vampire Diaries...
44856,Damon, I have a way to take down Rayna at the pile of bricks called the Armory.
44857,Valerie, The Armory is a black hole of lies.
44858,Stefan," As long as I have this scar, Rayna will hunt me."
44859,Damon," But if she dies for good, everyone with that scar on your chest does as well."
44860,Stefan, I sacrificed everyone and everything for you.
44861,Matt," All right, I did it. He's out."
44862,Rayna," Sun's coming up, Stefan."
44863,Damon," It's a pretty big deal, you know?"
44864,Stefan, I'm not talking about tonight.
44865,Valerie, Not me.
44866,Rayna, No such luck.
44867,Stefan, Hey.
44868,Matt, Why are you even in Dallas?
44869,Enzo, I'm here for work.
44870,(groaning), Much better.
44871,Alex," You can stay here and yell at me if you want, but then I might not give you a car."
44872,Damon, Good afternoon.
44873,Valerie, He's refusing to participate!
44874,Damon, She's wonderful.
44875,Nora, Mary Lou?
44876,Mary Louie, You're driving.
44877,Rayna," It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan."
44878,Rayna, I felt your scar reopen.
44879,Rayna," You slowed yourself down, getting your albatross out of storage."
44880,Caroline," Matt, it's Caroline."
44881,Nora, No time for gloomy talk.
44882,Rayna, What if I were to tell you there's a way for me to transfer it to somebody a little bit more deserving?
44883,Damon," I couldn't save you, my brother."
44884,Man, Help!
44885,Woman, Help!
44886,Emt," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sit down."
44887,Stefan," I believe you, but that's not my wallet."
44888,Officer," Nice work, Marty."
44889,Rayna, I can hear them.
44890,Stefan, I woke up in the middle of the road and I saw the bus on fire.
44891,Valerie, I don't give a damn about a bunch of old vampire souls.
44892,Officer," Calm down, Marty."
44893,Stefan," My name's Stefan, damn it."
44894,Officer," All right, you asked for it."
44895,Officer, Hey! Get back here! Stop! Stop!
44896,Rayna, We have to hunt them all down.
44897,Valerie, No.
44898,Alaric, Damon.
44899,Valerie, Keep him close.
44900,Damon, Work harder.
44901,Reporter," For more on this story as it breaks, stay tuned."
44902,Rayna, Turn that down.
44903,Valerie, Focus on Stefan.
44904,"I may have forgotten what you've done, Damon, but I do remember this", you are my flesh and bl*od.
44905,Valerie, And then what?
44906,Reporter (over radio), The man is considered dangerous.
44907,Captain, I need you to call these four guys back for another shift.
44908,Damon," Didn't think that one through, did you, brother?"
44909,Man," All right, try to calm down and tell me what happened."
44910,Damon, Wow.
44911,Damon," Ah, don't tell me you don't appreciate the irony of this."
44912,Alaric," As the story goes, he wouldn't just k*ll. He would force his v*ctim to m*rder each other."
44913,Valerie, Everyone you know has made the choice
44914,Damon," Cut the crap, buddy."
44915,Alaric," Apparently, he was a serial k*ll before he became a vampire."
44916,Stefan, I got ripped out of hell
44917,Operator, 911. What's your emergency?
44918,Doctor," Thank you, Bonnie."
44919,Damon, So what'd I miss when I was gone?
44920,Crowd (chanting), Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
44921,I booked a 5,15 into Dallas/Fort Worth.
44922,Here's the thing, I can't hear you that well.
44923,Damon," Well, old Marty's heart's still b*at, thanks to the miracle of modern medicine."
44924,Driver," I majored in poli-sci, but, like, obviously, what do you do with a poli-sci degree? So..."
44925,Driver, Sorry. Got to stop.
44926,Bonnie, Thanks.
44927,Virginia," Same as you, I guess. I was betrayed by someone I loved. Except it was my family, not my boyfriend."
44928,Frank, Sorry about that.
44929,Ambrose," You look like you're in pretty bad shape, Stefan, hmm?"
44930,Damon, Bonnie?
44931,Bonnie, You weren't even gonna say good-bye.
44932,Alaric, Bonnie's undercover at a psych ward in Nasheville.
44933,Enzo, I need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed.
44934,Rayna, The effects of my bl*od
44935,Damon," Bonnie, I..."
44936,Bonnie, You know what?
44937,Bonnie, Not all.
44938,Waitress, Order up.
44939,Alex, Doing what?
44940,Bonnie, Don't be ridiculous.
44941,Enzo," Come now, surely this qualifies as a date, of a sort."
44942,Stefan, Yeah?
44943,Bonnie, Damon!
44944,Lizzie," Mommy, read us a story."
44945,Damon, Remember how Rayna was gonna give Bonnie her last life after we finished her hit list?
44946,Alex, Virginia forced Lucy Benett to seal a vault in the Armory with magic.
44947,Enzo, I need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed.
44948,Woman (over PA)," Dr. Flores dial 182, please."
44949,Woman's voice (whispering), Dalton...
44950,Woman's voice, Dalton.
44951,Virginia, It strips away your compassion.
44952,Virginia," It takes away your empathy, your capacity for love."
44953,Damon," Well, then we better get moving."
44954,Damon, How's it going?
44955,Damon," Ah, good. Overachiever."
44956,"Stefan, answering your question about how to deal with being hated, three little words", Just don't care.
44957,Bonnie, Where's Enzo?
44958,Young woman, Alexandria?
44959,Yvette, I'm so alone.
44960,Rayna," Now they're getting close, they're about to..."
44961,Bonnie, Hey.
44962,Damon, I know where you are right now.
44963,Alex," I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet."
44964,Stefan," Yeah, I was there."
44965,Man, Ashlynn!
44966,Man, Help me!
44967,Man, Professor Saltzman.
44968,Bonnie, Rayna?
44969,Bonnie, Rayna.
44970,Stefan," It was an accident, Matt."
44971,Matt, You compelled me.
44972,Alex, Put her on.
44973,Caroline, What?
44974,Alex," (whispering) Thank you, Bonnie."
44975,Young woman, (whispering) Alexandria.
44976,Young woman, (whispering) Alexandria.
44977,Young woman, (whispering) Alexandria.
44978,Alex," Bonnie, please!"
44979,Penny," Yes, Mrs. Sergeant Donovan."
44980,Stefan," You can't blame yourself, Matt."
44981,Caroline," I didn't have anything to say to him then, and I don't have anything to say about him now."
44982,Enzo, I need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed.
44983,Rayna," When she wakes, she'll be just like me."
44984,Bonnie, I don't know.
44985,Enzo," Considering you were on death's door, that's probably a good thing."
44986,Caroline," I think she's better off in here, don't you think?"
44987,Stefan, I just wanted to see if you needed anything.
44988,Alaric, Now for our favorite subject.
44989,Woman, Invite them to the party.
44990,Caroline, My God.
44991,Enzo," Something wrong, Deputy?"
44992,Damon," All right, Bonnie, I really need this to work."
44993,Caroline," In 30 miles, take 95 north, and we should be in Maine by tomorrow night."
44994,Matt," Bonnie! Bonnie, I can help you!"
44995,Damon, Yeah. In a coffin.
44996,Virginia, Whatever's inside that vault...
44997,Rayna," When she wakes, she'll be just like me... full of hatred for you and your kind."
44998,Enzo," Bonnie's life is linked to that of the final Everlasting. If we sever the link, it might also sever the curse."
44999,Stefan (over phone), You haven't heard from him?
45000,Damon, Nope.
45001,Damon," Look... best case scenario, we destroy it, everything goes back to normal."
45002,Enzo," Oh, you mean the ambiguously terrifying monster from the vault?"
45003,Stefan," That's great, but I have absolutely no idea where to find her."
45004,Caroline," No, it's for us."
45005,"(distorted, muffled)", She can probably hear what we're saying right now.
45006,Josie," Then Lizzie had three cookies, and I only had two."
45007,This sure is a lot of cookie talk for 8,00 in the morning.
45008,Dispatch," All units, we have a six-car pileup on eastbound 60 at Franklin Drive."
45009,Stefan," Salvatore Airlines, may I help you?"
45010,Caroline, Want to know something cool?
45011,Damon, Enzo says that the final Everlasting is in a coffin somewhere.
45012,(groaning), I'm trying... but I dare say you've gotten stronger.
45013,Remember the other ones," New Year's Eve and champagne... and your terrible, terrible guitar playing that never really got any better, even though I said it did."
45014,Elena (echoing), Damon...
45015,Bonnie, Hello?
45016,Elena (echoing), Damon...
45017,Bonnie, Damon.
45018,Elena," Damon, help me."
45019,Elena, Please...
45020,Elena," Please, help me."
45021,Elena, I'm so alone.
45022,Elena, Right here.
45023,Enzo, I don't leave people behind.
45024,Caroline," Dear Elena, we were so close."
45025,Caroline, Completely cleaned out.
45026,Caroline, I'm worried about Bonnie.
45027,Matt," I reached out to all my contacts, knowing they'd show up sooner or later."
45028,Stefan, It was three months before we heard the first rumor... a string of missing persons on the West Coast.
45029,Caroline," Dear Elena, we were so close."
45030,Elena, Damon.
45031,Damon, It only hurts at first.
45032,Caroline, I'm worried about Bonnie.
45033,Stefan, It was three months before we heard the first rumor.
45034,Cindy, Watch out!
45035,Damon, Come on.
45036,Damon," Okay, a little backstory because it's only fair... My friend here, Enzo, and I are the unwilling employees..."
45037,(softly)," No, no, no."
45038,(crying)," Oh, God, no."
45039,Bonnie," Dear Elena, for the next week, you'll be reading updates from me."
45040,"But it's just you and me talking right now, and I need to tell you", it's hard.
45041,Enzo," Darling, your guitar playing would send Odysseus sailing in the other direction."
45042,Bonnie," No idea what that means, but screw you."
45043,(quietly), Thank you.
45044,Caroline, And then she cut their sandwiches into the shapes of little hearts and stars.
45045,(softly), Yeah.
45046,Georgie, Yes!
45047,(singsongy), It can hear you.
45048,Stefan," Look, I know it's not much, but it's a lead."
45049,Dorian, It's an optical illusion.
45050,Dorian, We don't know yet.
45051,Caroline, This is a work movie that Mommy's been waiting for.
45052,Georgie, What was that back there?
45053,Stefan, Excuse me.
45054,Brody, This is Brody.
45055,Brody," Okay, I will."
45056,Bonnie, They're still processing the scene.
45057,Damon, Stefan.
45058,Stefan, Don't do anything you might regret.
45059,(softly), Go.
45060,Damon, Don't you two get it?
45061,Enzo, You really never read The Odyssey?
45062,Bonnie, Is that the one with Helen of Troy?
45063,Enzo," ""Meanwhile, I took a large round of wax, cut it up small with my sharp sword,"
45064,Enzo," ""Then they bound me hand and foot, standing me up by the step of the ship's mast and then lashing me to the mast itself."""
45065,Damon, I am a fan of the homegrown art community.
45066,Stefan," Dear Elena, it's not my turn, but I wanted you to hear it from me."
45067,Elena," I know, Bonnie. You're right."
45068,Stefan, I won't give up on him.
45069,Bonnie," ""They bewitch everybody who approaches them. There is no homecoming for the man who draws near them unawares... (sobbing) ...with their high clear song, the Sirens bewitch him..."""
45070,Alaric, How very poetic.
45071,Bonnie, Not just poetic. It's real.
45072,Georgie, So are you ready for us to blow your mind?
45073,Alaric, Can't believe you guys found this.
45074,Georgie, Except for that guy.
45075,Damon, Our job is to bring the worst of humanity and bring them here. What's the worst thing you've ever done in your life?
45076,Bonnie, He left me all these clues pointing to an old story about the Sirens?
45077,Alaric, Sirens use mind control to lure their v*ctim to their death. Some say they're messengers of the devil.
45078,Bonnie," That wasn't Enzo, that's wasn't Damon. They're not in control. And all those clues, he wanted us to find them. Next time we'll get them back from whatever it is that has ahold of them."
45079,Man," Started out in sales, moved up the ladder, next thing you know, I'm in charge of the whole darn operation."
45080,Man, Why bring sand to the beach?
45081,(laughing), Kidding.
45082,Damon, I don't know.
45083,Sybil," Come on, you think the same thing I do."
45084,Because I need him to be like you, all in.
45085,Caroline," Dear Elena. Hope this isn't too messy, because I'm doing the mom thing of grabbing any spare moment to write, evenin my parked car. It's my turn to be the bearer of not entirely bad tidings, because finally there's some good news too. Bonnie heard from Enzo... sort of. He left something for her to find. It wasn't exactly a love note, but it looks like he's on our side. And elsewhere, in actual romance... The Salvatore House is about to become my official residence. I absolutely love it. The water pressure needs some work, but Stefan seems to be very focused on home improvements."
45086,Caroline," Either that or he just needs a way to get out his frustration about losing Damon's trail again. On a brighter note, there have been zero unwanted houseguests since last week's craziness. Lizzie and Josie are blissfully unaware that they were ever in any danger. I wish Ric and I could say the same. He was just as freaked out as I was, but he's distracting himself by researching our new enemy. Whatever real-life, supernatural thing is controlling our friends, Ric will find a way to fight it."
45087,Caroline, Hey.
45088,Alaric," Oh, they know that."
45089,(whispering voice), I'll call you later.
45090,Damon, Katherine.
45091,Elena," Um, no, uh..."
45092,Elena, Got into a fight with my boyfriend.
45093,Damon," About what, may I ask?"
45094,Damon, You don't want it?
45095,Damon, You want what everybody wants.
45096,Elena, Tell me.
45097,Sybil, Why is he always napping?
45098,Caroline," Yeah, and both women died of neck wounds."
45099,Caroline, And the second v*ctim is Sarah Jane Nelson.
45100,Stefan, Because there's another Sarah Nelson living in North Carolina.
45101,Stefan, He wouldn't.
45102,Georgie, Where's Harvey?
45103,A, I've yet to see you take your research assignment seriously.
45104,B, I am down here because this room is literally buried in untapped information.
45105,Alaric," Shut up, Georgie."
45106,"Easy, she has a new priority", giving you a spanking.
45107,Enzo," A gentleman introduces himself first, Damon Salvatore."
45108,Sarah," Look, I get it... you're my long-lost whatever, you feel bad it came to this, at last we finally meet."
45109,Lizzie," Seline, Mommy wants to..."
45110,Alaric, Am I gonna find cigarette butts on these flagstones?
45111,Sybil, So... who's Elena?
45112,Elena," I know, Bonnie, you're right."
45113,Damon, Katherine.
45114,Elena," The most real thing that I've ever felt in my entire life. Promise me this is forever. I love you, Damon."
45115,Stefan, You can still make this right.
45116,Bonnie, What happened?
45117,Stefan, Caroline?
45118,8,00 a.m. tomorrow?
45119,Georgie," Hey, man. You owe me and not just for the take-out dinner I had to buy on my paltry stipend."
45120,Enzo," Back on task, I see."
45121,Alaric, Sirens use mind control to lure their v*ctim to their death. Some say they're messengers of the devil.
45122,Stefan," Yeah, he is. I saw it happen."
45123,(echoing), Dad?
45124,Officer, The car went off the bridge.
45125,Officer, We'll need to drag the river.
45126,Officer, It's the Gilberts.
45127,Sybil," In three millennia, I have a pretty unblemished record when it comes to controlling men."
45128,Damon," Well, he's a tough nut crack."
45129,Sybil, Is that so?
45130,Damon, I can make it final.
45131,Bonnie, Everything that happens is his fault.
45132,Damon, You know I needed motivation.
45133,Bonnie," I'm sure there are a million people we'd both rather be with right now, but..."
45134,Damon, I don't know.
45135,Georgie, There's nothing in the historical records about a w*apon like this.
45136,Alaric," All right, I didn't cut them into star shapes like Seline does, but I've got some really cool square shapes for you."
45137,Josie, I had it first.
45138,Alaric, Shh...
45139,Sybil, Five minutes.
45140,(laughs), No.
45141,Damon, You two forget that
45142,Sybil," What about you, Caroline?"
45143,Sybil," When Damon and Enzo start tearing each other apart, do you really think Stefan is gonna let Enzo k*ll his brother?"
45144,Damon, I brought you here because you are my brother.
45145,When that clock strikes 3,"00, I'm gonna be counting on you to remember that."
45146,Sybil, Aw.
45147,Bonnie," Damon, no."
45148,Sybil, He can't.
45149,Sybil, Damon?
45150,Damon," No. Bonnie, don't do this to me."
45151,Damon, I know where I'm going when I die.
45152,Sybil, Hmm.
45153,Bonnie, Enzo.
45154,Sybil," I don't know who you are, but..."
45155,Stefan," Dear Elena, where to begin?"
45156,Bartender, Here you go.
45157,Sybil, Damon is completely devoted to me.
45158,Georgie," This thing, it was delivered with your vault inhabitant."
45159,Alaric, Sirens use mind control to lure their v*ctim to their death.
45160,(shivering), Tell me a story.
45161,But Cade could do something that no one else could, he could see into the minds of others.
45162,Girl, Cade had only wanted to help.
45163,And it was then that Cade came to know the thing inside men that even his power had not been able to divine, true evil.
45164,Caroline, Hey.
45165,Georgie," Oh, hey."
45166,"See, the catch is"," Sybil and I had a thing, but it's done."
45167,Sybil, The fate of psychics was exile.
45168,(chuckling)," Oh, did I forget to mention there are two of us?"
45169,(laughs)," Well, luckily for us all, you can't believe everything that you read."
45170,Seline," Don't move, or I call the police!"
45171,Sybil, But the girl of the island knew better.
45172,(softly), God.
45173,Stefan, Or maybe there were no boars on the island.
45174,(softly), I tried.
45175,(voice breaking), I tried so hard to be good.
45176,It all comes down to the same question," which siren is your spirit animal, Stefan?"
45177,Sybil," Stefan, you've met my sister."
45178,Elizabeth, Will you tell us a story?
45179,(whispering), No telling Mommy or Daddy.
45180,"But for the last time, I need to know", are you an island girl or a village girl?
45181,(quietly), Oh... help... somebody help...
45182,Sybil, But God never answered me.
45183,(whispers), Yes.
45184,Sybil, The people he loved damned him.
45185,Peter," So Mystic Falls is overrun with supernatural creatures, and... vampires are real."
45186,Peter," Hey, listen, Matt. Why don't you, uh..."
45187,"It's just that, in this case, (laughing)", I really do have to k*ll the messenger.
45188,(screaming), No! No!
45189,Stefan," I really hoped that when we put Sybil down, it'd break whatever control she had over him, but she still has ahold of him."
45190,(bad British accent)," Mmm. Why, I do declare, this is some of the best purple tea I've ever had."
45191,Alaric," Dear Elena, I don't know where to start."
45192,(chuckling), Yeah. They would love that.
45193,Lizzie, Seline.
45194,Damon, I was wondering when you guys were gonna show up.
45195,Damon, Easy.
45196,Stefan," Is that why you came home, Damon?"
45197,Caroline," Damon, just go."
45198,Caroline, It was awful.
45199,Enzo, Dead friend problems?
45200,Tyler," Matt, if you got this, it means I'm dead, which sucks. It also means I need your help finding someone."
45201,(chuckling), Almost.
45202,Caroline," I swear, if Seline wasn't so good with the girls, I would hate her."
45203,(laughing), Oh.
45204,(chuckling), Nice try.
45205,Enzo," Congratulations, you nailed it."
45206,(coughing), I'm not leaving you.
45207,Lizze and Josie, Incendia.
45208,Enzo, Of course I did.
45209,Alaric, He was strong.
45210,Enzo, He fought the darkness inside himself and won.
45211,Stefan," Look, we don't know what'll happen next to any of us."
45212,Alaric, Dear Elena...
45213,Seline, Hey.
45214,Alaric, Girls?
45215,Girls, Incendia.
45216,Detective, When was the last time you saw the nanny?
45217,Alaric, Let me speak to them.
45218,Woman," Hey, sissy."
45219,(sighs), I'm famished.
45220,Sybil," It's obvious, isn't it?"
45221,(sharp groan)," God, the pain is moving, and it feels like I'm being cut open."
45222,(echoing), ...greasy diner food with the other.
45223,Waitress, Let me top that off for ya.
45224,Sybil, Ooh.
45225,Stefan, Just make sure she knows I'm doing everything I can.
45226,Damon, Here's what I don't get.
45227,Sybil, Blah blah blah.
45228,Damon, Wow.
45229,(chuckling), I'm not telling you.
45230,"We have a pool, we have some residents... ah, and-and look", free HBO.
45231,Sybil, I'm already doing what I want with you.
45232,Enzo, I'm not sure which one of you to kiss first.
45233,Alaric, No.
45234,Matt, What is it?
45235,Caroline, Where are the girls?
45236,Stefan, And you're going to be my wife and Ric is my friend and Damon is my brother.
45237,Girls, Incendia.
45238,"Piece of advice, Stefan", k*ll him before he k*ll you.
45239,And another piece of advice, Turn around. Now.
45240,Cade, So... you want your freedom in exchange for these two sweet girls.
45241,Alaric," Hey, darling. Hey."
45242,Alaric," Oh, my gosh."
45243,Caroline, Thank you.
45244,Caroline, I missed you too.
45245,Alaric, Hey...
45246,Caroline," I missed you, too."
45247,(crying), No. What? Why?
45248,Both, Incendia.
45249,Damon," How does an evil siren scheme, involve three-year-olds?"
45250,Damon, Who's Cade?
45251,Stefan, I'll do it.
45252,Seline, I'm done.
45253,Stefan, I surrendered my immortal soul to Cade.
45254,Stefan," Dear Elena, This might be my last entry."
45255,Stefan, Hey.
45256,Enzo," Well, what about the tuning fork?"
45257,Damon, You don't have to hide them.
45258,Sybil, My sister kidnapped them.
45259,Bonnie, Caroline?
45260,Damon, Relax. He's not dead.
45261,Lizzie, Uncle Stefan says our palace is the safest place in the whole world.
45262,Lizzie, And Seline.
45263,Sybil, (gasps) Ooh!
45264,Caroline," Well, Damon's alive, as you can see."

45270,Sybil, What about this...
45271,Seline, Don't hang up.
45272,Stefan, I don't remember doing this.
45273,Cade, That you showed remorse meant nothing to me.
45274,Cade, She altered your subconscious enough that you forgot on your own.
45275,Peter, I told you.
45276,(imitating Peter)," ""Uh, I guess I gambled and cheated on account of my dishonesty."""

45289,Caroline, What are you going to do?
45290,All," Hi, Damon."
45291,Man, Why don't you tell us about what brought you to the meeting today?
45292,Stefan, Wow.
45293,Damon," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
45294,Caroline," Dear Elena, Sorry it's been a while."
45295,Matt, Anybody here?
45296,Caroline, Wow!
45297,Students," Good morning, Miss Sybil."
45298,Damon," Nah. If we sent people to Cade just for being bad tippers, there'd be no room left in hell."
45299,Matt, No.
45300,Dorian, Here's another artifact that could help.
45301,Dorian, Really?
45302,Stefan, It's just karma.
45303,Sybil, This place has gone downhill since 1790.
45304,Caroline, I always forget you're so much older than you look.
45305,Dorian," Anyway, according to this, the bell measurements are an exact match to what Dalton St. John wrote about."
45306,Sybil, Peter Maxwell was the last one to have his hands on that witches' bell.
45307,(weakly)," Tara, listen to me."
45308,Damon," I wish I could go back and change it, but I can't."

45314,Damon, Psst.
45315,Damon," Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway."
45316,Inmate, Your brother's a troublemaker?
45317,Damon, He's keeping it together.
45318,Dorian, Seline m*rder my friend.
45319,Dorian, The Maxwell heirloom and the tuning fork.
45320,Sybil, You seem so rational when it comes to your daughter's safety.
45321,Damon," If my brother takes a turn for the worse, all bets are off."
45322,Sybil, There's that Damon sense of humor I miss.
45323,(as Enzo)," ""A mere symbol of an eternity with you, love."""
45324,Seline," Hey, I am trying to make amends."
45325,Here's the only thing you need to focus on, payback.
45326,Sybil, I invited them.
45327,Caroline," It should look effortless, ladies."
45328,Dorian, Don't move. Don't speak.
45329,Caroline (clapping)," Finishing touches, ladies."
45330,Sybil, Your friendly neighborhood siren.
45331,Stefan, You didn't hand over that stupid ball Sybil wants...
45332,Caroline, Miss Trudy Sulez...
45333,Caroline, ...escorted by Garrett Tanner.
45334,Caroline, And Miss Flora Martinez...
45335,Stefan, Then why... are you still holding onto this?
45336,Enzo," No loss, no grief, no end."
45337,(quietly), What do you think it's gonna feel like if you keep fighting?
45338,Stefan, No.
45339,Bonnie, It was wrong of me to give you back the necklace.
45340,Damon, Ah... back from the dead.
45341,Sybil, Your humanity is gonna flood back...
45342,Bonnie," Damon, he's your friend! Stop!"
45343,Sybil, ...and crush you.
45344,Tyler," You k*ll me, no one forgives you for this."
45345,Sybil," I'm not the thing inside your head you have to fear, Damon. You are."
45346,Damon, I wrote you a letter.
45347,Peter, Don't walk away from your family.
45348,Dorian," The Maxwell heirloom and the tuning fork, those things fit together to make the hammer that swings inside a bell."
45349,Caroline," One day, you're going to realize that you don't even remember what happiness is."
45350,Sybil," I'm not the thing inside your head you have to fear, Damon. You are."
45351,Translation," you are still in bed, moping about Stefan."
45352,But the real question is, what did she do to his brain this time?
45353,Deputy," Hey, Sheriff."
45354,(whispers), Oh.
45355,Seline," Thanks for the call, Matt."
45356,Matt, I'm not doing this for you.
45357,Stefan," I can't let you do that, Matt."
45358,"Oh, and Ripper tip"," if you're plotting to m*rder someone, you should probably keep a lower profile."
45359,Seline, You want those souls?
45360,(groans), Oh.
45361,(whispers), I like it.
45362,(chuckles), Who am I kidding?
45363,Man," You shouldn't be here, Bonnie."
45364,(whispers), No excuses.
45365,Bonnie, Don't worry.
45366,"Well, since Stefan compelled me to ring the bell by 9","00, I'd say we're in the clear."
45367,Stefan, Wow. You really can't take a hint.
45368,Cade, My beautiful children.
45369,Seline, We can do better.
45370,Stefan," Oh, yes, you are, Matt."
45371,Caroline, I will do whatever it takes.
45372,Man, There's so many options.
45373,Bonnie (laughing)," Oh, my God."
45374,Dorian," You put the cardan grille over text, and it reveals a hidden message."
45375,Bonnie, I didn't buy the house for you.
45376,Stefan, Uh-uh-uh...
45377,Stefan, Congratulations.
45378,Stefan, One more thing.
45379,Caroline, I just sent the last guy home... after compelling him to forget today's not-so-happy hour.
45380,Matt, Great. Now we can all pretend like this day never happened... except for the people who are dead.
45381,Stefan," Now, unless you're in a hovercraft, you're not gonna catch me in time."
45382,Damon, Donovan called in some favors.
45383,Stefan," Well, I'm not on my way to Brooklyn."
45384,Stefan," Damon, we work for a psychic. Did you forget?"
45385,Bonnie, Come inside.
45386,Damon, Stefan... listen to me.
45387,Stefan, Let me guess.
45388,Stefan, I'm not doing this for Cade.
45389,Stefan, That's exactly my point.
45390,Bonnie, Yeah.
45391,Enzo, Nonsense.
45392,Bonnie, How much bl*od should I take?
45393,(echoing), Enzo!
45394,Matt, I got a question for you.
45395,Seline, All you got to do is make sure that bell rings 12 times.
45396,Cade, The task I gave both of you was k*ll 100 people or k*ll your brother's girl.
45397,Damon," Bonnie, hey."
45398,Caroline, Stefan?
45399,Dorian, Maybe you were.
45400,Alaric," Well, I've heard of Latvian witches using something like that to contact the dead."
45401,Enzo [whispering], Bonnie.
45402,[whispers], Bonnie.
45403,Caroline, Thank you.
45404,Officer, And when did you last see your mom?
45405,Girl, Yesterday.
45406,Alaric, That's good.
45407,Alaric," Okay, Matt, picture yourself there."
45408,Matt, We're in the caves.
45409,You know him by another name, the devil.
45410,Matt," Seline's there, too."
45411,Enzo, Bonnie.
45412,Stefan," No, no, no, no. Save her."
45413,Matt, He's encoded a message for her.
45414,Matt, One.
45415,Matt, Two.
45416,Matt, The witches are trying to hold back the flames and save the town.
45417,Damon, Hey!
45418,Matt, Bea... Bea.
45419,[whispers], b*at.
45420,Seline," Ethan, if your friend will not free us, then you must k*ll her."
45421,Matt, He's trying to tell her the only way he can.
45422,[whispers], Bonnie.
45423,[groaning]," Caroline, it doesn't matter."
45424,Damon, Sybil sure loved to hear herself talk.
45425,Damon, Bonnie's a much better person than you or me.
45426,Ethan, What is this?
45427,Matt," Dad, get up!"
45428,Kai, Is that weird or what?
45429,[laughing]," I mean, I can still touch stuff."
45430,Alaric, The kid's a sociopath.
45431,Bonnie, You know what?
45432,[whispering], Stop it.
45433,Kai," So, wait, that's what kept them going?"
45434,"If hell is fueled by evil, and I'm still a little bit in hell, then maybe I can secure my footing here on Earth by-by k*ll a really bad person [whispering]", just like those sexy sirens did.
45435,Damon, He'll do.
45436,[sighs]," Oh, my God, Ric, come by and meet you that would be just amazing."
45437,[chuckles]," Well, maybe 100% isn't a realistic goal."
45438,Male voice, Bonnie.
45439,Male voice, Bonnie.
45440,Matt," Slow down, slow down."
45441,[echoing], Stefan!
45442,Caroline [voice echoing], Won't heal him anymore...
45443,Bonnie, Enzo.
45444,[Groaning], Ow.
45445,Bonnie, I gave him the cure. He's human now.
45446,Caroline, Why don't you give yourself a chance to discover who you are now?
45447,Cade, You shouldn't talk to yourself and expect an answer.
45448,Damon," Careful, brother."
45449,Cliff Notes, I had a nasty run-in with our old friend Kai Parker.
45450,Lizzie, I love this dress.

45454,Damon, Sorry.
45455,[Whispering], This guy.
45456,[Imitating Hannibal Lecter]," Hello, Clarice."
45457,[Whispering], Look around.
45458,[Laughing]," Like, easily, the worst."
45459,[Echoing], Cade?
45460,Damon," We had a deal, Cade."
45461,Cade, The question is which soul will you save?
45462,Cade," I'm curious, Damon."
45463,Stefan, Fine.
45464,Lizzie, And Josie slipped off.
45465,Josie," Yeah, I fell, but I was okay."
45466,Lizzie, She wasn't hurt.
45467,Josie, But she got scared.
45468,Lizzie," Yeah, I got scared."
45469,Damon," Hiding ain't my style, Cade."
45470,"I was hoping you'd say that, but I warn you"," if you attempt to keep Damon's soul on this plane, your mind will surely shatter."
45471,Damon," He's right, Bon."
45472,Damon, Please.
45473,[Grunting], Bonnie.
45474,Damon, Am I late for the group hug?
45475,Bonnie, Damon.
45476,Bonnie," That's impossible, because Cade's dead, and hell no longer exists."
45477,Kai," In fact, thanks to you k*ll Cade, hell's never been in better hands."
45478,Damon, What are you talking about?
45479, SELINE," When the door between this world and Cade's gets cracked open, it wipes out everything for miles."
45480, MAN, Hey!
45481, BONNIE, These psychic dimensions are tied to emotional trauma.
45482, DAMON, How are those vows coming?
45483, DAMON, Did it this morning.
45484, TRUDY," She told me not to post video, but screw her."
45485, DAMON," All right, bulletin."
45486, ALARIC," Yeah, well, you and I both know that Katherine would smell a rat if they weren't there."
45487, - Ric - JOSIE, Can I wear this?
45488, [whispering] ," Ah, thank you."
45489, [whispering] , Mommy looks so pretty.
45490, STEFAN," By the way, I think you may have gone a little bit overboard with the number of compelled guests."
45491, DAMON," Well, I mean, Stefan, it had to look authentic."
45492, CAROLINE," You girls will go in front of Mommy, and then Mommy will just walk herself down the aisle, and it will all be fine."
45493, BONNIE, Or I could walk with you.
45494, [crying] , Oh I have a selfish reason.
45495, DAMON, Dearly beloved.
45496, DAMON," With the power recently vested in me by the Commonwealth of Virginia, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
45497, I DAMON, Paging the bride and groom.
45498, [in raspy voice] , Super hot.
45499, ENZO," You have to keep moving, luv."
45500, Say these words, Phesmatos motus incendiaros.
45501, Phesmatos ALL, motus incendiaros.
45502, DAMON, Except Vicki's dead as a doornail.
45503, KELLY, She was.
45504, DAMON, Except Vicki's dead.
45505, KELLY, She was.
45506, STEFAN, There has to be something.
45507, ELENA, Damon?
45508, At 10,"00 p. m. , Mystic Falls will burn, precious Elena will burn and I'm guessing one of you two Salvatores are going down with her."
45509, STEFAN [over phone] , She's not in the house.
45510, OFFICER," Come on, keep it moving!"
45511, CAROLINE, Kai spelled her in.
45512, BONNIE, What do you mean?
45513, [crying] , don't make me leave you.
45514, [crying] , No.
45515, BONNIE, You okay?
45516, ALARIC, That is Project Hail-Mary.
45517, BONNIE," I think I do, but the only way it gets rid of Katherine Pierce is if she's in hell when I destroy it."
45518, MATT," All right, guys, keep it moving."
45519, But I don't Bonnie ALARIC, Caroline.
45520, BONNIE, Ric will fill you in.

45525, GIRL," six, seven, eight."
45526, CAROLINE, I can't believe it.
45527, BONNIE, It's our last hurrah before you guys go off to college.
45528, CAROLINE, Before we go off to college.
45529, STEFAN," Uh, pardon me, is this the men's room?"
45530, ELENA," Yes, um, it's a long story."
45531, DAMON, Go.
45532, STEFAN," Without the cure, I'd start to age."
45533, LEXI," Well, that was beautiful."
45534, BONNIE, Phesmatos incendia 
45535, ELENA," Dear Diary, today will be different."
45536, ELENA, This life will be good and beautiful.

45542, BONNIE," I'm determined to keep my promise to Enzo, I'm gonna live this life to the fullest."
45543, ENZO, Passport.
45544, ALARIC," And as for my family, Caroline and I got what Damon decided was Stefan's last wish."
45545, BOTH, Daddy!
45546, CAROLINE, Opening the school was hard work.
45547, ALARIC, Caroline was determined to make it a success.
45548, ALARIC," Plus, soon after the school opened, she got a most impressive donor."
45549, ELENA," After med school, I came home to Mystic Falls."
45550, ELENA," Even after our long and happy life together, Damon is worried he'll never see Stefan again, that he'll never find peace."
